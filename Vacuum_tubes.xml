The '''nuvistor''' is a type of [[vacuum tube]] announced by [[RCA]] in 1959.  Most nuvistors are basically [[thimble]]-shaped, but somewhat smaller than a thimble, and much smaller than conventional tubes of the day.  [[Triode]]s and a few [[tetrode]]s were made. The tube is made entirely of metal and ceramic. Making nuvistors requires special equipment, since there is no intubation to pump gases out of the envelope. Instead, the entire structure is assembled, inserted into its metal envelope, sealed and processed in a large vacuum chamber with simple robotic devices.

Nuvistors are among the highest performing small signal receiving tubes.  They feature excellent VHF and UHF performance plus low noise figures, and were widely used throughout the 1960s in [[television set]]s (beginning with RCA's &quot;New Vista&quot; line of color sets in 1961 with the CTC-11 chassis) and radio equipment and high-fidelity equipment, primarily in RF sections.  They competed with the [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] revolution, and along with GE's [[Compactron]], probably held it at bay for a few years.  RCA discontinued their use in television tuners for its product line in late 1971.  One famous application was in the [[Ampex]] MR-70, a costly studio tape recorder whose entire electronics section was based on nuvistors. Another limited application of this very small tube was in studio-grade microphones from that era, the AKG/Norelco C12a, which employed the 7586, being a good example. It was also later found that, with minor circuit modification, the nuvistor made a sufficient replacement for the obsolete Telefunken VF14 tube, used in the famed Neumann [[U 47]] studio [[microphone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telefunken-elektroakustik.com/products/show_product.php?item=12 Telefunken: TELEFUNKEN U47M (EF14)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
* 7586 - First one released, medium mu triode
* 7587 - Sharp cutoff tetrode
* 8056 - triode for low plate voltages
* 8058 - triode, with plate cap &amp; grid on shell, for UHF performance
* 7895 - 7586 with higher mu
* 2CW4 - Same as type 6CW4, but with a 2.1 volt / 450 milliampere heater.  Used in television receivers with series heater strings
* 6CW4 - high mu triode, most common one in consumer electronics
* 6DS4 - remote cutoff 6CW4
* 6DV4 - medium mu, intended as UHF oscillator, shell sometimes gold plated
* 8393 - medium mu, used in Tektronix scopes (12.6 volt filament)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7316">'''6SN7''' is a dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] with an 8-pin [[Tube socket#Octal base|octal base]]. It provided a medium gain (20). Note that ‘6SN7’ is not an actual tube designation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 6SN7 Identification Guide|url=http://www.head-fi.org/t/209782/the-6sn7-identification-guide|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but indicates a ''family'' of tubes such as 6SN7-GT... the 6SN7 was mostly made in a [[GT size]] glass envelope.  The 6SN7 is basically two '''6J5''' triodes in one envelope.

==History==
Originally released in 1939 it was officially registered in 1941 by RCA and Sylvania as the glass-cased '''6SN7GT''', originally listed on page 235 of RCA's 1940 RC-14 Receiving Tube Manual, in the Recently Added section, as: '''6SN7-GT'''. Although the 6S-series tubes are often metal-cased, there was never a ''metal-envelope'' 6SN7 (there being no pin available to connect the metal shield); there were, however, a few glass-envelope tubes with a metal band, such as the '''6SN7A''' developed during World War II - slightly improved in some respects but the metal band was prone to splitting.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  Numerous variations on the '''6SN7''' type have been offered over the years, including:
* '''7N7''' (Sylvania 1940, short-lived loktal-base version),
* '''1633''' (RCA 1941, also for 26-V radios),
* '''12SX7''' (RCA 1946, intended for use in 26-volt aircraft electronics),
* '''5692''' (RCA 1948, a super-premium version - not exactly identical - with guaranteed 10,000 hour lifetime),
* '''6Н8С''' (Soviet version, circa 1950, sometimes written: '''6n8s''');
* '''6SN7 DDR''', '''6Н8М''', '''E1606''' (='''CV278'''), '''OSW3129''' versions with different/larger glass enevelopes;
* '''6042''' (1951, another 1633 type), and
* '''6180''' (1952)
* '''6SN7W''' (1956; a more rugged military version, glass enevelope with metal band)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6SN7W at the National Valve Museum|url=http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aad0076.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American military designator for the 6SN7GA was '''VT-231''', and the British called it '''CV1988'''. European designations include the 1942 '''ECC32''' (not an exact equivalent), '''13D2''' and '''B65'''.

The 6SN7 has a 6.3 V 600 mA heater/filament. The 12-volt 300 mA filament equivalent is the '''12SN7GT''' or '''12SN7GTA'''. The '''14N7''' is the Loktal version of the 12SN7GT. There was also a comparatively rare 8V '''8SN7''' for 450&amp;nbsp;mA series-string TV sets) and 25 Volt/0.15 Amp heater version: '''25SN7GT'''.

== Related Types ==
The 1937 '''6F8G'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6F8G|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6f8g.html|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also an octal-based double triode with essentially the same characteristics as the 6SN7 (or two 6J5's), but in a 'Coke Bottle' large (Outline ST-12) glass envelope with a different pin arrangement and utilising a top cap connection for the first triode's grid (making pin 1 available for a metal shield).

== 6J5 ==
The '''6J5''', first registered in June 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6J5|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6j5.html|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''6J5GT''' (registered April 1938; British version '''L63''') were octal single triodes with identical characteristics to one half of a 6SN7.   Other equivalents to the 6J5 include: 
* '''VT-94''', '''6C2''', '''6J5M''', '''38565J'''; 
* military versions: '''CV1933''', '''10E/11448''' and '''CV1934'''; 
* [[Loktal]] base version: '''7A4''' (military name: '''CV1770'''), and 
* 12.6 V heater version: '''12J5'''. 
They in turn were successors to the 1935 RCA '''6C5''' and 1938 '''6P5G'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6J5|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6j5.html|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successors to the 6SN7 ==
The 1954 '''6CG7'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6CG7|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6cg7.html|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''6FQ7''' are electrically equivalent to the 6SN7, with [[Tube socket#Noval base|9-pin miniature (&quot;Noval&quot;)]] base (RCA, 1951), also made as an 8.4V 450mA series string heater type as the '''8CG7'''.

The 1948 '''ECC40''' with [[Tube socket#Rimlock base|Rimlock base]] can also considered a successor to the 6SN7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ECC40|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_ecc40.html|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (but closer in characteristics to the ECC32). The 1946 miniature [[12AU7]]/'''ECC82''', with similar, but not identical, electrical characteristics to the 6SN7 and ECC32, and a filament usable on either 6.3 or 12.6V supplies, was more widely used than the 6CG7/6FQ7.

== Usage ==
The 6SN7 was often used as an audio amplifier in the 1940-1955 period, usually in the driver stages of power amps.  The designer of the famous [[Williamson amplifier]], one of the first true [[high-fidelity]] designs, suggested use of the 6SN7 (or B65) in his 1949 revision since it was similar to the original circuit's '''L63''' (=6J5) British single triodes, four of which were used in each channel of his 1947 circuit.

The 6SN7 was one of the most important components of the first programmable digital computer, the [[ENIAC]], which contained several thousand. The [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] computer systems used hundreds of 5692s as [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s.

With the advent of television the 6SN7 was well suited for use as a vertical-deflection amplifier.  As screen sizes became larger, voltage and power headroom became insufficient.  To address this, uprated versions  with higher peak voltage and power ratings were introduced. The '''GE 6SN7GTA''' (GE, 1950) had [[anode]] dissipation uprated to 5.0 watts. The 1954 GE 6SN7GTB also had  controlled heater warmup time, better for [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] heater strings.

The 6SN7 was considered to be obsolete by the 1960s, replaced by the [[12AU7]], and became almost unobtainable. With the introduction of [[semiconductor electronics]], vacuum tubes of all types ceased to be manufactured by the major producers.

A small demand for vacuum tubes in [[guitar amplifier]]s and very expensive high-fidelity equipment remained; as existing stocks ran out, factories in eastern Europe and China started to manufacture the 6SN7, and higher-gain '''6SL7'''.  {{As of|2012}}, 6SN7s were manufactured in Russia and China under the old Soviet designator '''6N8S'''.

It had been known since the middle of the 19th century that gas flames were [[Electrical conduction|electrically conductive]], and early wireless experimenters had noticed that this conductivity was affected by the presence of [[Radio frequency|radio waves]]. De Forest found that gas in a partial [[vacuum]] heated by a conventional lamp filament behaved much the same way, and that if a wire were wrapped around the glass housing, the device could serve as a detector of radio signals. In his original design, a small metal plate was sealed into the lamp housing, and this was connected to the positive terminal of a 22 volt battery via a pair of headphones, the negative terminal being connected to one side of the lamp filament. When wireless signals were applied to the wire wrapped around the outside of the glass, they caused disturbances in the current which produced sounds in the headphones.

This was a significant development as existing commercial wireless systems were heavily protected by [[patent]]s; a new type of detector would allow De Forest to market his own system. He eventually discovered that connecting the antenna circuit to a third electrode placed directly in the current path greatly improved the sensitivity; in his earliest versions, this was simply a piece of wire bent into the shape of a grid-iron (hence &quot;grid&quot;).

Compared to all competing devices at the time, the Audion was unique in that it did not draw significant power from antenna/tuned circuit, which allowed the tuning circuitry to operate with maximum selectivity. With virtually all other systems, all of the power to operate the headphones had to come from the antenna circuit itself, which tended to &quot;damp&quot; the tuned circuits, limiting their ability to separate stations (distinguish discrete frequencies).

=== Patents and disputes ===
Arguments still continue about whether De Forest really invented the triode vacuum tube. What is apparent is that he (and everybody else at the time) greatly underestimated the potential of his original device, imagining it to be limited to mostly military applications. It is significant that he apparently never saw its potential as a [[long distance calling|telephone repeater amplifier]], even though crude electromechanical ''note magnifiers'' had been the bane of the telephone industry for at least two decades. (Ironically, in the years of patent disputes leading up to WWI, it was only this &quot;loophole&quot; that allowed vacuum triodes to be manufactured at all, since none of De Forest's patents specifically mentioned this application).

De Forest was granted a patent for his early two-electrode version of the Audion on November 13, 1906 ({{US patent|841386}}), but the &quot;triode&quot; (three electrode) version was patented in 1908 ({{US patent|879532}}). De Forest continued to claim that he developed the Audion independently from [[John Ambrose Fleming]]'s earlier research on the [[thermionic valve]] (for which he received Great Britain patent 24850 and the American [[Fleming valve]] patent ({{US patent|803684}}), and became embroiled in many radio-related patent disputes. De Forest was famous for saying that he &quot;didn't know why it worked, it just did&quot;.

He  always referred to the vacuum triodes developed by other researchers as &quot;Oscillaudions&quot;, although there is no evidence that he had any significant input to their development. It is true that after the invention of the true vacuum triode in 1913 (see below), de Forrest continued to manufacture various types of radio transmitting and receiving apparatus, (examples of which are illustrated on this page). However, although he routinely described these devices as using &quot;Audions&quot;, they actually used high-vacuum triodes, using circuitry very similar to that developed by other experimenters.

In 1914, [[Columbia University]] student [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] worked with professor [[John Harold Morecroft]] to document the electrical principles of the Audion. Armstrong published his explanation of the Audion in ''[[Electrical World]]'' in December 1914, complete with circuit diagrams and oscilloscope graphs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong-audion&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The problem was that (possibly to distance his invention from the Fleming valve) De Forest's original patents specified that low-pressure gas inside the Audion was essential to its operation (Audion being a contraction of &quot;Audio-Ion&quot;), and in fact early Audions had severe reliability problems due to this gas being adsorbed by the metal electrodes. The Audions sometimes worked extremely well; at other times they would barely work at all.

As well as De Forest himself, numerous researchers had tried to find ways to improve the reliability  of the device by stabilizing the partial vacuum. Much of the research that led to the development of true vacuum tubes was carried out by Irving Langmuir in the [[General Electric]] (GE) research laboratories.

===Kenotron and Pliotron===

Langmuir had long suspected that certain assumed  limitations on the performance of various low-pressure and vacuum electrical devices, might not be fundamental physical limitations at all, but simply due to contamination and impurities in the manufacturing process.

His first success was in demonstrating that, contrary to what Edison and others had long asserted, incandescent lamps could function more efficiently and with longer life if the glass envelope was filled with low-pressure inert gas rather than a complete vacuum. However, this only worked if the gas used was meticulously 'scrubbed&quot; of all traces of oxygen and water vapor.
He then applied the same approach to producing a rectifier for the newly developed &quot;Coolidge&quot; X-ray tubes. Again contrary to what had been widely believed to be possible, by virtue of meticulous cleanliness and attention to detail, he was able to produce versions of the Fleming Diode that could rectify hundreds of thousands of volts. His rectifiers were called &quot;Kenotrons&quot; from the Greek ''keno'' (empty, contains nothing, as in a vacuum) and ''tron'' (device, instrument).

He then turned his attention to the Audion tube, again suspecting that its notoriously unpredictable behaviour might be tamed with more care in the manufacturing process.

However he took a somewhat unorthodox approach. Instead of trying to stabilize the partial vacuum, he wondered if it was possible to make the Audion function with the total vacuum of a Kenotron, since that was somewhat easier to stabilize.

He soon realized that his &quot;vacuum&quot; Audion had markedly different characteristics from the De Forest version, and was really a quite different device, capable of linear amplification and at much higher frequencies.  To distinguish his device from the Audion he named it the &quot;Pliotron&quot;, from the Greek ''plio'' (more or extra, in this sense meaning [[gain (electronics)|gain]], more signal coming out than went in).

Essentially, he referred to all his vacuum tube designs as Kenotrons, the Pliotron basically being a specialized type of Kenotron. However, because Pliotron and Kenotron were registered trademarks, technical writers tended to use the more generic term &quot;vacuum tube&quot;. By the mid-1920s, the term &quot;Kenotron&quot; had come to exclusively refer to vacuum tube rectifiers, while the term &quot;Pliotron&quot; had fallen into disuse. Ironically, in popular usage, the sound-alike brands &quot;Radiotron&quot; and &quot;Ken-Rad&quot; outlasted the original names.

One of the major weaknesses of De Forest's claims was that true vacuum triodes simply ''will not work'' if there is any trace of gas left in the envelope. In fact, before vacuum tubes could become commercially viable, quite elaborate techniques had to be developed to both initially evacuate the tubes and soak up any gas molecules that subsequently found their way in. This flies directly in the face of his original patent specification, which specifically states that gas is essential to the operation of the Audion.

Another weakness is that none of his Audion schematics denoted the provision for any sort of &quot;grid bias&quot;, an essential feature of any true vacuum triode operation.

Unlike the Audion, the vacuum triode could not [[Demodulation|demodulate]] radio signals directly (although Langmuir and other researchers soon found alternative ways to do this), but it was capable of linear (i.e. undistorted) amplification, which turned out to be a vastly more useful feature. It is ironic that many &quot;faulty&quot; Audions, which had lost their ability to demodulate radio signals due to gas absorption, had actually turned into crude linear amplifiers (which was why they lost their demodulating ability), but nobody realized this at the time.

== Applications and use ==

[[Image:De Forest Audion AM radio transmitters.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Some of the earliest Audion AM radio transmitters, built by De Forest around 1916.

[[Image:Audion vacuum tube advertisement.png|thumb|Audion advertisement, ''Electrical Experimenter'' magazine, 1916]]

De Forest continued  to manufacture and supply Audions to the US Navy up until the early 1920s, for maintenance of existing equipment, but elsewhere they were regarded as well and truly obsolete by then. It was the vacuum [[triode]] that made practical radio broadcasts a reality.

Prior to the introduction of the Audion, radio receivers had used a variety of [[detector (radio)|detector]]s including [[coherer]]s, [[barretter detector|barretter]]s, and [[crystal detector]]s.  The most popular crystal detector consisted of a small piece of [[galena]] crystal probed by a fine wire commonly referred to as a &quot;[[cat's-whisker detector]]&quot;. They were very unreliable, requiring frequent adjustment of the cat's whisker and offered no amplification. Such systems usually required the user to listen to the signal through headphones, sometimes at very low volume, as the only energy available to operate the headphones was that picked up by the antenna. For long distance communication huge antennas were normally required, and enormous amounts of electrical power had to be fed into the transmitter.

The Audion was a considerable improvement on this, but the original devices could not provide any subsequent amplification to what was produced in the signal detection process. The later vacuum triodes allowed the signal to be amplified to any desired level, typically by feeding the amplified output of one triode into the grid of the next, eventually providing more than enough power to drive a full-sized speaker. Apart from this, they were able to amplify the incoming radio signals prior to the detection process, making it work much more efficiently.

Vacuum tubes could also be used to make superior [[radio transmitter]]s. The combination of much more efficient transmitters and much more sensitive receivers revolutionized radio communication during [[World War I]].

By the late 1920s such &quot;tube radios&quot; began to become a fixture of most [[Western world]] households, and remained so until the introduction of [[transistor]] radios in the mid-1950s.

In modern [[electronics]], the [[vacuum tube]] has been largely superseded by [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices such as the [[transistor]], invented in 1947 and implemented in [[integrated circuit]]s in 1959, although vacuum tubes remain to this day in such applications as high-powered transmitters, guitar amplifiers and some high fidelity audio equipment.

[[File:5651RegulatorTubeInOperation.jpg|thumb|upright|5651 Regulator tube in operation]]

A '''voltage-regulator tube''' ('''VR tube''') is an [[Electronics|electronic]] component used as a [[voltage regulator#Shunt regulators|shunt regulator]] to hold a [[voltage]] constant at a pre-determined level.

Physically, these devices resemble [[vacuum tube]]s, but there are two main differences:
* Their glass envelopes are filled with a [[gas]] mixture, and
* They have a [[cold cathode]]; the [[cathode]] is not heated with a [[electrical filament|filament]] to emit electrons.

Electrically, these devices resemble [[Zener diode]]s, with the following major differences:
* They rely on gas [[ionization]], rather than [[Zener breakdown]]
* The unregulated supply voltage must be 15–20% above the nominal output voltage to ensure that the discharge starts
* The output can be higher than nominal if the current through the tube is too low.
When sufficient voltage is applied across the electrodes, the gas [[ionize]]s, forming a [[electric glow discharge|glow discharge]] around the [[cathode]] electrode. The VR tube then acts as a [[negative resistance]] device; as the [[electric current|current]] through the device increases, the amount of ionization also increases, reducing the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the device to further current flow. In this way, the device conducts sufficient current to hold the voltage across its terminals to the desired value.

Because the device would conduct a nearly unlimited amount of current, there must be some external means of limiting the current. Usually, this is provided by an external [[resistor]] upstream from the VR tube. The VR tube then conducts any portion of the current that does not flow into the downstream load, maintaining an approximately constant voltage across the VR tube's electrodes. The VR tube's regulation voltage was only guaranteed when conducting an amount of current within the allowable range.  In particular, if the current through the tube is too low to maintain ionization, the output voltage can rise above the nominal output—as far as the input supply voltage.  If the current through the tube is too high, it can enter an [[Electric arc|arc discharge]] mode where the voltage will be significantly lower than nominal and the tube may be damaged.

Some voltage-regulator tubes contained small amounts of [[radionuclide]]s to produce a more reliable ionization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/consumer%20products/electrontubes.htm Electron Tubes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Corona discharge|''Corona'']] VR tube is a high-voltage version that's [[hydrogen]]-filled at close to atmospheric pressure, for voltages ranging from 400&amp;nbsp;V to 30&amp;nbsp;kV at tens of microamperes. It has a [[coaxial]] form; the outer cylindrical electrode is the cathode and the inner one is the anode. The voltage stability depends on the gas pressure.

== Specific models ==
In America, VR tubes were given [[RETMA tube designation|RETMA tube part numbers]]. Lacking a heater (filament), the tube's part numbers began with &quot;[[List of vacuum tubes#&quot;0 volt&quot; gas-filled cold cathode tubes|0]]&quot; (zero).

In Europe, VR tubes were given part numbers under the [[List of vacuum tubes#Professional tubes|professional system]] (&quot;[[List of vacuum tubes#ZZ|ZZ1xxx]]&quot;) and under a [[List of vacuum tubes#Voltage stabilizers|dedicated system]].

In USSR, glow-discharge stabilitrons were given designation in Cyrillic with serial number of development.&lt;ref name=&quot;lec4&quot;&gt;{{ru icon}} http://library.tuit.uz/skanir_knigi/book/baz.lek.elektronike/baz.lek.po.elek2.htm Lection 4 of [[Tashkent University of Information Technologies]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, &quot;СГ21Б&quot;, &quot;СГ204К&quot; and i.e.&lt;ref name=&quot;lec4&quot;/&gt;

VR tubes were only available in certain voltages. Common models were:

Octal-based tubes, 5–40 [[ampere|mA]] current:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.junkbox.com/electronics/sheets/GE_Glow_Tubes_ETI-176.pdf General Electric Glow Tubes]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 0A3 – 75 volts
* 0B3 – 90 volts
* 0C3 – 105 volts (best regulation of these four)
* 0D3 – 150 volts

Miniature tubes, 5–30 mA current:
* 0A2 – 150 volts
* 0B2 – 108 volts (best regulation of these three)
* 0C2 – 72 volts
Miniature tubes, 1–10 mA current:
*85A2 – 85 volts(equivalents:CV449,0G3,CV4048,QS1209,QS83/3 )

Voltage reference 1.5–3.0 mA current:
* 5651 – 87 volts (the most popular voltage reference ever made)
* 5651-a &amp;ndash; 85.5 volts

Subminiature tubes:
* Various models that resembled [[neon lamp]]s, but were optimized for more-accurate voltage regulation

==Design considerations ==
The pinout of VR tubes was designed so that power could be forced to flow &quot;through&quot; the VR tubes to the load. That is, the load current would flow in one pin of the VR tube and out through a second pin. In this way, the circuit could be arranged so that unplugging the VR tube would disconnect the load. (Otherwise, unplugging the VR tube would have allowed the voltage to become unregulated, possibly rising as high as the source voltage and damaging the downstream load.)

Because the glow discharge is a &quot;statistical&quot; process, a certain amount of electrical noise is introduced into the regulated voltage as the level of ionization varies. In most cases, this could be easily filtered out by placing a small [[capacitor]] in parallel with the VR tube or using an RC decoupling network downstream of the VR tube. Too large a capacitance (&gt;0.1μF for an 0D3, for instance), however, and the circuit will form a [[relaxation oscillator]], definitely ruining the voltage regulation and possibly causing the tube to fail catastrophically.

VR tubes could be operated in [[series circuit|series]] for greater voltage ranges. They could not be operated in [[parallel circuit|parallel]]: because of manufacturing variations, the current would not be shared equally among several tubes in parallel. (Note the equivalent behavior with series and parallel connected Zener diodes.)

Presently, VR tubes have been almost-entirely supplanted by [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] regulators based on [[Zener diode]]s and [[avalanche diode|avalanche breakdown diode]]s.

==VR tube information==
Correctly operating VR tubes glow during normal operation. The color of the glow varies depending upon the gas mixture used to fill the tubes.

Though they lack a heater, VR tubes often do become warm during operation due to the current and voltage drop through them.

[[File:BPT Pinout.png|thumb|right|The 6V6 pinout, metal versions had the shell connected to Pin 1]]

The '''6V6''' is a [[beam-power]] [[tetrode]], introduced as the '''6V6G''' by Ken-Rad Tube &amp; Lamp Corporation in late 1936,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Engineering/30s/1936/Radio-Engineering-1936-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; it is still in use in audio applications, especially electric guitar amplifiers. Following the introduction in July 1936 of the [[6L6]], the potential of the scaled down version that became the 6V6 was soon realized. The lower-powered 6V6 was better suited for average home use, and became common in the audio output stages of &quot;farmhouse&quot; table-top [[radio]]s, where power pentodes such as the [[6F6]] had previously been used. The 6V6 required less heater power and produced less distortion than the 6F6, while yielding higher output in both single-ended and [[Push-pull output|push-pull]] configurations. Although the 6V6 was originally designed especially for use in automobile radios,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Today/30s/Radio-Today-1936-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the clip-in Loctal base '''7C5''',&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/201/7/7C5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; from early 1939, or the lower heater current '''12V6GT''', both with the identical characteristics to the 6V6, but with the smaller T-9 glass envelope, soon became the tubes of choice for many automotive radios manufacturers. Additionally, the 6V6 had applications the portable radio market.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The data sheet information supplied by the tube manufacturers design centers, list the typical operation of an audio output stage for a single 6V6 as producing about 5W of continuous power, and a push-pull pair about 14W. Amplifier manufacturers soon realized that the tube was capable of being used at ratings above the recommended maximums, and guitar amplifiers with 400V on the plates of a pair of 6V6GTA claim to produce an output power of 20W RMS at 5%THD with 40W Peak Music Power, and with 490V on the plates, as much as 30W RMS.

==History==
[[File:6V6s.JPG|thumb|right|Various 6V6's manufactured around the world; from left to right – 6V6GTA by General Electric, 6V6GT JAN National Union (1940s), 6P6S (USSR, 1978) and modern production 6V6GT by Electro-Harmonix.]]
Following the 6V6G, RMA Release #96 – 09 Nov. 1936, sponsored by Ken-Rad Tube &amp; Lamp Corporation, with the ST shouldered glass envelope, the 6V6 was announced with a metal mantel in January 1937 by Hygrade Sylvania.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Today/30s/Radio-Today-1937-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The RMA Release #125 – 03 Jan.1938, Sponsored by RCA. for the 6V6 tube has led to some confusion as to the origins of the 6V6. The 6V6G but not the 6V6 is in the RCA manual RC-13 from July 1937. Tube manufacturers were promoting the superiority of metal tube designs in the second half of the 1930s, and this tube, having been introduced during that period, was produced in large quantities in this format. The introduction of the 6V6GT, RMA Release #201 – 10 July 1939, was sponsored by Hytron Corporation. By 1940, the 6V6 was mostly being produced in this smaller &quot;GT&quot; T-9 glass envelope.&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/049/6/6V6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The '''6V6GTA''' – RMA Release #1681 – 2 July 1956, sponsored by Hygrade Sylvania Corporation, has a controlled warm-up period.&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/049/6/6V6GTA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current use==
Generally speaking, 6V6 tubes are sturdy and can be operated beyond their published specifications (the 6P6S, which has poor tolerance for out-of-spec operation versus most American and West European-made 6V6 variants, is an exception).&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/113/6/6P6S.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the 6V6 became very popular for use in consumer-market musical [[instrument amplifier]]s, particularly combo-style guitar amps such as the [http://myfenderchamp.com/2009/11/11/tweed-fender-champ-power-tube-6v6gt/tweed Fender Champ], the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] GA-40, and the [[Fender Princeton Reverb]], and [[Fender Deluxe Reverb]] amps, which run a push-pull pair of 6V6s at 410V-plus on the plates. This market allows [[China|Chinese]], [[Slovakia]]n and [[Russia]]n tube factories to keep the 6V6 in production to this day. Because of the relative similarity in voltage and characteristics between the 6V6 and the popular [[EL84]]/6BQ5 power [[pentode]] tube, several electronics and musical instrument companies have developed adapters to allow an amplifier with 6V6 octal sockets to accept the miniature noval pinned EL84 tube. However, no reverse adapter, that is to allow a mini-noval EL84 socket to accept a 6V6, has been developed.

A '''triode''' is an electronic [[amplifier|amplifying]] [[vacuum tube]] (or ''valve'' in British English) consisting of three [[electrode]]s inside an evacuated glass envelope: a heated [[Electrical filament|filament]] or [[cathode]], a [[control grid|grid]], and a [[Plate electrode|plate]] ([[anode]]). Invented in 1906 by [[Lee De Forest]] by adding a grid to the [[Fleming valve]], the triode was the first [[electronic amplifier|electronic amplification]] device and the ancestor of other types of vacuum tubes such as the [[tetrode]] and [[pentode]].  Its invention founded the [[electronics]] age, making possible amplified [[radio technology]] and long-distance [[telephony]]. Triodes were widely used in [[consumer electronics]] devices such as radios and televisions until the 1970s, when [[transistor]]s replaced them. Today, their main remaining use is in high-power [[Radio frequency|RF]] amplifiers in [[Transmitter|radio transmitters]] and industrial RF heating devices. The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] τρίοδος, ''tríodos'', from ''tri-'' (three) and ''hodós'' (road, way), originally meaning the place where three roads meet.

== History ==

The first vacuum tube, the [[diode]] or [[Fleming valve]], which had two electrodes, a filament and a plate (anode), was invented by [[John Ambrose Fleming]] in 1904 as a [[radio receiver]] [[detector (radio)|detector]].   The first three-element tube, a mercury-vapor-filled tube with a control grid, was patented on March 4, 1906, by the Austrian [[Robert von Lieben]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hts-homepage.de/Lieben/Lieben.html] DRP 179807&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tapan K. Sarkar (ed.) &quot;History of wireless&quot;, John Wiley and Sons, 2006.

Independently, beginning in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?locale=de_EP&amp;CC=US&amp;NR=841387] Patent US841387 from 10/25/1906&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=6i1vAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 879,532]&lt;/ref&gt; American engineer [[Lee De Forest]] invented a number of three-element tube designs by adding an electrode to the diode, which he called [[Audion]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Forest&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

By 1913 improved versions with higher vacuum were developed by Harold Arnold at [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] which had purchased the rights to the Audion from De Forest,  and [[Irving Langmuir]] at [[General Electric]], who named his tube the &quot;Pliotron&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nebeker&quot; /&gt;  These were the first [[vacuum tube]] triodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Okamura&quot; /&gt;  The name triode appeared later, when it became necessary to distinguish it from other kinds of vacuum tubes with more or fewer elements (e.g. [[diode]]s, [[tetrode]]s, [[pentode]]s, etc.).  There were lengthy lawsuits between De Forest and von Lieben, and De Forest and the [[Marconi Company]], representing [[John Ambrose Fleming]] who invented the diode.

[[Image:Triode tube 1906.jpg|right|thumb|Lee De Forest Audion tube from 1908, the first triode.  The flat plate is visible at top, with the zigzag wire grid under it. The filament was originally under the grid but has burned out.   The Audion was incompletely evacuated and ionization of residual gas in it caused it to function somewhat differently from the later thermionic &quot;hard vacuum&quot; triodes.]]

The discovery of the triode's amplifying ability in 1912 revolutionized electrical technology, creating the new field of ''[[electronics]]'', the technology of [[passivity (engineering)|active]] ([[amplifier|amplifying]]) electrical devices. The triode was immediately applied to many areas of communication. Triode &quot;[[continuous wave]]&quot; [[transmitter|radio transmitters]] replaced the cumbersome inefficient &quot;[[damped wave]]&quot; [[spark gap transmitter]]s, allowing the transmission of sound by [[amplitude modulation]] (AM). Amplifying triode [[radio receiver]]s, which had the power to drive [[loudspeaker]]s, replaced weak [[crystal radio]]s, which had to be listened to with [[earphones]], allowing families to listen together. This resulted in the evolution of radio from a commercial message service to the first [[mass communication]] medium, with the beginning of [[radio broadcasting]] around 1920.  Triodes made transcontinental telephone service possible. Vacuum tube triode [[repeater]]s, invented at [[AT&amp;T|Bell Telephone]] after its purchase of the Audion rights, allowed telephone calls to travel beyond the unamplified limit of about 800 miles. The opening by Bell of the first transcontinental telephone line was celebrated 3 years later, on January 25, 1915.  Other inventions made possible by the triode were [[television]], [[public address system]]s, electric [[phonograph]]s, and [[talking motion picture]]s.

The triode served as the technological base from which later vacuum tubes developed, such as the [[tetrode]] ([[Walter Schottky]], 1916) and [[pentode]] (Bernardus Tellegen, 1926), which remedied some of the shortcomings of the triode detailed below.

The triode was very widely used in [[consumer electronic]]s such as radios, televisions, and [[audio system]]s until it was replaced in the 1960s by the [[transistor]], invented in 1947, which brought the &quot;vacuum tube&quot; era started by the triode to a close.  Today triodes are mostly used in high-power applications for which solid state [[semiconductor device]]s are unsuitable, such as radio transmitters and industrial heating equipment. However, more recently the triode and other vacuum tube devices have been experiencing a resurgence and comeback in high fidelity audio and musical equipment.

== Construction ==
[[Image:Triode-english-text.svg|right|thumb|Structure of a modern low-power triode vacuum tube.  The glass and outer electrodes are shown partly cut away to reveal the construction.]]
[[File:Triode schematic labeled.svg|thumb|[[Schematic symbol]] used in [[circuit diagram]]s for a triode, showing symbols for electrodes.]]

All triodes have a hot [[cathode]] electrode heated by a [[electrical filament|filament]], which releases electrons, and a flat metal [[plate electrode|plate]] electrode to which the electrons are attracted, with a [[Control grid|grid]] consisting of a screen of wires between them to control the current.  These are sealed inside a glass container from which the air has been removed to a high vacuum, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; atm.  Since the filament eventually burns out, the tube has a limited lifetime and is made as a replaceable unit; the electrodes are attached to terminal pins which plug into a socket.  The operating lifetime of a triode is about 2000 hours for small tubes and 10,000 hours for power tubes.

=== Low power triodes ===
Low power triodes have a concentric construction ''(see drawing right)'', with the grid and plate as circular or oval cylinders surrounding the cathode.   The [[cathode]] is a narrow metal tube down the center.  Inside it is a [[electrical filament|filament]] called the &quot;heater&quot; consisting of a narrow strip of high resistance [[tungsten]] wire, which heats the cathode red-hot (800 - 1000 °C).  This type is called an &quot;[[Hot cathode|indirectly heated cathode]]&quot;  The cathode is coated with a mixture of [[alkaline earth]] oxides such as calcium and [[thorium oxide]] which reduces its [[work function]] so it produces more electrons.  The grid is constructed of a helix or screen of thin wires surrounding the cathode.  The plate is a cylinder or rectangular box of sheet metal surrounding the grid.  It is blackened to radiate heat and is often equipped with heat-radiating fins.   The electrons travel in a radial direction, from the cathode through the grid wires to the plate.   The elements are held in position by mica or ceramic [[electrical insulator|insulators]] and are supported by stiff wires attached to the base, where the electrodes are brought out to connecting pins.    A &quot;[[getter]]&quot;, a small amount of shiny [[barium]] metal evaporated onto the inside of the glass, helps maintain the vacuum by absorbing gas released in the tube over time.

=== High-power triodes ===
High-power triodes generally use a [[electrical filament|filament]] which serves as the cathode (a directly heated cathode) because the emission coating on [[Hot cathode|indirectly heated cathodes]]  is destroyed by the higher ion bombardment in power tubes.  A [[thoriated tungsten]] filament is most often used, in which [[thorium]] in the tungsten forms a monolayer on the surface which increases electron emission.  These generally run at higher temperatures than indirectly heated cathodes.  The envelope of the tube is often made of more durable ceramic rather than glass, and all the materials have higher melting points to withstand higher heat levels produced.    Tubes with plate power dissipation over about 350 W must be actively cooled.  The plate electrode, made of heavy copper, projects through the wall of the tube and is attached to a large external finned metal [[heat sink]] which is cooled by forced air or water.

=== Lighthouse tubes ===
[[Image:Scheib3.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse tube]]
A type of low power triode for use at high ([[Ultrahigh frequency|UHF]]) frequencies, the &quot;lighthouse&quot; tube has a planar construction to reduce interelectrode [[capacitance]] and lead [[inductance]], which gives it the appearance of a &quot;lighthouse&quot;.  The disk-shaped cathode, grid and plate form planes up the center of the tube - a little like a sandwich with spaces between the layers.  The cathode at the bottom is attached to the tube's pins, but the grid and plate are brought out to low inductance terminals on the upper level of the tube: the grid to a metal ring halfway up, and the plate to a metal button at the top. These are one example of &quot;disk seal&quot; design. Smaller examples dispense with the octal pin base shown in the illustration and rely on contact rings for all connections, including heater and D.C. cathode.

As well, high-frequency performance is limited by transit time: the time required for electrons to travel from cathode to anode. Transit time effects are complicated, but one simple effect is input conductance, also known as grid loading. At extreme high frequencies, electrons arriving at the grid may become out of phase with those departing towards the anode. This imbalance of charge causes the grid to exhibit a reactance that is much less than its low-frequency &quot;open circuit&quot; characteristic.

Transit time effects are reduced by reduced spacings in the tube. Tubes such as the 416B (a Lighthouse design) and the 7768 (an all-ceramic miniaturised design) are specified for operation to 4 GHz. They feature greatly reduced grid-cathode spacings in the order of 0.1 mm. 

These greatly reduced grid spacings also give a much higher amplification factor than conventional axial designs. The 7768 has an amplification factor of 225, compared with 100 for the 6AV6 used in domestic radios and about the maximum possible for an axial design.

Anode-grid capacitance is not especially low in these designs. The 6AV6 anode-grid capacitance is 2 picofarads (pF), the 7768 has a value of 1.7 pF. The close electrode spacing used in microwave tubes ''increases'' capacitances, but this increase is offset by their overall reduced dimensions compared to lower-frequency tubes.

In the triode, [[electron]]s are released into the tube from the metal [[cathode]] by heating it, a process called [[thermionic emission]].  The cathode is heated red hot by a separate current flowing through a thin metal [[electrical filament|filament]].   In a few triodes, the filament itself is the cathode, while in most the filament heats a separate cathode electrode.  Virtually all the air is removed from the tube, so the electrons can move freely.   The negative electrons are attracted to the positively charged [[plate electrode|plate]] (anode), and flow through the spaces between the grid wires to it, creating a current through the tube from cathode to plate.

The magnitude of this current can be controlled by a voltage applied between the cathode and the grid. The grid acts like a gate for the electrons.   A more negative voltage on the grid will repel some of the electrons, so fewer get through to the plate, reducing the plate current.  A positive voltage on the grid will attract more electrons from the cathode, so more reach the plate, increasing the plate current. Therefore, a low power varying (AC) signal applied to the grid can control a much more powerful plate current, resulting in [[amplifier|amplification]]. Variation in the grid voltage will cause identical proportional variations in the plate current.  By placing a suitable load resistance in the plate circuit, the varying current will cause a varying voltage across the resistance which can be much larger than the input voltage variations, resulting in [[voltage gain]].

The triode is a normally &quot;on&quot; device; and current flows to the plate with zero voltage on the grid.  The plate current is progressively reduced as the grid is made more negative with respect to the cathode.   Usually a constant DC voltage (&quot;bias&quot;) is applied to the grid to set the DC current through the tube, and the varying signal voltage is superimposed on it.   A sufficiently negative voltage on the grid, usually around 3-5 volts in small tubes such as the 6AV6, but as much as –130 volts in early audio power devices such as the '45, will prevent any electrons from getting through to the plate, turning off the plate current.   This is called the &quot;cutoff voltage&quot;. Since below cutoff the plate current ceases to respond to the grid voltage, the voltage on the grid must remain above the cutoff voltage for faithful (linear) amplification.

The triode is very similar in operation to the n-channel [[JFET]]; it is normally on, and progressively switched off as the grid/gate is pulled increasingly negative of the source/cathode. Cutoff voltage is equivalent to the JFET's pinch-off voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)or VGS(off); the point at which current stops flowing entirely.

== Applications ==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}
Although S.G. Brown's Type G Telephone Relay (using a magnetic &quot;earphone&quot; mechanism driving a carbon microphone element) was able to give power amplification and had been in use as early as 1914, it was a purely mechanical device with limited frequency range and fidelity. It was suited only to a limited range of audio frequencies - essentially voice frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;Tyne, Gerald F.J., Saga of the Vacuum Tube, 1977, Howard W. Sams, pp 201~202&lt;/ref&gt;

The triode was the first non-mechanical device to provide power gain at audio and radio frequencies, and made [[radio]] practical. Triodes are used for amplifiers and oscillators. Many types are used only at low to moderate frequency and power levels. Large water-cooled triodes may be used as the final amplifier in radio transmitters, with ratings of thousands of watts. Specialized types of triode (&quot;lighthouse&quot; tubes, with low capacitance between elements) provide useful gain at microwave frequencies.

Vacuum tubes are obsolete in mass-marketed [[consumer electronics]], having been overtaken by less expensive transistor-based [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] devices. However, more recently, vacuum tubes have been making somewhat of a comeback. Triodes increasingly continue to be used in certain performance sensitive areas such as [[high-end audio|high-end]] and [[professional audio]] applications, as well as in microphone [[preamplifier]]s, electric [[guitar amplifier]]s, and high-power [[Radio frequency|RF]] amplifiers and [[transmitter]]s.

== Characteristics ==
[[Image:TriodeECC83Characteristic1.png|right|ECC83 triode operating characteristic.|thumb]]
In triode datasheets, characteristics linking the anode current(I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) to anode voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) and grid voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) are usually given. From here, a circuit designer can choose the [[Biasing|operating point]] of the particular triode.

In the example characteristic shown on the image, if an anode voltage V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of 200 V and a grid [[voltage bias]] of -1 volt are selected, a plate (anode) current of 2.25 mA will be present (using the yellow curve on the graph). Changing the grid voltage will change the plate current; by suitable choice of a plate load resistor, amplification is obtained.

In the [[Class-A amplifier|class-A]] triode amplifier, an anode resistor would be connected between the anode and the positive voltage source. For example, with R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=10000 Ohms, the voltage drop on it would be

V&lt;sub&gt;Ra&lt;/sub&gt;=I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;times;R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=22.5 V if an anode current of I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=2.25 mA is chosen.

If the input voltage amplitude (at the grid) changes from -1.5 V to -0.5 V (difference of 1 V), the anode current will change from 1.2 to 3.3 mA (see image). This will change the resistor voltage drop from 12 to 33 V (a difference of 21 V).

Since the grid voltage changes from -1.5 V to -0.5 V, and the anode resistor voltage drops from 12 to 33 V, an amplification of the signal resulted. The amplification factor is 21 - output voltage amplitude divided by input voltage amplitude.

[[File:Egun.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Electron gun from a [[cathode ray tube]]]]
[[File:Kathodestraalbuis2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Electron gun from an [[oscilloscope]] CRT]]
An '''electron gun''' (also called '''electron emitter''') is an electrical component in some [[vacuum tube]]s that produces a narrow, [[collimation|collimated]] [[electron beam]] that has a precise [[kinetic energy]].  The largest use is in [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs), used in nearly all [[television set]]s, [[computer display]]s and [[oscilloscope]]s that are not flat-panel displays. They are also used in FED displays, which are essentially flat-panel displays made out of rows extremely small cathode ray tubes. They are also used in microwave linear beam [[vacuum tube]]s such as [[klystron]]s, [[inductive output tube]]s, [[travelling wave tube]]s, and [[gyrotron]]s, as well as in scientific instruments such as [[electron microscope]]s and [[particle accelerators]].
Electron guns may be classified by the type of electric field generation (DC or RF), by emission mechanism ([[thermionic emission|thermionic]],  [[photocathode]], [[field electron emission|cold emission]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] source), by focusing (pure electrostatic or with magnetic fields), or by the number of electrodes.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Electron Gun with Wehnelt Cylinder.svg|thumb|250px|right|Setup of an electron gun with:&lt;br /&gt;

➁ [[Wehnelt cylinder]]&lt;br /&gt;
➂ Anode
]]
[[Image:Ekanoner.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Electron gun from a [[travelling wave tube]], cutaway through axis to show construction]]
A direct current, electrostatic thermionic electron gun is formed from several parts: a [[hot cathode]], which is heated to create a stream of [[electrons]] via [[thermionic emission]], electrodes generating an [[electric field]] which focus the beam (such as a [[Wehnelt cylinder]]), and one or more [[anode]] electrodes which accelerate and further focus the electrons. A large voltage between the cathode and anode accelerates the electrons. A repulsive ring placed between them focuses the electrons onto a small spot on the anode at the expense of a lower extraction field strength on the cathode surface. Often at this spot is a hole so that the electrons that pass through the anode form a collimated beam and finally reach a second anode called a collector. This arrangement is similar to an [[Einzel lens]].

Most color [[cathode ray tubes]] – such as those used in [[color television]]s – incorporate three electron guns, each one producing a different stream of electrons. Each stream travels through a [[shadow mask]] where the electrons will impinge upon either a [[RGB colour model|red, green or blue]] [[phosphor]] to light up a color [[pixel]] on the screen. The resultant color that is seen by the viewer will be a combination of these three [[primary color]]s.

==Applications==
The most common use of electron guns is in [[cathode ray tube]]s, which were widely used in computer and television monitors. An [[electron]] gun can also be used to [[ionize]] particles by adding or removing electrons from an [[atom]]. This technology is sometimes used in [[mass spectrometry]] in a process called [[electron ionization]] to ionize [[vaporized]] or [[gaseous]] particles. More powerful electron guns are used for welding, metal coating, 3D metal printers, metal powder production and vacuum furnaces.

==Measurement and detection==
A [[nanocoulombmeter]] in combination with a [[Faraday cup]] can be used
to detect and measure the beams emitted from [[electron gun]] and [[ion gun]]s.

Another way to detect electron beams from an electron gun is by using a [[phosphor]] screen
which will glow when struck by an electron.

A '''pentode''' is an electronic device having five active [[electrode]]s. The term most commonly applies to a three-grid amplifying [[vacuum tube]] (thermionic valve), which was invented by [[Gilles Holst]] and [[Bernard Tellegen|Bernhard D.H. Tellegen]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;G. Holst and B.D.H. Tellegen, &quot;Means for amplifying electrical oscillations&quot;, US Patent 1945040, January 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pentode consists of an evacuated glass envelope containing five electrodes in this order: a ''[[cathode]]'' heated by a [[electrical filament|filament]], a ''[[control grid]]'', a ''[[screen grid]]'', a ''[[suppressor grid]]'', and a ''[[plate electrode|plate]]'' ([[anode]]). The pentode (called a &quot;triple-grid amplifier&quot; in some early literature&lt;ref&gt;&quot;RCA Receiving Tube Manual, 1940&quot;; p118&lt;/ref&gt;) was developed from the [[tetrode]] tube by the addition of a third grid, the suppressor grid. This served to prevent [[secondary emission]] electrons emitted by the plate from reaching the screen grid, which caused instability and [[parasitic oscillation]]s in the tetrode.  The pentode is closely related to the [[beam tetrode]].  Pentodes were widely used in industrial and consumer electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s, when they were replaced by transistors.  Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters.  The obsolete consumer tubes are still used in a few legacy and specialty vacuum tube audio devices.

== Types of pentodes ==
* '''Variable transconductance''' (&quot;'''variable-mu'''&quot;, &quot;'''remote-cutoff'''&quot; or &quot;'''super-control'''&quot;) tubes in general are those with a non-uniform grid wire spacing to allow them to handle a wide range of input signal levels without excessive cross-modulation [[distortion]], and so useful in [[radio frequency]] stages where [[automatic gain control]] is applied to the pentode. The first commercial variable-mu tubes were the 550 and 551 developed by Stuart and Snow around 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, B &amp; Snow, H. A. (1930). Reduction of Distortion and Cross-Talk in Radio Receivers by Mean of Variable-Mu Tetrodes. Proc IRE, Vol 18, Issue 12, pp2102 - 2127&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples include: [[EF50]], 1T4, 6K7, 6BA6, and the EF83 (while perhaps the EF85/6BY7, and certainly the 6JH6, could be described as &quot;'''semiremote-cutoff'''&quot; pentodes).
* '''Sharp-cutoff''' (&quot;high slope&quot; or ordinary) pentodes have the more ordinary uniform spacing of grid wires, and so mutual conductance decreases in an essentially uniform manner with increasing negative bias, and has a more abrupt cutoff. These pentodes are more suitable for audio amplifiers. Examples include: EF37A, [[EF86]]/6267, 1N5GT, 6AU6A, 6J7GT. Often, but not always, in the [[Mullard-Philips tube designation|European valve naming scheme]] for pentodes an even number indicated a sharp-cutoff device while odd indicated remote-cutoff; the EF37 was an exception to this general trend, perhaps due to its history as an update to the EF36 ([http://www.r-type.org/addtext/add008.htm &quot;The Mullard EF36, EF37 and EF37A&quot; at the National Valve Museum]).
* '''Power output pentodes''', The [[EL34]], [[EL84]], 6CL6, 6F6, 6G6, [[SY4307A]] and 6K6GT are some examples of true pentodes used for power amplification, using a suppressor grid rather than the higher efficiency beam-forming plates used in beam tetrodes. (Beam tetrodes were also sometimes referred to as &quot;beam pentodes&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sylvania Receiving Tubes Technical Manual, 14th Edition&quot; p 143&lt;/ref&gt; and include the Sylvania (and possibly GE) 6CA7 version of EL34, 6V6GT and the GEC KT66 and KT88. Other sources perferred names such as &quot;beam power amplifier&quot; or &quot;beam power tube&quot;, possibly due to caution regarding the [[Philips]] pentode patent). Power output pentodes for specific television requirements, efficient for their job but possibly not linear enough for audio, were named:
** '''video output''' pentodes, e.g. 15A6/PL83, PL802
** '''frame output''' or '''vertical deflection''' pentodes, such as the [[EL84#PL84, UL84 and EL86|PL84]] and the pentode sections of the 18GV8/PCL85.
** '''line output''' or '''horizontal deflection''' pentodes, such as the PL36, 27GB5/PL500, PL505 etc.

* A &quot;triode-pentode&quot; is a single envelope containing both a triode and a pentode, such as an ECF80 or ECL86.

== Advantages over the tetrode ==
The simple [[tetrode]] tube -also called a 'straight tetrode'- offered a larger amplification factor, more power and a higher frequency capability than the earlier [[triode]].  However, in the tetrode the anode may emit more ''[[secondary emission|secondary electrons]]'' than it receives (the excess being collected by the nearby screen grid). Secondary electrons are those knocked out of the [[anode]] when the electrons from the cathode strike it. The result is a reversal of net anode current.  In other words, the anode current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is found to ''decrease'' with increasing anode voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, over part of the characteristic curve.  This [[negative anode resistance]] (Δ''V''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/Δ''I''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0) can cause the tetrode to become unstable, leading to oscillation in some circumstances.

The pentode, as introduced by [[Bernard_D._H._Tellegen| Tellegen]], has an additional electrode, or third grid, called the [[suppressor grid]], located between the screen grid and the anode, which solves the problem of secondary emission.   The suppressor grid is given a low potential, it is usually either grounded or connected to the cathode.  Secondary emission electrons from the anode are repelled by the negative potential on the suppressor grid, so they can't reach the screen grid but return to the anode.  The primary electrons from the cathode have a higher kinetic energy, so they can still pass through the suppressor grid and reach the anode.  

Pentodes, therefore, can have higher current outputs and a wider output voltage swing; the anode/plate can even be at a lower voltage than the screen grid yet still amplify well.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;RCA Receiving Tube Manual, 1940&quot;; p8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparisons with the triode ==
[[File:Kt88pent.gif|thumb|right|Example pentode current/voltage characteristics for differing control grid voltages.]]
* Pentodes (and tetrodes) tend to have a much lower feedback capacitance, due to the screening effect of the second grid.  
* Pentodes tend to have a higher noise (''partition noise''), 
* Triodes have a lower internal anode resistance, and hence higher damping factor when used in audio output circuits, compared with pentodes, when [[negative feedback]] is absent.  That also reduces the potential voltage amplification obtainable from a triode compared with a pentode of the same transconductance, and usually means a more efficient output stage can be made using pentodes, with a lower power drive signal.
* Pentodes are almost unaffected by changes in supply voltage, and can thus operate with more poorly stabilized supplies than triodes. An examination of the characteristics shown here will show that the plate current hardly changes as plate voltage varies.
* Pentodes and triodes (and tetrodes) do have essentially similar relationships between grid (one) input voltage and anode output current when the anode voltage is held constant, i.e. close to a [[Power-law#square-law|square-law]] relationship.

== Usage ==
[[Image:12AE10CompactronTube.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[General Electric]] 12AE10 double pentode]]
Pentode tubes were first used in consumer-type radio receivers. A well-known pentode type, the [[EF50]], was designed before the start of World War II, and was extensively used in [[radar]] sets and other military electronic equipment. The pentode contributed to the electronic preponderance of the Allies.

The [[Colossus computer]] and the [[Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine]] used huge numbers of EF36 pentode tubes.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, pentodes were widely used in TV receivers, particularly the successor to the EF50, the EF80. Vacuum tubes were replaced by transistors during the 1960s. However, they continue to be used in certain applications, including high-power radio transmitters and (because of their well-known [[valve sound]]) in [[high-end audio|high-end]] and [[professional audio]] applications, microphone [[preamplifier]]s and electric [[guitar amplifier]]s. Large stockpiles in countries of the former Soviet Union have provided a continuing supply of such devices, some designed for other purposes but adapted to audio use, such as the [[GU-50]] transmitter tube.

== Triode-strapped pentode circuits ==
A pentode can have its screen grid (grid 2) connected to the anode (plate), in which case it reverts to an ordinary triode with commensurate characteristics (lower anode resistance, lower mu, lower noise, more drive voltage required). The device is then said to be &quot;triode-strapped&quot; or &quot;triode-connected&quot;. This is sometimes provided as an option in [[audiophile]] pentode amplifier circuits, to give the sought-after &quot;sonic qualities&quot; of a triode power amplifier.  A resistor may be included in series with the screen grid to avoid exceeding the screen grid's power or voltage rating, and to prevent local oscillation. Triode-connection is a useful option for audiophiles who wish to avoid the expense of 'true' power triodes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4565">[[Image:Tektronix 4014.jpg|right|frame|Tektronix 4014 with a &quot;DVBST&quot; storage display screen]]
'''Direct-view bistable storage tube''' ('''DVBST''') was an acronym used by [[Tektronix]] to describe their line of [[Storage_tube|storage tubes]]. These were [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRT) that stored information written to them using an [[Oscilloscope#Analog storage oscilloscope|analog technique]] inherent in the CRT and based upon the [[secondary emission]] of electrons from the phosphor screen itself. The resulting image was visible in the continuously glowing patterns on the face of the CRT.

DVBST technology was anticipated by Andrew Haeff of the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|US Naval Research Laboratory]], and by Williams and Kilburn in the late 1940s.  Tek's (Tektronix) Robert H. Anderson refined Haeff's concepts in the late 1950s to produce a reliable and simple DVST.

==Principle==
The DVBST implements two [[electron gun]]s: a &quot;flood gun&quot; and a &quot;writing gun&quot;. The writing gun scans across a wire grid, charging the grid to create the negative image.  The flood gun then floods the grid.  Previously charged areas repel the incoming electrons so that electrons only pass through the grid to the phosphor in those areas not previously charged.

The technology offered several advantages and disadvantages.

===Advantages===
* No refreshing is needed. 
* Very complex pictures can be displayed at very high resolution without flicker. 

===Disadvantages===
* They ordinarily do not display color.
* Selected part of the picture can not be erased.
* The erasing and redrawing process can take several seconds for complex pictures.
* no animation in DVST.
* modifying any part of image need to modify require redrawing of entire image.

==Applications==
Tektronix-made DVBSTs were used for analog oscilloscopes (first in the 564 oscilloscope, then the type 601 monitor (1968), the 611 monitor, the 7613 plug-in mainframe oscilloscope, all from Tektronix) and for computer terminals such as the archetypal Tek 4010 and its several successors including the [[Tektronix 4014]]. Portions of the screen are individually written-to by a conventional electron beam gun, and &quot;flooded&quot; by a wide, low velocity electron gun. Erasure required erasing the entire screen in a bright flash of green light, leading to the nickname &quot;the mean green flashin' machine&quot;.

Some DVBST implementations also allowed the &quot;write-through&quot; of a small amount of dynamically refreshed, non-stored data. This allowed the display of [[cursor (computers)|cursor]]s, graphic elements under construction, and the like on computer terminals.

== Skiatron ==
Another version of a (non-Tekronix) DVBST was the &quot;dark trace&quot; CRT, also known as the '''Skiatron'''. This CRT replaced the conventional light-emitting ''[[phosphor]]'' layer on the face of the tube screen with a ''[[scotophor]]'' such as [[potassium chloride]] (KCl). KCl has the property that when a crystal is struck by an [[electron beam]], that spot would change from translucent white to a dark [[magenta]] color. By [[backlight]]ing such a CRT with a white or green circular [[fluorescent lamp]], the resulting image would appear as black information against a green background or as magenta information against a white background. A benefit, aside from the semi-permanent storage of the displayed image, is that the brightness of the resultant display is only limited by the illumination source and optics.

The image would be retained until erased by flooding the scotophor with a high-intensity [[infrared light]] or by electro-thermal heating. Using conventional deflection and [[raster scan|raster]] formation circuity, a bi-level image could be created on the membrane and retained even when power was removed from the CRT. By using an array of dots, say 8 &amp;times; 8, a larger pixel could be formed to represent 64 gray levels. One such device, the D36 Image Display, was made by [[DICOMED]] Corporation and a technical paper was presented at the 1972 Electro-Optical Conference in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].

The '''Williams tube''', or the '''Williams–Kilburn tube''' after inventors [[Frederic Calland Williams|Freddie Williams]] and [[Tom Kilburn]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computer50.org/mark1/notes.html#acousticdelay Why Williams-Kilburn Tube is a Better Name for the Williams Tube
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kilburn | first = Tom | author-link = Tom Kilburn | title = From Cathode Ray Tube to Ferranti Mark I | journal = Resurrection | publisher = The Computer Conservation Society | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | year = 1990 | url = http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res02.htm#e | issn = 0958-7403 | accessdate = 15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed in 1946 and 1947, was a [[cathode ray tube]] used as a [[computer memory]] to electronically store [[binary data]].

It was the first [[Random-access memory|random-access]] digital storage device,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Early computers at Manchester University |journal=Resurrection |volume=1 |issue=4 |publisher=The Computer Conservation Society |date=Summer 1992 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g |issn=0958-7403 |accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used successfully in several early computers.

Williams and Kilburn applied for British patents on Dec. 11, 1946&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikipatents.com/GB-Patent-645691/improvements-in-or-relating-to-electrical-information-storing-means GB Patent 645,691]&lt;/ref&gt; and Oct. 2, 1947,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikipatents.com/GB-Patent-657591/improvements-in-or-relating-to-electrical-storage-apparatus GB Patent 657,591]&lt;/ref&gt; followed by US patent applications on  Dec. 10, 1947 ({{US patent|2951176}}) and  May 16, 1949 ({{US patent|2777971}}).

==Working principle==
The Williams tube depends on an effect called [[secondary emission]]. When a dot is drawn on a cathode ray tube by a beam of fast-moving electrons, the area of the dot becomes slightly positively charged and the area immediately around it becomes slightly negatively charged, creating a [[Potential well|charge well]]. The charge well remains on the surface of the tube for a fraction of a second, allowing the device to act as a computer memory. The lifetime of the charge well depends on the [[electrical resistance]] of the inside of the tube.

The dot can be erased by drawing a second dot immediately next to the first one, thus filling the charge well. Most systems did this by drawing a short [[dash]] starting at the dot position, so that the extension of the dash erased the charge initially stored at the starting point.

Information is read from the tube by means of a metal pickup plate that covers the face of the tube. Each time a dot is created or erased, the change in electrical charge induces a voltage pulse in the pickup plate. Since this operation is synchronised with whichever location on the screen is being targeted at that moment, it effectively reads the data stored there. Because the electron beam is essentially inertia-free, and thus can be steered from location to location very quickly, there is no practical restriction in the order of positions so accessed, hence the so-called ″random-access″ nature of the lookup.

Reading a memory location creates a new charge well, destroying the original contents of that location, and so any read has to be followed by a write to reinstate the original data. Since the charge gradually leaked away, it was necessary to scan the tube periodically and rewrite every dot (similar to the [[memory refresh]] cycles of [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] in modern systems).

Some Williams tubes were made from [[radar]]-type cathode ray tubes with a [[phosphor]] coating that made the data visible, while other tubes were purpose-built without such a coating. The presence or absence of this coating had no effect on the operation of the tube, and was of no importance to the operators since the face of the tube was covered by the pickup plate. If a visible output was needed, a second tube connected in parallel with the storage tube, with a phosphor coating but without a pickup plate, was used as a display device.

Each Williams tube could store about 1024–2560 [[bit]]s of data.

==Development==
Developed at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in England, it provided the medium on which the first electronically stored-memory program was implemented in the [[Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine]] (SSEM) computer, which first successfully ran a program on 21 June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Napper | first = Brian | title = Computer 50: The University of Manchester Celebrates the Birth of the Modern Computer | url = http://www.computer50.org/ | accessdate = 26 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, rather than the Williams tube memory being designed for the SSEM, the SSEM was a [[testbed]] to demonstrate the reliability of the memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Williams|first1=F.C.|last2=Kilburn|first2=T.|title=Electronic Digital Computers|journal=Nature|volume=162|pages=487|date=Sep 1948|doi=10.1038/162487a0|issue=4117|postscript=.}} Reprinted in ''The Origins of Digital Computers''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Williams|first1=F.C.|last2=Kilburn|first2=T.|last3=Tootill|first3=G.C.|title=Universal High-Speed Digital Computers: A Small-Scale Experimental Machine|url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/ssem.html|journal=Proc.

Tradition at the university has it that this was the only program Kilburn ever wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lavington|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Williams tube tended to become unreliable with age, and most working installations had to be &quot;tuned&quot; by hand. By contrast, mercury [[delay line memory]] was slower and not truly random access, as the bits were presented serially, which complicated programming. Delay lines also needed hand tuning, but did not age as badly and enjoyed some success in early digital electronic computing despite their data rate, weight, cost, thermal and toxicity problems.  However, the [[Manchester Mark 1]], which used Williams tubes, was successfully commercialised as the [[Ferranti Mark 1]]. Some early computers in the USA also used the Williams tube, including the [[IAS machine]] (originally designed for [[Selectron tube]] memory), the [[UNIVAC 1103]], [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]], [[IBM 701]], [[IBM 702]] and the [[SWAC (computer)|Standards Western Automatic Computer]] (SWAC). Williams tubes were also used in the Soviet [[Strela computer|Strela-1]] and in the Japan TAC (Tokyo Automatic Computer).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5904">[[File:Triode schematic labeled.svg|thumb|[[Schematic symbol]] used in [[circuit diagram]]s for a vacuum tube, showing control grid]]

The '''control grid''' is an [[electrode]] used in amplifying [[vacuum tube|thermionic valves]] (vacuum tubes) such as the [[triode]], [[tetrode]] and [[pentode]], used to control the flow of electrons from the [[cathode]] to the [[plate electrode|anode]] (plate) electrode.  The control grid usually consists of a cylindrical screen or helix of fine wire surrounding the cathode, and is surrounded in turn by the anode.  The control grid was invented by [[Lee De Forest]], who in 1906  added a grid to the [[Fleming valve]] ([[thermionic diode]]) to create the first [[amplifier|amplifying]] vacuum tube, the [[Audion]] ([[triode]]).

== Operation ==
In a valve, the hot cathode emits negatively charged [[electron]]s, which are attracted to and captured by the anode, which is given a positive voltage by a power supply.  The control grid functions as a &quot;gate&quot; to control the current of electrons reaching the anode.  A more negative voltage on the grid will repel the electrons back toward the cathode so fewer get through to the anode.  A less negative, or positive, voltage on the grid will allow more electrons through, increasing the anode current.  A given change in grid voltage causes a proportional opposite change in plate current, so if a time-varying voltage is applied to the grid, the plate current waveform will be a copy of the applied grid voltage. 

A relatively small variation in voltage on the control grid causes a significantly large variation in anode current.  The presence of a resistor in the anode circuit causes a large variation in voltage to appear at the anode.  The variation in anode voltage can be much larger than the variation in grid voltage which caused it, and thus the tube can amplify, functioning as an [[amplifier]].

== Construction ==
[[Image:Triode-english-text.svg|right|thumb|Structure of a modern low-power triode vacuum tube.  The glass and outer electrodes are shown partly cut away to reveal the construction.  ]]

The grid in the first triode valve consisted of a zig-zag piece of wire placed between the filament and the anode.  This quickly evolved into a helical grid placed between a single strand filament (or later, a cylindrical cathode) and a cylindrical anode. The grid is usually made of a very thin wire that can resist high temperatures and is not prone to emitting electrons itself.  [[Molybdenum]] [[alloy]] with a [[gold]] plating is frequently used.  It is wound on soft [[copper]] sideposts, which are swaged over the grid windings to hold them in place.  A 1950s variation is the frame grid, which winds very fine wire onto a rigid stamped metal frame. This allows the holding of very close tolerances, so the grid can be placed closer to the filament (or cathode).

== Effects of grid position ==

By placing the control grid closer to the filament/cathode relative to the anode, a greater [[amplifier|amplification]] results.  This degree of amplification is referred to in valve data sheets as the [[amplification factor]].  It also results in higher [[transconductance]], which is a measure of the anode current change versus grid voltage change.  The [[noise figure]] of a valve is inversely proportional to its transconductance; higher transconductance generally means lower noise figure.  Lower noise can be very important when designing a radio or television receiver.

== Multiple control grids ==

A valve can contain more than one control grid.  The [[hexode]] contains two such grids, one for a received signal and one for the signal from a local oscillator.  The valve's inherent non-linearity causes not only both original signals to appear in the anode circuit, but also the sum and difference of those signals.  This can be exploited as a frequency-changer in [[superheterodyne]] receivers.

== Grid variations ==

A variation of the control grid is to produce the helix with a variable pitch.  This gives the resultant valve a distinct non-linear characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpub.com/content/neets/14178/css/14178_74.htm Variable mu valves]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often exploited in R.F. amplifiers where an alteration of the [[grid bias]] changes the mutual conductance and hence the gain of the device.  This variation usually appears in the [[pentode]] form of the valve, where it is then called a variable-mu pentode or remote-cutoff pentode.

One of the principal limitations of the triode valve is that there is considerable capacitance between the grid and the anode (Cag). A phenomenon known as the [[Miller Effect]] causes the input capacitance of an amplifier to be the product of Cag and amplification factor of the valve.  This, and the instability of an amplifier with tuned input and output when Cag is large can severely limit the upper operating frequency.  These effects can be overcome by the addition of a [[screen grid]], however in the later years of the tube era, constructional techniques were developed that rendered this 'parasitic capacitance' so low that triodes operating in the upper [[very high frequency]] (VHF) bands became possible.  The [[Mullard]] [[EC91]] operated at up to 250 MHz. The anode-grid capacitiance of the EC91 is quoted in manufacturer's literature as 2.5 pF, which is higher than many other triodes of the era, while many triodes of the 1920s had figures which are strictly comparable, so there was no advance in this area.  However, early screen-grid tetrodes of the 1920s, have Cag of only 1 or 2fF, around a thousand times less. 'Modern' pentodes have comparable values of Cag. Triodes were used in VHF amplifiers in 'grounded-grid' configuration, a circuit arrangement which prevents Miller feedback.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13466">'''Space charge''' is a concept in which excess [[electric charge]] is treated as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] of charge distributed over a region of space (either a volume or an area) rather than distinct point-like charges. This model typically applies when [[charge carriers]] have been emitted from some region of a solid—the cloud of emitted carriers can form a space charge region if they are sufficiently spread out, or the charged atoms or molecules left behind in the solid can form a space charge region. Space charge usually only occurs in [[dielectric]] media (including [[vacuum]]) because in a conductive medium the charge tends to be rapidly neutralized or [[Electric field screening|screened]]. The sign of the space charge can be either negative or positive. This situation is perhaps most familiar in the area near a [[metal]] object when it is heated to [[incandescence]] in a [[vacuum]]. This effect was first observed by [[Thomas Edison]] in light bulb [[Electrical filament|filament]]s, where it is sometimes called the [[Edison effect]], but space charge is a significant phenomenon in many vacuum and [[solid-state electronic]] devices.

==Cause==

===Physical explanation===
When a metal object is placed in a vacuum and is heated to incandescence, the energy is sufficient to cause [[electron]]s to &quot;boil&quot; away from the surface [[atom]]s and surround the metal object in a cloud of [[free electron]]s. This is called [[thermionic emission]]. The resulting cloud is negatively charged, and can be attracted to any nearby positively charged object, thus producing an electric current which passes through the vacuum.

Space charge can result from a range of phenomena, but the most important are:

# Combination of the current density and spatially inhomogeneous resistance
# Ionization of species within the dielectric to form heterocharge
# Charge injection from electrodes and from a stress enhancement
# Polarization in structures such as [[Electrical treeing|water tree]]s.  &quot;Water tree&quot; is a name given to a tree-like figure appearing in a water-impregnated polymer insulating cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that in [[alternating current]] (AC) most carriers injected at electrodes during a half of cycle are ejected during the next half cycle, so the net balance of charge on a cycle is practically zero. However, a small fraction of the carriers can be trapped at levels deep enough to retain them when the field is inverted. The amount of charge in AC should increase slower than in [[direct current]] (DC) and become observable after longer periods of time.

==== Hetero and Homo Charge ====
Hetero charge means that the polarity of the space charge is 
opposite to that of neighboring electrode, and homo charge is the reverse situation.  
Under high voltage application, a hetero charge near the electrode is expected to reduce the 
breakdown voltage, whereas a homo charge will increase it. After polarity reversal under ac 
conditions, the homo charge is converted to hetero space charge.

===Mathematical explanation===
If the &quot;[[vacuum]]&quot; has a [[pressure]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; mmHg or less, the main [[vehicle]] of conduction is [[electron]]s. The emission current density ''(J'') from the [[cathode]], as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of its thermodynamic [[temperature]] ''T'', in the absence of space-charge, is given by [[Richardson's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;J = (1-\tilde{r})A_0T^2\exp\left(\frac{-\phi}{kT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;A_0 = \frac{4\pi e m_e k^2}{h^3} \approx 1.2 \times 10^5&lt;/math&gt;  A m&lt;sup&gt;−2 &lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
:''e'' = elementary positive charge (i.e., magnitude of electron charge),
:''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = electron mass,
:''k'' = [[Boltzmann's constant]] = 1.38 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt;J/K,
:''h'' = [[Planck's constant]] = 6.62 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; J s,
:''&amp;phi;'' = [[work function]] of the cathode,
:''ř'' = mean electron reflection coefficient.

The reflection coefficient can be as low as 0.105 but is usually near 0.5. For [[Tungsten]], (1 - ř)A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.6 to 1.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; A m&lt;sup&gt;−2 &lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''&amp;phi;'' = 4.52 eV. At 2500&amp;nbsp;°C, the emission is 3000 A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The emission current as given above is many times greater than that normally collected by the electrodes, except in some [[pulse]]d [[valves]] such as the [[cavity magnetron]]. Most of the electrons emitted by the cathode are driven back to it by the [[Coulomb's law|repulsion]] of the [[cloud]] of electrons in its neighborhood. This is called the ''space charge effect''. In the limit of large current densities, ''J'' is given by the Child-Langmuir equation below, rather than by the thermionic emission equation above.

==Occurrence==
Space charge is an inherent property of all [[vacuum tube]]s. This has at times made life harder or easier for [[electrical engineer]]s who used tubes in their designs. For example, space charge significantly limited the practical application of [[triode]] [[amplifier]]s which led to further innovations such as the vacuum tube [[tetrode]].

On the other hand, space charge was useful in some tube applications because it generates a negative [[Electromotive force|EMF]] within the tube's envelope, which could be used to create a negative bias on the tube's grid. Grid bias could also be achieved by using an applied grid voltage in addition to the control voltage. This could improve the engineer's control and fidelity of amplification. It allowed to construct ''space charge tubes'' for [[Vehicle audio|car radios]] that required only 6 or 12 volts anode voltage (typical examples were the 6DR8/EBF83, 6GM8/ECC86, 6DS8/ECH83, 6ES6/EF97 and 6ET6/EF98).

Space charges can also occur within [[dielectric]]s. For example, when gas near a high voltage electrode begins to undergo [[dielectric breakdown]], electrical charges are injected into the region near the electrode, forming space charge regions in the surrounding gas. Space charges can also occur within solid or liquid dielectrics that are stressed by high [[electric fields]]. Trapped space charges within solid dielectrics are often a contributing factor leading to dielectric failure within high voltage power cables and capacitors.

== Child's Law ==
[[Image:ChildLangmuirLawGraph1.png|Graph showing Child-Langmuir Law. S and d are constant and equal to 1.|thumb]]

First proposed by [[Clement D. Child]] in 1911, Child's Law states that the space-charge limited current (SCLC) in a plane-parallel vacuum diode varies directly as the three-halves power of the anode voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and inversely as the square of the distance ''d'' separating the cathode and the anode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Child |first=C. D. |authorlink=Clement D. Child |title=Discharge From Hot CaO |journal=Physical Review | series = Series I |date=1 May 1911 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=492–511 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevSeriesI.32.492 |bibcode = 1911PhRvI..32..492C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For electrons, the current density ''J'' (amperes per meter squared) is written:
:&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{ I_a }{ S } =\frac{4 \epsilon_0}{9}\sqrt{2 e / m_e} \frac{V_a^{3/2}}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is the anode current and ''S'' the anode surface inner area; &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the charge of the electron and &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is its mass. The equation is also known as the &quot;Three-halves Power&quot; Law and as the Child–Langmuir Law. Child originally derived this equation for the case of atomic ions, which have much smaller ratios of their charge to their mass. [[Irving Langmuir]] published the application to electron currents in 1913, and extended it to the case of cylindrical cathodes and anodes.

The equation's validity is subject to the following assumptions:
# Electrons travel ballistically between electrodes (i.e., no scattering).
# In the interelectrode region, the space charge of any ions is negligible.
# The electrons have zero velocity at the cathode surface.

The assumption of no scattering (ballistic transport) is what makes the predictions of Child–Langmuir Law different from those of Mott–Gurney Law. The latter assumes steady-state drift transport and therefore strong scattering.

== Mott–Gurney law ==&lt;!--'Mott–Gurney law' redirects here--&gt;
In semiconductors and insulating materials, an electric field causes charged particles like electrons to reach a specific &quot;drift velocity&quot; that is parallel to the direction of the field. It is different from the behavior of the free charged particles in a vacuum, in which a field accelerates the particle. The proportionality factor between the magnitudes of the drift-velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and the electric field &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[electron mobility|mobility]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \mu \mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;

The Child's Law behavior of a space charge limited current that applies in a vacuum diode doesn't generally apply in a solid, and is replaced by the Mott-Gurney form. For a thin slab of material of thickness &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, the electric current density &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; flowing through the slab is:
:&lt;math&gt;J=\frac{9{\epsilon}{\mu}{V_a}^{2}}{8{L}^3}&lt;/math&gt; ,
where &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage that has been applied across the slab and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dielectric constant]] of the solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mott |first1=Nevill F. |last2=Gurney |first2=R. W. |title=Electronic Processes in Ionic Crystals, 1st ed. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murgatroyd |first=P. N. J. |journal=Phys. D: Appl. Phys. |title=Theory of space-charge-limited current enhanced by Frenkel effect |year=1970 |volume=3 |page=151 |doi=10.1088/0022-3727/3/2/308|bibcode = 1970JPhD....3..151M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the velocity-saturation regime, this equation takes the following form
:&lt;math&gt;J=\frac{2{\epsilon}{v}{V_a}}{{L}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Note the different dependence of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; in each of the two cases.  Interestingly, in the ballistic case (assuming no collisions), the Mott-Gurney equation takes the form of the more familiar Child-Langmuir law.

It should be noted that the above derivations make the following assumptions:
# There is only one type of charge carrier present.
# The material has no intrinsic conductivity, but charges are injected into it from one electrode and captured by the other.
# The carrier mobility &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and the dielectric permittivity &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; are constant throughout the sample.
# The electric field at the charge-injecting cathode is zero.

As an application example, the steady-state space-charge-limited current across a piece of silicon with a charge carrier mobility of 1500&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V-s, a dielectric constant of 11.9, an area of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a thickness of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;cm can be calculated by an [http://www.popproperty.net/PopularTools/Semiconductor/SpaceChargeLimited.aspx on line calculator] as 126.4mA at voltage 3V.

== Shot noise ==
Space charge tends to reduce [[shot noise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Terman |first=Frederick Emmons |authorlink=Frederick Terman |title=Radio Engineers' Handbook |edition=first |year=1943 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=286&amp;ndash;294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shot noise results from the random arrivals of discrete charge; the statistical variation in the arrivals produces shot noise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terman292-3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Terman|1943|pp=292&amp;ndash;293}}&lt;/ref&gt; A space charge develops a potential that slows the carriers down. For example, an electron approaching a cloud of other electrons will slow down due to the repulsive force. The slowing carriers also increases the space charge density and resulting potential. In addition, the potential developed by the space charge can reduce the number of carriers emitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Terman|1943|pp=286&amp;ndash;287}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the space charge limits the current, the random arrivals of the carriers are smoothed out; the reduced variation results in less shot noise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terman292-3&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2040">The '''1L6''' is a 7 pin miniature [[vacuum tube]] of the [[pentagrid converter]] type. It was developed in the [[USA]] by [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]]. It is very similar electrically to its predecessors, the Loktal based 1LA6 and 1LC6. Released in 1949 for the [[Zenith Trans-Oceanic]] shortwave portable radio, this tube was in commercial production until the early 1960s .  

The 1L6 was to be a specialty tube, produced in small quantities by very few manufacturers, mostly Sylvania for use by just a few manufacturers of shortwave portables, such  as Zenith - in their Trans-Oceanics - and its short-lived rivals, such as the [[Hallicrafters]] TW-1000 and the [[RCA]] Strat-O-World and  very few others. In fact, Zenith, Crosley and more than a few others used it in many radios. 1L6 based multi-band radios were made by Crosley, Airline (Montgomery Ward house-brand), Silvertone (Sears house brand), Hallicrafters, FADA, and several others. When the US military commissioned two versions of the Trans-Oceanics, they stockpiled 1L6s in their uncounted thousands, some of which still show up at surplus sales. 

It was offered to Zenith by Sylvania in place of the larger 1LA6 - for which Zenith made production line changes as the first Miniature-Tube T/O was starting production. The original G500 chassis was punched for a Locktal socket, Zenith changed the phenolic wafer socket to accommodate the smaller tube. NOTE: a 1LA6 (or a 1LC6) will work as a near drop-in replacement for the 1L6 with the use of an adapter socket. 

The closet European analog to the 1L6 is the DK92. &lt;ref&gt;TransOceanic, the Royalty of Radios (Bryant and Cones) 2008 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mullard Limited''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] manufacturer of [[electronics|electronic]] components. The Mullard Radio Valve Co. Ltd. of [[Southfields]], London, was founded in 1920 by Captain [[Stanley R. Mullard]], who had previously designed valves for the Admiralty before becoming managing director of the Z Electric Lamp Co. The company soon moved to [[Hammersmith]], London and then in 1923 to [[Balham]], London. The head office in later years was Mullard House at 1-19 Torrington Place, [[Bloomsbury]], now part of [[University College London]].

==Partnership with Philips==
In 1923, in order to meet the technical demands of the newly formed [[BBC]], Mullard formed a partnership with the Dutch manufacturer [[Philips]].  The  [[vacuum tube|valves]] (US vacuum tube) produced in this period were named with the prefix PM, for Philips-Mullard, beginning with the PM3 and PM4 in 1926. Mullard finally sold all its shares to Philips in 1927. In 1928 the company introduced the first [[pentode]] valve to the British market.

==Factories==
===Mitcham===
Mullard opened a new manufacturing plant at [[Mitcham]], Surrey in 1929. A second building was added in 1936. Both buildings had a very distinctive flat roof construction and were very similar to those at Philips' headquarters in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]]. Co-sited with the Mullard buildings was the manufacturing complex for Philips Radios.  Mitcham was also home to the Mullard Application Laboratory.

===Blackburn===
In the late 1930s Mullard opened a new plant in [[Blackburn]], Lancashire. By 1949 Mullard had produced a number of [[television]] sets, such as the MTS-521 and MTS-684. In 1951 Mullard was producing the LSD series of photographic flash tubes.

===Others===
Mullard had factories in [[Southport]] and [[Simonstone, Lancashire|Simonstone]], near [[Padiham]] both in [[Lancashire]]. The latter closed in 2004. There was also a sister factory in [[Durham, England|Durham]]. Other factories included those at [[Fleetwood]] (closed in 1979) and [[Lytham St. Annes]] (closed in 1972). A feeder factory at [[Haydock]] closed in 1981.

==Teletext==
In the early 1980s, Mullard manufactured the [[SAA5050]], some of the earliest [[teletext]] decoding modules made in the UK.

==Semiconductors==
Mullard owned [[semiconductor]] factories in [[Southampton]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]]. Both sites were owned by [[NXP Semiconductors]] (formerly [[Philips Semiconductors]]). The Southampton site is now closed. The one in [[Hazel Grove]], Stockport specializes in [[power semiconductor device]]s.

The first [[transistor]]s produced by Mullard were the OC50 and OC51 point-contact types, which were not widely used. In 1953 Mullard moved to junction transistors, beginning with the plastic-cased OC10 series.  These were followed by the glass-encapsulated OC44/45, OC70 and OC80 series (the output devices were metal encapsulated to facilitate heatsinking), which were produced in large numbers and copied by other companies, such as [[Valvo]] (another Philips subsidiary), [[Intermetall]] and [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] in Germany, and [[Amperex]] in the USA. In 1964 the company produced a prototype electronic desktop [[calculator]] as a technology demonstrator for its transistors and [[cold cathode]] indicator tubes.

==Space science==
In 1957 Philips-Mullard helped to set up the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]] (MRAO) at the [[University of Cambridge]]. In 1966 the [[Mullard Space Science Laboratory]] (MSSL) was opened near [[Dorking]], [[Surrey]] as part of [[University College London]]. The [[Royal Society]] Mullard Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/funding.asp?id=4870 Mullard Award&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; for young scientists and engineers was set up in 1967.

==Mullard brand name==
Philips continued to use the brand name &quot;Mullard&quot; in the UK until 1988. Mullard Research Laboratories in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], [[Surrey]] then became Philips Research Laboratories. As of 2007, the Mullard brand has been revived by [[Sovtek]], producing a variant of the [[ECC83]] and [[EL34]].

==Z Electric Lamp Company==
The Z Electric Lamp Co. continued business into the 1970s operating from premises in [[Thornton Heath]], South London, manufacturing lamps of specialised design. However, it closed due to the recession in the mid 1970s.

The '''EL84''' is a [[vacuum tube|thermionic valve]] of the power [[pentode]] type. It has a 9 pin [[Noval base]] and is used mainly in the power output stages of audio amplification circuits, most commonly now in [[guitar amplifier]]s, but originally in radios and many other devices of the pre-[[transistor]] era. The EL84 is smaller and more sensitive than the octal [[6V6]] that was widely used around the world until the 1960s. An interchangeable North American type is the ''6BQ5'' (the [[RETMA tube designation]] name for the EL84).

It was developed to eliminate the need for a driver tube in radios, and has rather more gain than is usual in a power pentode, producing full output from a relatively small drive signal (the EL84 requires less than 4.4V&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; for 5.7W output compared with 9V&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; for 5.5W from a 6V6 or 8.7V&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; for 11W from an [[EL34]]). This eliminated the need for a [[preamplifier]] triode in radios, making them cheaper to produce. As the EL84 uses a 9 pin Noval construction, it was also cheap to produce and manufacturers were quick to adopt it in general use, and they are found in many old European valve radios and other audio equipment. A single EL84 was used in low-cost equipment, and a [[Push-pull output|push-pull]] pair for lower distortion and higher power.

In common with all 'E' prefix tubes, using the [[Mullard-Philips tube designation]], it has a heater voltage of 6.3V. It is capable, when used at its plate rating of 300 volts maximum, of producing 17 watts output in [[Electronic amplifier|Class AB1]] in [[Electronic amplifier|push-pull]] configuration. Many guitar amplifiers routinely run EL84 tubes in excess of 400VDC, with the Traynor Guitarmate reportedly putting out 25w RMS with 2 EL84's in a push pull configuration and a B+ between 400-420VDC.

Developed by [[Philips]] in 1953 for use in the British [[Mullard 5-10]] amplifier, the EL84 came to prominence when used in Watkins (and later the [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]]) amplifiers preferred by many [[British invasion]] bands of the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} When overdriven, the EL84 power tubes in these amplifiers produce a distinctive chiming, articulate, treble-heavy sound when compared to [[6L6]] tubes more commonly used in American amplifiers of the era such as those from [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== N709, 6BQ5/EL84, and other exact equivalents==
The 1959 &quot;Miniwatt&quot; Technical Data book from [[Philips]] lists the '''6BQ5''' as the [[RETMA tube designation|R.E.T.M.A.]] (American) name for the EL84 in its &quot;Type Number Cross Reference&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=&quot;Miniwatt&quot; Technical Data|date=1958|publisher=The &quot;Miniwatt&quot; Electronics Division of Philips Electrical Industries Pty. Limited|location=20 Herbert Street, Artarmon, N.S.W., Australia|page=158|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence an ''exact'' substitute. American and Japanese manufacturers might label their versions of the EL84 as &quot;'''EL84/6BQ5'''&quot; or &quot;'''6BQ5/EL84'''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sylvania Receiving Tubes Technical Manual|publisher=reprinted by Audio Amateur Press|page=124|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply &quot;6BQ5&quot; Other manufacturers followed with their versions, such as the '''N709''' from General Electric Co. Ltd. of England that were designed to be &quot;drop-in&quot; substitutes.  The '''CV2975''' is also equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A simple CV Register cross reference|url=http://www.nzvrs.pl.net/aaa/cv_register.htm|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other equivalent tubes are the '''7189''' and '''7189A''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7189A|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_7189a.html|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7189 &amp; 7189A Datasheets from Sylvania|url=http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/106/7/7189.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an extended-ratings version of the tube for industrial applications, '''E84L''' ('''7320''') long life, professional version with more than 10000 hours expected lifetime and the directly equivalent '''6P14P''' (Cyrillic: '''6П14П''') produced in the [[USSR]] by the Reflektor plant.  {{As of|2012}} a slightly modified version of the 6P14P was manufactured in Russia for [[Sovtek]].  An extended-ratings version of the 6P14P is also available - '''6P14P-EV''' (Cyrillic: '''6П14П-ЕВ''') and is known among US guitar players as &quot;'''EL84M'''&quot; or the &quot;Russian military EL84&quot;.  While not necessarily a true &quot;military version&quot; of the tube (in fact it is more comparable to the '''7189'''), 6P14P-EVs are known for their low noise and durability.  Large NOS (New Old Stock) supplies of the tube are available.
The '''6GK6''' has nearly equivalent operating characteristics with a different pinout.

{{As of|2012}} the tube was manufactured in [[Russia]] ([[Sovtek]] and [[Electro-Harmonix]] brands), [[Slovakia]]- [[Čadca]] (JJ Electronics), and [[Serbia]]- [[Niš]] (Ei).  The Sovtek EL84 is often sold under their own brand name by other well-known [[electric guitar]] and [[guitar amplifier]] manufacturers - such as [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] or [[Mesa Boogie]].

Also see [[6P1P]].

== PL84, UL84 and EL86 ==
Although [[RCA]] and Sylvania produced the '''8BQ5''' and '''10BQ5''' as exact equivalents to the '''6BQ5/EL84''' other than heater voltage/current, most variants of the EL84 (e.g. the '''15CW5/PL84''') for series-heater applications such as television receivers (where it was most economical to directly-rectify the mains) made slight changes to the geometry of the original EL84 design to optimise performance for the slightly lower power supply voltages. When a 6.3V heater version of the PL84 was needed, the type number '''EL86''' was assigned; the EL86 and PL84 are therefore very similar to, but ''not exactly identical'' to, the original EL84.

== Characteristics ==
Note: Specifications given for the EL84, PL84 and UL84 are from Philips;  [[RCA]] and [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] list slightly higher voltage ratings for Va and Vkf and lower for Vg2 for the xCW5 series - the 6CW5/EL86, 8CW5/XL86, 10CW5/LL86, 15CW5/PL84, and 30CW5/HL84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philips Data Handbook - Electron Tubes Part 4|date=1967|publisher=Philips}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EL86 @ The National Valve Museum|url=http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aad0122.htm|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mullard 5-10''' was a [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] for a [[valve amplifier]] designed by the British [[vacuum tube|valve]] company, [[Mullard]] in 1954 at the Mullard Applications Research Laboratory (ARL) in Mitcham Surrey UK, part of the New Road factory complex, to take advantage of their particular products. The circuit was first published in [[Practical Wireless]] magazine.

The amplifier featured five valves and an output of 10 watts - hence '5-10'. Of those valves, one was a [[full-wave rectifier]] (an EZ80 or EZ81), one was a pre-amplifier [[pentode]] [[EF86]] and one a double-triode [[12AX7|ECC83]] as [[phase splitter]]. The power amplification was handled by a pair of [[EL84]] working in [[Electronic amplifier|push-pull]] configuration.

The [[frequency response]] of the circuit was from 40Hz to 20,000Hz with less than 0.2% [[Total harmonic distortion|THD]]. 

In 1959 Mullard published its famous booklet &quot;[[Mullard Circuits for Audio Amplifiers]]&quot; covering a range of amplifier and pre-amplifier circuits using valves developed within the Receiving Valve Development Department at the New Road factory.

The circuit design of the Mullard 5-10, together with the recommended Partridge [[Transformer#Output transformer|output transformers]], was famous for its unique sound reproduction and many variations of this amplifier (including Mullard's own 20-watt version, the '''Mullard 5-20''' using the [[EL34]]) were in widespread use until the end of the valve era; similar designs are still manufactured as expensive equipment for valve audiophiles{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}.

[[File:Gase-in-Entladungsroehren.jpg|thumb|right|A set of cold cathode discharge tubes]]
A '''cold cathode'''&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1993187}}, Cold cathode discharge tube&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[cathode]] that is not electrically heated by a [[Electrical filament|filament]].&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;A negatively charged [[electrode]] emits [[electron]]s or is the positively charged terminal. For more, see [[field emission]].&lt;/ref&gt; A cathode may be considered &quot;cold&quot; if it emits more electrons than can be supplied by [[thermionic emission]] alone. It is used in [[Gas discharge lamp|gas-discharge lamps]], such as [[neon lamp]]s, [[discharge tube]]s, and some types of [[vacuum tube]]. The other type of cathode is a [[hot cathode]], which is heated by electric current passing through a [[Electrical filament|filament]]. A cold cathode does not necessarily operate at a low temperature: it is often heated to its [[operating temperature]] by other methods, such as the current passing from the cathode into the gas.

|}
A cold-cathode vacuum tube does not rely on external heating of an electrode to provide [[thermionic emission]] of electrons. Early cold-cathode devices included the [[Geissler tube]] and [[Julius Plücker|Plucker tube]], and early [[cathode ray tube]]s.  Study of the phenomena in these devices led to the discovery of the electron.

[[Neon lamp]]s are used both to produce light as indicators and for special-purpose illumination, and also as circuit elements displaying [[negative resistance]]. Addition of a trigger electrode to a device allowed the glow discharge to be initiated by an external control circuit; [[Bell Laboratories]] developed a &quot;trigger tube&quot; cold cathode device in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Neale, ''Cold Cathode Tube Circuit Design'', Francis and Taylor, 1964 pp. 1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Many types of cold-cathode switching tube were developed, including various types of [[thyratron]], the [[krytron]], cold cathode displays ([[Nixie tube]]) and others. [[Voltage regulator]] tubes rely on the relatively constant voltage of a [[glow discharge]] over a range of current, and were used to stabilize power supply voltages in tube-based instruments. A [[Dekatron]] is a cold-cathode tube with multiple electrodes that is used for counting.  Each time a pulse is applied to a control electrode, a glow discharge moves to a step electrode; by providing ten electrodes in each tube and cascading the tubes, a counter system can be developed and the count observed by the position of the glow discharges. Counter tubes were used widely before development of [[integrated circuit]] counter devices.

The [[flash tube]] is a cold-cathode device filled with [[xenon]] gas, used to produce an intense short pulse of light for photography or to act as a [[stroboscope]] to examine the motion of moving parts.

===Lamps===
Cold-cathode lamps include [[cold-cathode fluorescent lamp]]s ('''CCFLs''') and [[neon lamp]]s. Neon lamps primarily rely on excitation of gas molecules to emit light; CCFLs use a discharge in mercury vapor to develop ultraviolet light, which in turn causes a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] coating on the inside of the lamp to emit visible light.

Cold-cathode fluorescent lamps are used for [[backlight]]ing of [[LCD]]s, for example computer monitors and television screens.

In the lighting industry, “cold cathode” historically refers to luminous tubing which is larger than 20mm in diameter and operates on a current of 120 to 240 milliamps. This larger diameter tubing is often used for interior alcove and general lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ifay guide info electric discharge lighting systems, cold cathode| url =http://database.ul.com/cgi-bin/XYV/template/LISEXT/1FRAME/showpage.html?name=IFAY.GuideInfo&amp;ccnshorttitle=Electric+Discharge+Lighting+Systems,+Cold+Cathode&amp;objid=1074096534&amp;cfgid=1073741824&amp;version=versionless&amp;parent_id=1073988136&amp;sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EGL lighting products |url=http://www.egl-lighting.com/products.html |accessdate=9 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20101026042259/http://www.egl-lighting.com:80/products.html |archivedate=October 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term &quot;neon lamp&quot; refers to tubing that is smaller than 15&amp;nbsp;mm diameter{{cn|date=September 2015}} and typically operates at approximately 40 milliamps.  These lamps are commonly used for neon signs.

==Details==
The cathode is the negative electrode. Any gas discharge lamp has a positive (anode) and a negative electrode. Both electrodes alternate between acting as an anode and a cathode when these devices run with [[alternating current]].

A ''cold cathode'' is distinguished from a [[hot cathode]] that is heated to induce [[thermionic emission]] of [[electron]]s. Discharge tubes with hot cathodes have an envelope filled with low pressure gas and containing two electrodes. Examples are most common [[fluorescent lamp]]s, high pressure discharge lamps and [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s.

The surface of cold cathodes can emit [[secondary electrons]] at a ratio greater than unity (breakdown).  An electron that leaves the cathode will collide with neutral gas molecules.  The collision may just excite the molecule, but sometimes it will knock an electron free to create a positive ion.  The original electron and the freed electron continue toward the anode and may create more positive ions.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;For details, see [[Townsend avalanche]].&lt;/ref&gt; The result is for each electron that leaves the cathode, several positive ions are generated that eventually crash onto the cathode. Some crashing positive ions may generate a secondary electron. The discharge is self-sustaining when for each electron that leaves the cathode, enough positive ions hit the cathode to free, on average, another electron. External circuitry limits the discharge current.  Cold cathode discharge lamps use higher voltages than hot cathode ones. The resulting strong electric field near the cathode accelerates ions to a sufficient velocity to create free electrons from the cathode material.

Another mechanism to generate free electrons from a cold metallic surface is [[field electron emission]]. It is used in some [[x-ray tube]]s, the [[field emission microscopy|field electron microscope]] (FEM), and [[field emission display]]s (FEDs).

Cold cathodes sometimes have a [[Rare earth element|rare earth]] coating to enhance electron emission. Some types contain a source of [[beta radiation]] to start [[ionization]] of the gas that fills the tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1860149}}, Discharge tube.&lt;/ref&gt; In some tubes, [[glow discharge]] around the cathode is usually minimized; instead there is a so-called positive column, filling the tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|2103033}}, Electron emissive electrode&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1316967}}, Gaseous-conduction lamp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Positive column is part of a glow discharge, such as in the [[Moore lamp]]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the [[neon lamp]] and [[nixie tube]]s. Nixie tubes too are cold-cathode neon displays that are in-line, but not in-plane, display devices.

Cold cathode devices typically use a complex [[high voltage power supply]] with some mechanism for limiting current. Although creating the initial space charge and the first arc of current through the tube may require a very high voltage, once the tube begins to heat up the electrical resistance drops, thus increasing the [[electric current]] through the lamp. To offset this effect and maintain normal operation, the supply voltage is gradually lowered. In the case of tubes with an ionizing gas, the gas can become a very hot [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] and electrical resistance is greatly reduced. If operated from a simple power supply without current limiting, this reduction in resistance would lead to damage to the power supply and overheating of the tube electrodes.

==Applications==
[[File:Cold-Cathode-CFL-illuminated.jpg|thumb|right|
alt=A photo of an illuminated compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) of the cold cathode variety|An illuminated cold cathode [[Compact Fluorescent Lamp|CFL]].]]

Cold cathodes are used in [[cold-cathode rectifier]]s, such as the [[crossatron]] and [[mercury-arc valve]]s, and [[cold cathode amplifier]]s, such as in [[automatic message accounting]] and other [[pseudospark switch]]ing applications. Other examples include the [[thyratron]], [[krytron]], [[sprytron]], and [[ignitron]] tubes.

A common cold-cathode application is in [[neon sign]]s and other locations where the ambient temperature is likely to drop well below freezing, The [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster]] (Big Ben) uses cold-cathode lighting behind the clock faces where continual striking and failure to strike in cold weather would be undesirable. Large cold-cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) have been produced in the past, and are still used today when shaped, long-life linear light sources are required. {{As of|2011}}, miniature CCFLs were extensively used as [[backlight]]s for [[computer]] and television [[liquid crystal display]]s. CCFL lifespans vary in LCD televisions depending on transient voltage surges and temperature levels in usage environments.

Due to its efficiency, CCFL technology has expanded into room lighting. Costs are similar to those of traditional [[fluorescent lighting]],{{Clarify|date=August 2011|reason=is this cost of lamps, running cost, total cost?}} but with several advantages; The light emitted is easier on the eyes, bulbs turn on instantly to full output and are also dimmable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solé Lighting&quot;&gt;[http://solelighting.com/ Solé Lighting (commercial site advocating CCFLs)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of internal heating===
In systems using [[alternating current]] but without separate [[anode]] structures, the electrodes alternate as anodes and cathodes,  and the impinging electrons can cause substantial localized heating, often to [[red heat]]. The electrode may take advantage of this heating to facilitate the thermionic emission of electrons when it is acting as a cathode. (''Instant start'' fluorescent lamps employ this aspect; they start as cold-cathode devices, but soon localized heating of the fine [[tungsten]] wire cathodes causes them to operate in the same mode as [[hot cathode]] lamps.)

This aspect is problematic in the case of backlights used for [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] TV displays. New energy efficiency regulations being proposed in many countries will require variable backlighting—this also improves the perceived contrast range highly desirable for LCD TV sets. However, CCFLs are strictly limited in the degree to which they can be dimmed, both because a lower plasma current will lower the temperature of the cathode, causing erratic operation, and because running the cathode at too low a temperature drastically shortens the life of the lamps.{{cn|date=November 2015}} Much research is being directed to this problem{{By whom|date=August 2013}}, but high-end manufacturers are now turning to high-efficiency white [[LED]]s as a better solution.

In [[vacuum tube]]s, a '''hot cathode''' or '''thermionic cathode''' is a [[cathode]] electrode which is heated to make it emit [[electron]]s due to [[thermionic emission]].  The heating element is usually an [[electrical filament]], heated by a separate [[electric current]] passing through it.  Hot cathodes typically achieve much higher power density than cold cathodes, emitting significantly more electrons from the same surface area. [[Cold cathode]]s rely on [[field electron emission]] or [[secondary electron]] emission from positive ion bombardment and do not require heating.  There are two types of hot cathode.  In a ''directly-heated cathode'', the filament is the cathode and emits the electrons.  In an ''indirectly-heated cathode'', the filament or ''heater'' heats a separate metal cathode electrode which emits the electrons.

From the 1920s to the 1960s, virtually every electronic device used hot cathode vacuum tubes.  Today, hot cathodes are used as the source of electrons in  [[fluorescent lamp]]s, [[vacuum tube]]s, and [[electron gun]]s in [[cathode ray tube]]s and laboratory equipment such as [[electron microscope]]s,

A [[cathode]] electrode in a vacuum tube or other vacuum system is a metal surface which emits [[electron]]s into the evacuated space of the tube.  Since the negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positive [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of the metal atoms, they normally stay inside the metal, and require energy to leave it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avadhanulu&quot;&gt;{{cite book

There are two types of hot cathodes:&lt;ref name=&quot;Avadhanulu&quot; /&gt;
*'''Directly heated cathode''': In this type, the filament itself is the cathode and emits the electrons directly.  Directly heated cathodes were used in the first vacuum tubes.  Today they are used in [[fluorescent tube]]s and most high power transmitting vacuum tubes.
*'''Indirectly heated cathode''': In this type, the filament is not the cathode but rather heats a separate cathode consisting of a sheet metal cylinder surrounding the filament which then emits electrons.  Indirectly heated cathodes are used in most low power vacuum tubes.  For example, in most vacuum tubes the cathode is a nickel tube heated by a tungsten filament inside it, and the heat from the filament causes the outside surface of the tube to emit electrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot; /&gt;   The filament of an indirectly heated cathode is usually called the ''heater''.   The main reason for using an indirectly heated cathode is to isolate the rest of the vacuum tube from the electric potential across the filament, allowing vacuum tubes use [[alternating current]] to heat the filament.  In a tube in which the filament itself was the cathode, the alternating [[electric field]] from the filament surface would affect the movement of the electrons and introduce hum into the tube output.  It also allows the filaments in all the tubes in an electronic device to be tied together and supplied from the same current source, even though the cathodes they heat may be at different potentials.

Directly heated cathodes operate at higher temperatures and produce a brighter glow.  The cathode is behind the other tube elements and not directly visible. ]]

In order to improve electron emission, cathodes are usually treated with chemicals, compounds of metals with a low [[work function]].  These form a metal layer on the surface which emits more electrons.  Treated cathodes require less surface area, lower temperatures and less power to supply the same cathode current.  The untreated tungsten filaments used in early vacuum tubes (called &quot;bright emitters&quot;) had to be heated to 2500&amp;nbsp;°F (1400&amp;nbsp;°C), white-hot, to produce sufficient thermionic emission for use, while modern coated cathodes produce far more electrons at a given temperature so they only have to be heated to 800-1100&amp;nbsp;°F (425-600&amp;nbsp;°C)&lt;ref name=&quot;Avadhanulu&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Types==

===Oxide-coated cathodes===
The most common type of indirectly heated cathode is the oxide-coated cathode, in which the nickel cathode surface has a coating of [[alkaline earth metal]] oxide to increase emission.   The earliest material used was [[barium oxide]]; it forms a monatomic layer of [[barium]] with an extremely low work function. More modern formulations utilize a mixture of barium oxide, [[strontium oxide]] and [[calcium oxide]]. Another standard formulation is barium oxide, calcium oxide, and [[aluminium oxide]] in a 5:3:2 ratio. [[Thorium oxide]] is used as well. Oxide-coated cathodes operate at about 800-1000&amp;nbsp;°C, orange-hot. They are used in most small glass vacuum tubes, but are rarely used in high-power tubes because the coating is degraded by positive ions that bombard the cathode, accelerated by the high voltage on the tube.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamptech.co.uk/Documents/M8G%20MA%20Electrodes.htm MA Electrode Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;

For manufacturing convenience, the oxide-coated cathodes are usually coated with [[carbonate]]s, which are then converted to oxides by heating. The activation may be achieved by [[microwave heating]], direct electric current heating, or electron bombardment while the tube is on the exhausting machine, until the production of gases ceases. The purity of cathode materials is crucial for tube lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transfixr.com/strafe_tube.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Ba content significantly increases on the surface layers of oxide cathodes down to several tens of nanometers in depth, after the cathode activation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Barium oxide reacts with traces of silicon in the underlying metal, forming barium silicate (Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) layer. This layer has high electrical resistance, especially under discontinuous current load, and acts as a resistor in series with the cathode. This is particularly undesirable for tubes used in computer applications, where they can stay without conducting current for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;RCA&quot;&gt;Electron Tube Design, Radio Corporation of America, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Barium is also sublimating from the heated cathode, and depositing on nearby structures. For electron tubes, where the grid is subjected to high temperatures and barium contamination would facilitate electron emission from the grid itself, higher proportion of calcium is added to the coating mix (up to 20% of calcium carbonate).&lt;ref name=&quot;RCA&quot;/&gt;

===Boride cathodes===
[[File:LaB6HotCathode.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Lanthanum hexaboride hot cathode]]
[[File:Lab6cathodes.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Lanthanum hexaboride hot cathodes]]
[[Lanthanum hexaboride]] (LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[cerium hexaboride]] (CeB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) are used as the coating of some high-current cathodes. Hexaborides show low work function, around 2.5 [[electronvolt|eV]]. They are also resistant to poisoning. Cerium boride cathodes show lower evaporation rate at 1700 [[Kelvin|K]] than lanthanum boride, but it becomes equal at 1850 K and higher. Cerium boride cathodes have one and a half times the lifetime of lanthanum boride, due to its higher resistance to carbon contamination. Boride cathodes are about ten times as &quot;bright&quot; as the tungsten ones and have 10-15 times longer lifetime. They are used e.g. in [[electron microscope]]s, [[microwave tube]]s, [[electron lithography]], [[electron beam welding]], [[X-Ray tube]]s, and [[free electron laser]]s. However these materials tend to be expensive.

Other hexaborides can be employed as well; examples are [[calcium hexaboride]], [[strontium hexaboride]], [[barium hexaboride]], [[yttrium hexaboride]], [[gadolinium hexaboride]], [[samarium hexaboride]], and [[thorium hexaboride]].

===Thoriated filaments===
The most common type of directly heated cathode, used in most high power transmitting tubes, is the [[thoriated tungsten]] filament, discovered in 1914 and made practical by [[Irving Langmuir]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Turner page 7-37&lt;/ref&gt; A small amount of [[thorium]] is added to the tungsten of the filament. The filament is heated white-hot, at about 2400&amp;nbsp;°C, and thorium atoms migrate to the surface of the filament and form the emissive layer. Heating the filament in a hydrocarbon atmosphere carburizes the surface and stabilizes the emissive layer.  Thoriated filaments can have very long lifetimes and are resistant to the ion bombardment that occurs at high voltages, because fresh thorium continually diffuses to the surface, renewing the layer. They are used in nearly all high-power vacuum tubes for radio transmitters, and in some tubes for [[hi-fi]] amplifiers. Their lifetimes tend to be longer than those of oxide cathodes.&lt;ref&gt;http://userweb.suscom.net/~mos/knowledgebase/tp2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thorium alternatives====
Due to concerns about thorium radioactivity and toxicity, efforts have been made to find alternatives. One of them is zirconiated tungsten, where [[zirconium dioxide]] is used instead of thorium dioxide. Other replacement materials are [[lanthanum(III) oxide]], [[yttrium(III) oxide]], [[cerium(IV) oxide]], and their mixtures.&lt;ref name=&quot;freepatentsonline.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5911919.html Electron emission materials and components: United States Patent 5911919]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other materials===
In addition to the listed oxides and borides, other materials can be used as well. Some examples are [[carbide]]s and [[boride]]s of [[transition metal]]s, e.g. [[zirconium carbide]], [[hafnium carbide]], [[tantalum carbide]], [[hafnium diboride]], and their mixtures. Metals from [[group (periodic table)|groups]] [[group 3 element|IIIB]] ([[scandium]], [[yttrium]], and some [[lanthanide]]s, often [[gadolinium]] and [[samarium]]) and [[group 4 element|IVB]] ([[hafnium]], [[zirconium]], [[titanium]]) are usually chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;freepatentsonline.com&quot;/&gt;

In addition to tungsten, other [[refractory metal]]s and alloys can be used, e.g. [[tantalum]], [[molybdenum]] and [[rhenium]] and their alloys.

A [[barrier layer]] of other material can be placed between the base metal and the emission layer, to inhibit chemical reaction between these. The material has to be resistant to high temperatures, have high melting point and very low vapor pressure, and be electrically conductive. Materials used can be e.g. [[tantalum diboride]], [[titanium diboride]], [[zirconium diboride]], [[niobium diboride]], [[tantalum carbide]], [[zirconium carbide]], [[tantalum nitride]], and [[zirconium nitride]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4137476.html Thermionic cathode: United States Patent 4137476]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cathode heater==
A ''cathode heater'' is a heated wire filament used to heat the [[cathode]] in a [[vacuum tube]] or [[cathode ray tube]]. The cathode element had to achieve the required temperature in order for these tubes to function properly. This is why older electronics often needed some time to &quot;warm up&quot; after being powered on; this phenomenon can still be observed in the cathode ray tubes of some modern televisions and [[computer monitor]]s. The cathode heats to a temperature that causes [[electron]]s to be 'boiled out' of its surface into the evacuated space in the tube, a process called [[thermionic emission]]. The temperature required for modern oxide-coated cathodes is around {{convert|800|-|1000|C|F}}

The cathode is usually in the form of a long narrow sheet metal cylinder at the center of the tube. The heater consists of a fine wire or ribbon, made of a high [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] metal alloy like [[nichrome]], similar to the [[heating element]] in a [[toaster]] but finer. It runs through the center of the cathode, often being coiled on tiny insulating supports or bent into hairpin-like shapes to give enough surface area to produce the required heat. The ends of the wire are electrically connected to two pins protruding from the end of the tube. When [[Electric current|current]] passes through the wire it becomes red hot, and the radiated heat strikes the inside surface of the cathode, heating it. The red or orange glow seen coming from operating vacuum tubes is produced by the heater.

There is not much room in the cathode, and the cathode is often built with the heater wire touching it. The inside of the cathode is insulated by a coating of [[alumina]] (aluminum oxide). This is not a very good insulator at high temperatures, therefore tubes have a rating for maximum voltage between cathode and heater, usually only 200 - 300 V.

Heaters require a low voltage, high current source of power. Miniature receiving tubes for line-operated equipment used on the order of 0.5 to 4 watts for heater power; high power tubes such as rectifiers or output tubes would have used on the order of 10 to 20 watts, and broadcast transmitter tubes might need a kilowatt or more to heat the cathode.&lt;ref&gt;Sōgo Okamura ''History of electron tubes'', IOS Press, 1994 ISBN 90-5199-145-2, pp. 106, 109, 120, 144, 174&lt;/ref&gt; 
The voltage required was usually 5 or 6 volts [[Alternating current|AC]]. This was supplied by a separate 'heater winding' on the device's power supply [[transformer]] that also supplied the higher voltages required by the tubes' plates and other electrodes.  A more common approach used in transformerless line-operated radio and television receivers such as the [[All American Five]] was to connect all the tube heaters in series across the supply line. Since all the heaters were rated at the same current, they would share voltage according to their heater ratings.
Battery-operated radio sets used direct-current power for the heaters (commonly known as filaments), and tubes intended for [[Battery (vacuum tube)|battery]] sets were designed to use as little filament power as necessary, to economize on battery replacement. The final models of tube-equipped radio receivers were built with subminiature tubes using less than 50 mA for the heaters, but these types were developed at about the same time as transistors which replaced them.  Where leakage or stray fields from the heater circuit could potentially be coupled to the cathode, direct current was sometimes used for heater power. This would eliminate a source of noise in sensitive audio or instrumentation circuits.

==Failure modes==
The emissive layers on coated cathodes degrade slowly with time, and much more quickly when the cathode is overloaded with too high current. The result is weakened emission and diminished power of the tubes, or in [[cathode ray tube|CRTs]] diminished brightness.

The activated electrodes can be destroyed by contact with [[oxygen]] or other chemicals (e.g. [[aluminium]], or [[silicate]]s), either present as residual gases, entering the tube via leaks, or released by [[outgassing]] or migration from the construction elements.   This results in diminished emissivity. This process is known as ''cathode poisoning''. High-reliability tubes had to be developed for the early [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] computer, with filaments free of traces of [[silicon]].

Slow degradation of the emissive layer and sudden burning and interruption of the filament are two main [[failure mode]]s of vacuum tubes.

A '''Williamson amplifier''' refers to a type of [[valve amplifier|vacuum tube (valve) amplifier]] whose circuit design uses the same principles as a design published by D.T.N. Williamson. Williamson proposed the standard which became generally accepted as the target figure for high-quality audio power amplifiers, for less than 0.1% total harmonic distortion at full rated power output.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;

== Design==

In April and May 1947, the British magazine ''[[Wireless World]]'' published a pair of articles by D.T.N. Williamson, under the title &quot;Design for a High-quality Amplifier.&quot;&lt;ref name=ww&gt;[http://www.sowter.co.uk/pdf/Williamson%20Amplifier.pdf] D.T.N. Willamson, The Williamson Amplifier - A collection of articles reprinted from Wireless world, (Reprint 1994).  Original articles appeared in ''Wireless World'' for April and May 1947, and an updated version with minor changes in August 1949, pp.282-287, with additions in October 1949 at p.365, and November 1949 at p.423.&lt;/ref&gt;  The design, which became known as the &quot;Williamson Amplifier&quot;, was an early  example of [[high fidelity]] in an [[sound reproduction|audio]] amplifier (the commercial [[LEAK]] &quot;Point One&quot; Type 15 amplifier of 1945 pre-dates it).  The design became widely known for the notably high quality of its audio reproduction, and many Williamson amplifiers were built, both for own use and for sale; follow-up articles were published, with a slightly revised design&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;

The simplicity of the design shows in the circuit diagram.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt; The overall negative feedback is clearly seen to be applied by the resistor R25 from the secondary of the [[Transformer#Output transformer|output transformer]] to the cathode of the input V1. While the output transformer is represented simply by the appropriate [[circuit symbol]], it is a component which must be designed with great care.

[[Printed circuit boards]] (PCBs) were rarely used at the time (they were less necessary than they became for complex semiconductor circuits, due to the relative simplicity of circuits and the use of large socketed components); [[point-to-point wiring]] was used.

== Description ==

The Williamson amplifier was of symmetric [[push-pull output|push-pull]] design and used [[negative feedback]] and a specially designed output transformer to produce lower levels of [[distortion]] than previous designs.

The design used [[triode]]s as phase inverters and drivers.  The original output stages used triode-connected [[KT66]] [[tetrode]]s, although a [[6L6]], with slightly lower output, could be used.

A notable characteristic of the design was the use of a [[negative feedback amplifier|negative feedback]] loop enclosing the whole amplifier, including the output transformer, rather than separate feedback around individual stages.  This approach to feedback requires care to be taken to avoid excessive phase-shift around the feedback loop (the transformer being a particular problem), to avoid the feedback becoming positive at any frequency, which would cause undesirable [[oscillator|oscillation]].

Earlier designs used transformers to couple the output signal from one stage to the next. A transformer with a centre-tapped secondary was used as a simple method to drive the push-pull output valves in anti-phase from the previous single-ended stage.

Signal transformers are a source of distortion; if the transformers are not included in the feedback loop, this distortion is not corrected. They also produce large, frequency-dependent phase shifts at higher frequencies, making feedback loops including the transformers problematical.

Williamson eliminated all transformers except the output transformer (unavoidable for matching the high valve impedance to the low loudspeaker impedance) by using capacitor coupling between stages, and a split-load valve voltage amplifier stage (&quot;[[phase splitter]]&quot;), again capacitor-coupled, to provide antiphase signal inputs to the symmetrical push-pull output stages.  There was thus a single signal transformer in the circuit; with careful design of the transformer and the feedback network significant negative feedback could be used before the onset of instability. A 1993 book by [[John Linsley Hood|Linsley Hood]] discusses the characteristics of the Williamson amplifier design and its performance compared to earlier and later designs.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Linsley Hood]], &quot;The Art of Linear Electronics&quot;, (publ. Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, 1993) esp. ch.9, pages 144-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Williamson design demonstrates the maturity that tube amplification had reached by the late 1940s. Other than the British [[Mullard 5-10]] circuit and David Hafler's [[Dynaco]] ST-70, there was little improvement in the fundamentals. One improvement that was widely used was an output transformer with additional taps allowing use of [[Alan Blumlein|Blumlein's]]  distributed load or [[Ultra-Linear|ultra-linear]] technique, which allowed the output stage, before applying feedback, to operate at a power intermediate between that available from a triode and the significantly higher power from a pentode or [[beam tetrode]], with distortion better than either.

=== Valve lineup ===
The [[vacuum tube|valve]]s used in the original 1947 design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=D.T.N.|journal=Wireless World|date=May 1947|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; were four single triodes (the L63), a directly heated U52 rectifier, and a pair of KT66 beam tetrodes, all from the [[Marconi-Osram Valve|Marconi-Osram Valve (MOV)]] Company. In D.T.N. Williamson's 1949 update in Wireless World several small changes to the circuit were suggested along with a list of alternative triodes and the more significant change in rectifier to the indirectly heated Cossor 53KU or 5V4 to prevent &quot;a damaging voltage surge when the amplifier is switched on&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=D.T.N.|journal=Wireless World|date=August 1949|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson said there &quot;is no exact equivalent for the Osram type KT66, and its use is recommended where possible. When the equipment is to be used overseas, the KT66 may be difficult to obtain, and the 6L6 glass and metal types may be regarded as direct replacements, with the proviso that the total anode and screen dissipation should be reduced from 25 W to 21.5 W by reducing the total current from 125&amp;nbsp;mA to 110&amp;nbsp;mA by adjustment of R&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=D.T.N.|journal=Wireless World|date=January 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Follow-up articles in Wireless World from October 1949 to May 1952 included circuits for Tone controls, Radio Feeder Unit, and modifications for High-impedance Pickups and Long-playing record equalisation. The valves used are:

== Historical significance ==
Even two decades later, the Williamson amplifier's performance was a standard of comparison for innovative successor developments, including well-known semiconductor audio amplifiers such as Linsley Hood's transistor &quot;Simple Class-A Amplifier&quot;, published in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sound.westhost.com/jll_hood.htm John Linsley Hood, ''Wireless World'' for April 1969, pp.148-153.]&lt;/ref&gt; with explicit discussion of Williamson's criterion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1625">[[Image:6N3P.jpg|thumb|right|150px|6N3P vacuum tubes USSR]]The '''6N3P''' (Russian: '''6Н3П''') is a [[Russia]]n-made direct equivalent of the '''2C51''' medium gain dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]].  It may be used as an amplifier, mixer, oscillator or multivibrator over a frequency range [[Audio frequency|AF]] through [[VHF]].  The Russian tube is slightly larger in size than the American tube.

== Basic data ==

(per each triode)

Uf = 6.3 V, If = 350 mA, µ = 36, Ia = 7.7 mA, S = 4.9 mA/V, Pa = 1.5 W

== History of use ==

6N3P was widely used for FM band radio input unit stages (nearly all 1960s Soviet radios with FM band employed the same input unit on a separate [[subchassis]]). Currently it has found use in [[DIY]] preamps. A ruggedized/industrial version of the tube is designated '''6N3P-EV''' (Russian: '''6Н3П-ЕВ''')

== Chinese 6N3 ==
eBay has proliferated with [http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=6n3+preamp&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_odkw=6n3&amp;_osacat=0&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m270.l1313 pre-amps] apparently from Hong Kong that are largely populated with the 6N3, which is said to be the Chinese version of the 6N3P.  The 6N3Ps are newly made (unlike the Soviet &quot;new old stock,&quot; and the pre-amps appear to be the product of a cottage hifi industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2219">[[Image:6N1P.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Current production 6N1P-EV tube (1999) branded with the original factory logo (right) and Svetlana brand name (left)]] The '''6N1P''' ({{lang-ru|'''6Н1П'''}}) is a [[Russia]]n-made miniature 9-pin medium gain double [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] intended for use as a line audio amplifier and cathode driver.

Basic data:
* Uf = 6.3 V, If = 600 mA
* µ = 35
* Ia = 7.5 mA
* S = 4.35 mA/V
* Pa = 2.2 W

The '''6N1P''' has similar ratings to the [[6DJ8]] and in the past was sometimes rebranded as such, however differences between the two types (the '''6N1P''' requires double the filament current and has only one third the S value) mean they are not directly interchangeable. The S is about 4.35 ma/V, the 6DJ8/ECC88 has a S of 12.5 ma/V and a gain of 33 and a lower internal resistance. The curves of the 6DJ8 have a better linearity too. It is therefore inaccurate to say that these two tubes are identical.

The closest western equivalent to the 6N1P is the well known 6BQ7A. A ruggedized/extended ratings version of the tube is designated '''6N1P-EV''' ({{lang-ru|'''6Н1П-ЕВ'''}}). It has currently found a use as a driver tube in hi-fi tube amplifiers (such as Audio Research models VS55 and VS110) because of its excellent low distortion and low noise characteristics. The tube is manufactured by the &quot;Voskhod&quot; plant in [[Kaluga]], [[Russia]] (see [http://www.ominous-valve.com/russtube.html]) and is distributed in the West under the [[Sovtek]] and [[Svetlana]] brand names.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2373">The '''6N2P''', (Russian: '''6Н2П''') also sometimes spelled in English '''&quot;6H2Pi&quot;''' is a miniature 9-pin dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] manufactured in [[USSR]], [[Russia]] and [[China]] with characteristics similar to the [[RCA]] [[12AX7]].  The most significant difference between the two is that '''6N2P''' has its two filament elements connected in parallel, unlike the series filament connection of the 12AX7, and it is thus only possible to operate it from a 6.3 volt, 340 mA filament supply (whereas a [[12AX7]] may be operated from either 6.3 or 12.6 volts, at 300 mA or 150 mA, respectively.)  The '''6N2P''' also has slightly lower gain than a [[12AX7]]. The '''6N2P'''slightly lower-gain and higher filament draw is similar to the 5751 tube (introduced in the mid '50s)and sold in quantity to the US military. The 5751 tube may be operated from 6.3 volts at 350 mA (the higher current draw is for increased reliability) for use in avionics.

[[File:Four_6n2p_vacuum_triodes.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Different 6N2P versions]]

In the 1970s an improved and more rugged version of the '''6N2P''' was introduced, designated '''6N2P-EV''' (Russian: '''6Н2П-ЕВ''') The 5751WA tube is a ruggedized military version of the 5751, and is the closest equivalent to the '''6N2P-EV'''. Currently, a [[12AX7]] variant derived from the '''6N2P-EV''' is being produced by [[Sovtek]], under the designation '''12AX7WA'''. 

A [[China|Chinese]] version of '''6N2P''' exists, labeled in Latin lettering (instead of [[Cyrillic]]) '''6N2'''.

In the 1990s a (now extinct) line of &quot;Red Bear&quot; [[guitar amplifiers]] was being produced in [[Russia]] by Novik Ltd. and distributed in the [[United States]] by [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]].  These amplifiers used '''6N2P''' tubes instead of the much more common [[12AX7]], prompting user modifications of the amplifier to [[12AX7]], because the original Russian '''6N2P''' was scarcely available outside of Russia.

On the photo, from left to right - '''6N2P''' produced in [[USSR]] in 1967, 1974, '''6N2''' produced in [[China]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] '''6N2P-EV''' (left), produced in 1980.

The '''6DJ8''' is a miniature 9-pin medium gain dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]].   It is distinguished by its very high [[transconductance]], mostly the result of its frame grid construction. 

== Origins == 
Developed by [[Amperex Electronic|Amperex]], the American division of Philips in 1958. It was developed by Philips in the Netherlands under European designation ECC88. The series-string version 7DJ8 / PCC88 was also introduced at the same time. The 6DJ8 was designed for use as a low-noise amplifier in VHF and UHF TV tuners, an improved successor to the usual 6BK7, but due to its high gain it was used in much high-end test equipment.  Most high-quality oscilloscopes from the 1950s to the 1960s have many 6DJ8 tubes.

== Audio ==
Although not originally designed for the purpose, it became popular in [[hi-fi]] audio amplifiers.  European-produced version of the tube is designated '''ECC88'''.  An industrial (improved/higher ratings) version of the tube was designated '''6922''' / E88CC between 1959 and 1961. Siemens introduced their own super ECC88 / 6DJ8 at the same time under CCa type.   New Old Stock (NOS) '''6DJ8'''s and '''ECC88'''s produced in the past by major American or West European vacuum tube manufacturers (such as [[Philips]] or [[Amperex]]) remain extremely popular with and highly sought by [[audiophiles]].  A version (direct equivalent) of this tube was also produced in the Soviet Union as '''6N23P''' (Russian: '''6Н23П''') and in China as '''6N11'''.

{{As of|2015}} the tube was being produced in three versions in Eastern Europe - [[Slovakia]] by JJ Electronics (ex-Tesla), and in Russia - '''6DJ8''' for [[Sovtek]] and '''6922''' for [[Electro-Harmonix]].

Because of a different pinout (a 9-pin base versus 7-pin base) than an 6AQ5/EL90, it cannot be used as a plug-in replacement for these types, however, it will work in the same circuit with component values unchanged.  Its maximum plate/screen voltage and dissipation ratings are actually slightly higher than a [[6AQ5]].  A ruggedized/extended ratings version of the tube is designated '''6P1P-EV''' (Russian: '''6П1П-ЕВ''') roughly equivalent to the [[6AQ5W]].  A [[China|Chinese]]-manufactured version of the tube also exists, labeled '''6P1'''.

The type was commonly used in Soviet-built vacuum tube radios and TV sets as an output audio amplifier, until it was replaced by the higher-performance 6P14P (an exact equivalent of the [[EL84]]).

The tube is no longer believed to be in production.

'''12AT7''' (also known in [[Europe]] by the [[Mullard-Philips tube designation]] of ECC81) is a miniature 9-pin medium-gain (60) dual-[[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] popular in [[guitar amplifiers]].  It belongs to a large family of dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tubes]] which share the same pinout (EIA 9A), including in particular the very commonly used low-mu [[12AU7]] and high-mu [[12AX7]].

The 12AT7 has somewhat lower voltage gain than the 12AX7, but higher [[transconductance]] and plate current, which makes it suitable for high frequency applications.

Originally the tube was intended for operation in [[VHF]] circuits, such as [[TV]] sets and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] tuners, as an [[oscillator]]/frequency converter, but it also found wide use in audio as a driver and phase-inverter in vacuum tube [[push-pull amplifier]] circuits.

This tube is essentially two 6AB4s or two EC92s in a single envelope.

The tube has a center-tapped filament so it can be used in either 6.3V 300mA or 12.6V 150mA heater circuits.

[[Image:EIA-9A.png]]

{{As of|2012}} the 12AT7 was manufactured in [[Russia]] ([[Electro-Harmonix]] brand), [[Slovakia]], and [[China]].

The '''12AU7''' and its variants are a miniature nine-pin (B9A base) medium-gain dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]].  It belongs to a large family of dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tubes]] which share the same pinout ([[RETMA tube designation|RETMA]] 9A). '''12AU7''' is also known in Europe under its [[Mullard-Philips tube designation]] '''ECC82'''. There are many equivalent tubes with different names, some identical, some designed for ruggedness, long life, or other characteristics; examples are the US military 5814A and the European special-quality E82CC and E182CC.

The tube is popular in [[hi-fi]] vacuum tube audio as a low-noise line amplifier, driver (especially for tone stacks), and phase-inverter in vacuum tube [[push-pull amplifier]] circuits. There are opinions which indicate that this popularity is caused by audiophile industry/media polarization, not by its performance. &lt;ref name=&quot;illusion-engines_1&quot;&gt;Lynn Olson. [http://www.nutshellhifi.com/library/illusion-engines.html Illusion Engines (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely used, in special-quality versions such as E82CC and 5814A, in pre-semiconductor [[digital computer]] circuitry. Use of special-quality versions outside of the purpose they were designed for may not be optimal; for example, a version for digital computers may be designed for long life without [[cathode poisoning]] when mostly switched to low-current mode in switching applications, but with little attention to parameters of interest only for linear applications such as linearity of transfer characteristic, matching between the two sections, [[microphony]], etc.

This tube is essentially two 6C4s or two EC90s in the same envelope.
 
Double triodes of the 12AU7 family have a center-tapped filament for use in either 6.3V 300mA or 12.6V 150mA heater circuits.

{{As of|2012}} the 12AU7 continued to be manufactured in [[Russia]], [[Slovakia]], and [[China]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3734">A '''double diode triode''' is a type of electronic [[vacuum tube]] once widely used in [[radio]] receivers.  The tube has a [[triode]] for amplification, along with two diodes, one typically for use as a detector and the other as a rectifier for [[Automatic gain control]], in one envelope. In practice the two diodes usually share a common cathode. Multiple tube sections in one envelope minimized the number of tubes required in a radio or other apparatus.

In [[Mullard–Philips tube designation|European nomenclature]] a first letter &quot;E&quot; identifies tubes with heaters to be connected in parallel to a transformer winding of 6.3V; &quot;U&quot; identifies tubes with heaters to be connected in series across the mains supply, drawing 100&amp;nbsp;mA; and &quot;P&quot; identifies similar 300&amp;nbsp;mA series-connected tubes. Following the voltage letter, &quot;A&quot; stands for a low-current (signal) diode section, &quot;B&quot; for a double diode with common cathode section, &quot;C&quot; for a triode section, &quot;F&quot; for a pentode section, &quot;H&quot; for a hexode or heptode section, and &quot;L&quot; for a power tetrode or pentode section. The first number identified the base type, for example '''3''' for Octal base; '''9''' for B7G sub-miniature 7 pin. The remaining numbers identified a particular tube type; tubes with all characters except the first identical had identical electrodes but a different heater; e.g. the EBC81 and UBC81. Generally, odd numbers identified tubes / valves with variable mu characteristics and even numbers straight, or sharp cut-off types.  

American nomenclature, also used in Europe, used a number to identify the heater voltage, letters to identify the type, with no systematic coding system and a number specifying the total number of electrodes. The 6.3V EABC80 has 8 electrodes; the US equivalent is 6AK8, where the &quot;AK&quot; has no particular meaning (but the 6N8 is a dual diode+pentode, also with 8 electrodes, EBF80).

There are many double diode triode tubes, including EBC81 (6BD7), EBC91 (6AV6), the older EBC41 (identical to EBC81 but Rimlock (B8A) socket instead of noval), EBC33, EBC21, EBC11, EBC2, ABC 1(4 V heater). The commoner tube line-ups of an AM radio with main transformer set having a double diode-triode were one of the following: ECH11+EF11+EBC11+EL11 Y8A Base, ECH42(or 41)+EF42 (or 41)+ EBC41+ EL41 (or 42) Rimlock Base, ECH81+EF80(85 or 89)+ EBC81(or 91)+ EL84 (noval Socket) + rectifier and magic eye indicator (depending on the radio class and manufacturer). AC/DC sets without mains transformer would use &quot;U&quot; tubes of the same types, e.g. UCH42+UF41+UBC41+UL41+UY41 rectifier.

There was also a tube with a single diode section, a double diode with common cathode and a triple diode triode, named EABC80 or 6AK8 and its versions for 300 mA and 100 mA named PABC80 (9AK8; for TV Sets) and UABC80 (27AK8) for transformerless radios with series heater chains. This tube was designed for early AM/FM (MW/VHF) radio sets and was widely used in many radios, almost until the end of the tube radio era. One diode is for [[automatic gain control]] (AGC), another for FM/VHF detection and the third for AM detection.

The main configurations for an early tube AM/FM/VHF set using EABC80 in the 1950s and '60s:

EC92+EF85(80 or 89)+ECH81+EF85(80 or 89)+EABC80+EL84(or EL95), ECC85+EF80(85 or89)+ECH81+EABC80+EL84(or EL95)+ rectifier (tube or solid state) and indicator, depending on the radio class and manufacturer. For AC/DC radios, UCC85+UCH81+UF80(85 or 89)+UABC80+UL84)+ rectifier and indicator. These configurations were kept until semiconductor (germanium) diodes became available, making this type of tube obsolete.

[[File:Dynodes.jpg|thumb|right|Dynodes inside a photomultiplier tube]]
'''Photomultiplier tubes''' ('''photomultipliers''' or '''PMT'''s for short), members of the class of [[vacuum tube]]s, and more specifically vacuum [[phototube]]s, are extremely sensitive detectors of light in the [[ultraviolet]], [[visible light|visible]], and [[near-infrared]] ranges of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. These detectors multiply the current produced by incident light by as much as 100 million times (i.e., 160 [[decibel|dB]]), in multiple [[dynode]] stages, enabling (for example) individual [[photons]] to be detected when the incident [[flux]] of light is very low. Unlike most vacuum tubes, they are not obsolete.

The combination of high [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], low [[Noise (electronics)|noise]], high frequency response or, equivalently, ultra-fast response, and large area of collection has maintained photomultipliers an essential place in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]], [[astronomy]], medical [[diagnostics]] including [[blood tests]], [[medical imaging]], motion picture film scanning ([[telecine]]), [[Barrage jamming|radar jamming]], and high-end image scanners known as [[drum scanner]]s. Elements of photomultiplier technology, when integrated differently, are the basis of [[night vision device]]s.

[[Semiconductor device]]s, particularly [[avalanche photodiode]]s, are alternatives to photomultipliers; however, photomultipliers are uniquely well-suited for applications requiring low-noise, high-sensitivity detection of light that is imperfectly [[collimated light|collimated]].

==Structure and operating principles==
[[File:PhotoMultiplierTubeAndScintillator.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Schematic of a photomultiplier tube coupled to a [[scintillator]]. This arrangement is for detection of gamma rays.]]
[[File:PMT Voltage Divider.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Typical photomultiplier voltage divider circuit using negative high voltage.]]

Photomultipliers are typically constructed with an evacuated glass housing, containing a [[photocathode]], several [[dynode]]s, and an [[anode]]. Incident [[photons]] strike the [[photocathode]] material, which is usually a thin [[vacuum deposition|vapor-deposited]] conducting layer on the inside of the entry window of the device. [[Electron]]s are ejected from the surface as a consequence of the [[photoelectric effect]]. These electrons are directed by the focusing [[electrode]] toward the [[electron multiplier]], where electrons are multiplied by the process of [[secondary emission]].
 
The electron multiplier consists of a number of electrodes called ''dynodes''. Each dynode is held at a more positive potential, by ≈100 Volts, than the preceding one. A primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon, or about 3&amp;nbsp;eV for &quot;blue&quot; photons, minus the [[work function]] of the photocathode. A small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons. (In the example Figure, the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray.)  The primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field. They each arrive with ≈100&amp;nbsp;eV kinetic energy imparted by the potential difference. Upon striking the first dynode, more low energy electrons are emitted, and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode. The geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage. For example, if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron, and if there are 12 dynode stages, then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 5&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; electrons.  This last stage is called the [[anode]].  This large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable, for example on an oscilloscope, signaling the arrival of the photon(s) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier.

The necessary distribution of voltage along the series of dynodes is created by a voltage divider chain, as illustrated in the Figure.  In the example, the photocathode is held at a negative high voltage of order 1000V, while the anode is very close to ground potential.  The capacitors across the final few dynodes act as local reservoirs of charge to help maintain the voltage on the dynodes while electron avalanches propagate through the tube.  Many variations of design are used in practice; the design shown is merely illustrative.  

There are two common photomultiplier orientations, the ''head-on'' or ''end-on'' (transmission mode) design, as shown above, where light enters the flat, circular top of the tube and passes the photocathode, and the ''side-on'' design (reflection mode), where light enters at a particular spot on the side of the tube, and impacts on an opaque photocathode. The side-on design is used, for instance, in the [[#Electrostatic photomultipliers (1937–present)|type 931]], the first mass-produced PMT. Besides the different photocathode materials, performance is also affected by the transmission of the window material that the light passes through, and by the arrangement of the dynodes. A large number of photomultiplier models are available having various combinations of these, and other, design variables. Either of the manuals mentioned will provide the information needed to choose an appropriate design for a particular application.

==History==

===Combining two scientific discoveries===
The invention of the photomultiplier is predicated upon two prior achievements, the separate discoveries of the [[photoelectric effect]] and of [[secondary emission]].

====Photoelectric effect====
The first demonstration of the [[photoelectric effect]] was carried out in 1887 by [[Heinrich Hertz]] using ultraviolet light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 |author=H. Hertz
 |title=Ueber einen Einfluss des ultravioletten Lichtes auf die electrische Entladung
 |journal=Annalen der Physik
 |volume=267 |issue=8 |pages=983–1000 |year=1887

 |doi=10.1002/andp.18872670827|bibcode = 1887AnP...267..983H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant for practical applications, Elster and Geitel two years later demonstrated the same effect using ''visible'' light striking alkali metals (potassium and sodium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elster|first1=Julius|last2=Geitel|first2=Hans|title=Ueber die Entladung negativ electrischer Körper durch das Sonnen- und Tageslicht|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=274|pages=497|year=1889|doi=10.1002/andp.18892741202|bibcode = 1889AnP...274..497E|issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of [[caesium]], another [[alkali metal]], has permitted the range of sensitive wavelengths to be extended towards longer wavelengths in the red portion of the visible spectrum.

Historically, the photoelectric effect is associated with [[Albert Einstein]], who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the fundamental principle of [[quantum mechanics]] in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 |author=A. Einstein
 |title=Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt
 |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf
 |journal=Annalen der Physik
 |volume=322 |issue=6 |pages=132–148 |year=1905
 |doi=10.1002/andp.19053220607|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..132E }}&lt;/ref&gt; an accomplishment for which Einstein received the 1921 [[Nobel Prize]]. It is worthwhile to note that [[Heinrich Hertz]], working 18 years earlier, had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency but independent of the optical intensity. This fact implied a discrete nature of light, i.e. the existence of ''quanta'', for the first time.

====Secondary emission====
The phenomenon of [[secondary emission]] (the ability of [[electrons]] in a vacuum tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an [[electrode]]) was, at first, limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices (which lacked [[photosensitivity]]). In 1902, Austin and Starke reported that the metal surfaces impacted by electron beams emitted a larger number of electrons than were incident.&lt;ref&gt;H. Bruining, Physics and applications of secondary electron emission, (McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc.; 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the newly discovered secondary emission to the amplification of signals was only proposed after [[World War I]] by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] scientist [[Joseph Slepian]] in a 1919 patent.&lt;ref&gt;J. Slepian, Westinghouse Electric, &quot;Hot Cathode Tube&quot; {{US Patent|1450265}}, Issued April 3, 1923 (Filed 1919)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The race towards a practical electronic television camera=====
The ingredients for inventing the photomultiplier were coming together during the 1920s as the pace of vacuum tube technology accelerated. The primary goal for many, if not most, workers was the need for a practical television camera technology. Television had been pursued with primitive prototypes for decades prior to the 1934 introduction of the first practical camera (the [[iconoscope]]). Early prototype television cameras lacked sensitivity. Photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes, such as the iconoscope and (later) the [[orthicon]], to be sensitive enough to be practical. So the stage was set to combine the dual phenomena of [[photoemission]] (i.e., the photoelectric effect) with [[secondary emission]], both of which had already been studied and adequately understood, to create a practical photomultiplier.

=====First photomultiplier, single-stage (early 1934)=====
The first documented photomultiplier demonstration dates to the early 1934 accomplishments of an RCA group based in Harrison, NJ. Harley Iams and Bernard Salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain. These accomplishments were finalized ''prior'' to June 1934 as detailed in the manuscript submitted to [[Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers]] (Proc. IRE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iams|first1=H.|last2=Salzberg|first2=B.|title=The Secondary Emission Phototube|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|volume=23|pages=55|year=1935|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1935.227243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The device consisted of a semi-cylindrical [[photocathode]], a secondary emitter mounted on the axis, and a collector grid surrounding the secondary emitter. The tube had a gain of about eight and operated at frequencies well above 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.

=====Magnetic photomultipliers (mid 1934–1937)=====
Higher gains were sought than those available from the early single-stage photomultipliers. However, it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process, regardless of acceleration voltage. Thus, any single-stage photomultiplier is limited in gain. At the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 (very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity [[dynode]]s). For this reason, multiple-stage photomultipliers, in which the photoelectron yield could be multiplied successively in several stages, were an important goal. The challenge was to cause the photoelectrons to impinge on successively higher-voltage electrodes rather than to travel directly to the highest voltage electrode. Initially this challenge was overcome by using strong magnetic fields to bend the electrons' trajectories. Such a scheme had earlier been conceived by inventor J. Slepian by 1919 (see above).

Accordingly, leading international research organizations turned their attention towards improving photomultiplers to achieve higher gain with multiple stages. This work proceeded against a background of economic boom and bust, tyrannical dictatorship, and cataclysmic war clouds collecting on the horizon.

In the [[USSR]], RCA-manufactured radio equipment was introduced on a large scale by [[Joseph Stalin]] to construct broadcast networks, and the newly formed All-Union Scientific Research Institute for Television was gearing up a research program in vacuum tubes that was advanced for its time and place. Numerous visits were made by RCA scientific personnel to the [[USSR]] in the 1930s, prior to the [[Cold War]], to instruct the Soviet customers on the capabilities of RCA equipment and to investigate customer needs.&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Magoun [http://www.histech.nl/Shot2004/programma/txt/magoun.asp?file=magoun ''Adding Sight to Sound in Stalin’s Russia: RCA and the Transfer of Television Technology to the Soviet Union''], Society for the History of Technology (SHOT), Amsterdam (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; During one of these visits, in September 1934, RCA's [[Vladimir Zworykin]] was shown the first multiple-dynode photomultiplier, or ''photoelectron multiplier''. This pioneering device was proposed by Leonid A. Kubetsky in 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ru:Большая советская энциклопедия|trans_title=Great Soviet Encyclopedia|chapter=Кубецкий Леонид Александрович|trans_chapter=Kubetsky Leonid Aleksandrovich|language=Russian|year=1973|volume=13|edition=3|publisher=Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya|location=Moscow|chapterurl=http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%20%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B4%20%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he subsequently built in 1934. The device achieved gains of 1000x or more when demonstrated in June 1934. The work was submitted for print publication only two years later, in July 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kubetsky|first1=L.A.|title=Multiple Amplifier|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|volume=25|pages=421|year=1937|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1937.229045|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as emphasized in a recent 2006 publication of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (RAS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lubsandorzhiev|first1=B|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2006.05.221|title=On the history of photomultiplier tube invention|year=2006|pages=236|volume=567|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment|arxiv=physics/0601159|bibcode = 2006NIMPA.567..236L }}&lt;/ref&gt; which terms it &quot;Kubetsky's Tube.&quot; The Soviet device used a magnetic field to confine the secondary electrons and relied on the Ag-O-Cs photocathode which had been demonstrated by General Electric in the 1920s.

By October 1935, [[Zworykin|Vladimir Zworykin]], George Ashmun Morton, and Louis Malter of RCA in Camden, NJ submitted their manuscript describing the first comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of a multiple dynode tube — the device later called a ''photomultiplier''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zworykin|first1=V.K.|last2=Morton|first2=G.A.|last3=Malter|first3=L.|title=The Secondary Emission Multiplier-A New Electronic Device|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|volume=24|pages=351|year=1936|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1936.226435|issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — to Proc. IRE. The RCA prototype photomultipliers also used an Ag-O-Cs ([[silver oxide]]-[[caesium]]) photocathode. They exhibited a peak [[quantum efficiency]] of 0.4% at 800 [[nanometer|nm]].

=====Electrostatic photomultipliers (1937–present)=====
Whereas these early photomultipliers used the magnetic field principle, electrostatic photomultipliers (with no magnetic field) were demonstrated by [[Jan A. Rajchman|Jan Rajchman]] of RCA Laboratories in Princeton, NJ in the late 1930s and became the standard for all future commercial photomultipliers. The first mass-produced photomultiplier, the Type 931, was of this design and is still commercially produced today.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rajchman and E.W. Pike, RCA Technical Report TR-362, &quot;Electrostatic Focusing in Secondary Emission Multipliers,&quot; September 9, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Improved photocathodes=====
Also in 1936, a much improved photocathode, Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb ([[caesium]]-[[antimony]]), was reported by P. Görlich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Görlich|first1=P.|title=Über zusammengesetzte, durchsichtige Photokathoden|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|volume=101|pages=335|year=1936|doi=10.1007/BF01342330|bibcode = 1936ZPhy..101..335G|issue=5–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The caesium-antimony photocathode had a dramatically improved quantum efficiency of 12% at 400&amp;nbsp;nm, and was used in the first commercially successful photomultipliers manufactured by RCA (i.e., the 931-type) both as a photocathode and as a secondary-emitting material for the [[dynode]]s. Different photocathodes provided differing spectral responses.

===Spectral response of photocathodes===
In the early 1940s, the [[JEDEC]] (Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council), an industry committee on standardization, developed a system of designating spectral responses.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Relative spectral response data for
photosensitive devices (&quot;S&quot; curves),&quot; JEDEC Publication No. 50, Electronic Industries Association, Engineering Department, 2001 I Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy included the idea that the product's user need only be concerned about the response of the device rather than how the device may be fabricated. Various combinations of photocathode and window materials were assigned &quot;S-numbers&quot; (spectral numbers) ranging from S-1 through S-40, which are still in use today. For example, S-11 uses the caesium-antimony photocathode with a lime glass window, S-13 uses the same photocathode with a fused silica window, and S-25 uses a so-called &quot;multialkali&quot; photocathode (Na-K-Sb-Cs, or [[sodium]]-[[potassium]]-[[antimony]]-[[caesium]]) that provides extended response in the red portion of the visible light spectrum. No suitable photoemissive surfaces have yet been reported to detect wavelengths longer than approximately 1700 nanometers, which can be approached by a special (InP/InGaAs(Cs)) photocathode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamamatsu handbook&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

}} p. 34, Table 4-1: Typical Spectral Response Characteristics, Transmission Mode Photocathodes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of RCA===
For decades, RCA was responsible for performing the most important work in developing and refining photomultipliers. RCA was also largely responsible for the commercialization of photomultiplers. The company compiled and published an authoritative and very-widely used ''Photomultiplier Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=RCA Corporation|title=RCA Photomultiplier Manual|date=1970|url=http://www.archive.org/details/RcaPhotomultiplierManual}}&lt;/ref&gt; RCA made printed copies available for free upon request. The handbook, which continues to be made available online at no cost by the successors to RCA, is considered to be an essential reference.

Following a corporate break-up in the late 1980s involving the acquisition of RCA by [[General Electric]] and disposition of the divisions of RCA to numerous third parties, [[RCA]]'s photomultiplier business became an independent company.

===Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility===
The [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] facility was opened by the [[U.S. Navy]] in 1942 and operated by RCA for the manufacture of [[radio tube|radio]] and [[microwave tube]]s. Following [[World War II]], the naval facility was acquired by RCA. ''RCA Lancaster'', as it became known, was the base for development and production of commercial [[television]] products. In subsequent years other products were added, such as [[cathode ray tubes]], photomultiplier tubes, [[motion detection|motion-sensing]] light control switches, and [[closed-circuit television]] systems.

===Burle Industries===
Burle Industries, as a successor to the RCA Corporation, carried the RCA photomultiplier business forward after 1986, based in the Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility. The 1986 acquisition of RCA by [[General Electric]] resulted in the [[divestiture]] of the RCA Lancaster New Products Division. Hence, 45 years after being founded by the U.S. Navy, its management team, led by Erich Burlefinger, purchased the division and in 1987 founded Burle Industries.

In 2005, after eighteen years as an independent enterprise, Burle Industries and a key subsidiary were acquired by Photonis, a [[Europe]]an [[holding company]] [http://www.photonis.com Photonis Group]. Following the acquisition, Photonis was composed of Photonis Netherlands, Photonis France, Photonis USA, and Burle Industries.  Photonis USA operates the former Galileo Corporation Scientific Detector Products Group ([[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]]), which had been purchased by Burle Industries in 1999.  The group is known for [[microchannel plate detector]] (MCP) electron multipliers—an integrated micro-vacuum tube version of photomultipliers.  MCPs are used for imaging and scientific applications, including [[night vision device]]s.

On 9 March 2009, Photonis announced that it would cease all production of photomultipliers at both the Lancaster, Pennsylvania and the Brive, France plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photonis.com/holding/news/press_release_photonis_is_announcing_the_halt_of_its_photomultiplier_activity PHOTONIS will stop its Photomultiplier activity]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other companies===
The [[Japan]]-based company [[Hamamatsu Photonics]] (also known as Hamamatsu) has emerged since the 1950s as a leader in the photomultiplier industry. Hamamatsu, in the tradition of RCA, has published its own handbook, which is available without cost on the company's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamamatsu Photonics K. K.|title=PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES Basics and Applications|date=2007|url=http://www.edmundoptics.com/techsupport/resource_center/product_docs/manl_pmt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamamatsu uses different designations for particular photocathode formulations and introduces modifications to these designations based on Hamamatsu's proprietary research and development.

===Photocathode materials===
The photocathodes can be made of a variety of materials, with different properties. Typically the materials have low [[work function]] and are therefore prone to [[thermionic emission]], causing noise and dark current, especially the materials sensitive in infrared; cooling the photocathode lowers this thermal noise. The most common photocathode materials are:&lt;ref name=&quot;pmt&quot;&gt;[https://wwwmu.mpp.mpg.de/docs/pmtconstruct.pdf Photomultiplier Tubes. Construction and Operating Characteristics. Connections to External Circuits], Hamamatsu&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ag-O-Cs''': (Also called '''S1''') Transmission-mode, sensitive from 300–1200&amp;nbsp;nm. High dark current; used mainly in near-infrared, with the photocathode cooled.
* '''GaAs:Cs''': [[caesium]]-[[Activator (phosphor)|activated]] [[gallium arsenide]]. Flat response from 300 to 850&amp;nbsp;nm, fading towards ultraviolet and to 930&amp;nbsp;nm.
* '''InGaAs:Cs''': caesium-activated [[indium gallium arsenide]]. Higher infrared sensitivity than GaAs:Cs. Between 900–1000&amp;nbsp;nm much higher [[signal-to-noise ratio]] than Ag-O-Cs.
* '''Sb-Cs''': (Also called '''S11''') Caesium-activated [[antimony]]. Used for reflective mode photocathodes. Response range from ultraviolet to visible. Widely used.
* '''Bialkali''' ('''Sb-K-Cs''', '''Sb-Rb-Cs'''): caesium-activated antimony-rubidium or antimony-potassium alloy. Similar to Sb:Cs, with higher sensitivity and lower noise. Can be used for transmission-mode; favorable response to a NaI:Tl [[scintillator]] flashes makes them widely used in [[gamma spectroscopy]] and radiation detection.
** '''High-temperature bialkali''' ('''Na-K-Sb'''): can operate up to 175&amp;nbsp;°C, used in [[well logging]]. Low dark current at room temperature.
* '''Multialkali''' ('''Na-K-Sb-Cs'''): (Also called '''S20''') Wide spectral response from ultraviolet to near-infrared; special cathode processing can extend range to 930&amp;nbsp;nm. Used in broadband [[spectrophotometer]]s.
* '''Solar-blind''' ('''Cs-Te''', '''Cs-I'''): sensitive to vacuum-UV and ultraviolet. Insensitive to visible light and infrared (Cs-Te has cutoff at 320&amp;nbsp;nm, Cs-I at 200&amp;nbsp;nm).

===Window materials===
The windows of the photomultipliers act as wavelength filters; this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range, but special care has to be taken for uncommon wavelengths.
* '''[[Borosilicate glass]]''' is commonly used for near-infrared to about 300&amp;nbsp;nm. Glass with very low content of [[potassium]] can be used with bialkali photocathodes to lower the background radiation from the [[potassium-40]] isotope.
* '''Ultraviolet glass''' transmits visible and ultraviolet down to 185&amp;nbsp;nm. Used in spectroscopy.
* '''Synthetic [[fused quartz|silica]]''' transmits down to 160&amp;nbsp;nm, absorbs less UV than fused silica. Different thermal expansion than [[kovar]] (and than borosilicate glass that's expansion-matched to kovar), a graded seal needed between the window and the rest of the tube. The seal is vulnerable to mechanical shocks.
* '''[[Magnesium fluoride]]''' transmits ultraviolet down to 115&amp;nbsp;nm. [[Hygroscopic]], though less than other alkali halides usable for UV windows.

==Usage considerations==
Photomultiplier tubes typically utilize 1000 to 2000 [[volts]] to accelerate electrons within the chain of dynodes. (See Figure near top of article.) The most negative voltage is connected to the cathode, and the most positive voltage is connected to the anode. Negative high-voltage supplies (with the positive terminal grounded) are often preferred, because this configuration enables the [[photocurrent]] to be measured at the low voltage side of the circuit for amplification by subsequent electronic circuits operating at low voltage. However, with the photocathode at high voltage, leakage currents sometimes result in unwanted &quot;dark current&quot; pulses that may affect the operation.  Voltages are distributed to the dynodes by a resistive [[voltage divider]], although variations such as active designs (with [[transistors]] or [[diode]]s) are possible. The divider design, which influences frequency response or [[rise time]], can be selected to suit varying applications. Some instruments that use photomultipliers have provisions to vary the anode voltage to control the gain of the system.

While powered (energized), photomultipliers must be shielded from ambient light to prevent their destruction through overexcitation. In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the photomultiplier compartment is opened. Another option is to add overcurrent protection in the external circuit, so that when the measured anode current exceeds a safe limit, the high voltage is reduced.

If used in a location with strong [[magnetic field]]s, which can curve electron paths, steer the electrons away from the dynodes and cause loss of gain, photomultipliers are usually magnetically shielded by a layer of soft iron or [[mu-metal]]. This magnetic shield is often maintained at cathode potential. When this is the case, the external shield must also be electrically insulated because of the high voltage on it. Photomultipliers with large distances between the photocathode and the first dynode are especially sensitive to magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmt&quot;/&gt;

==Typical applications==
* Photomultipliers were the first [[electric eye]] devices, being used to measure interruptions in beams of light.
* Photomultipliers are used in conjunction with [[scintillator]]s to detect [[Ionizing radiation]] by means of hand held and fixed radiation protection instruments, and [[particle radiation]] in physics experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drct.com/probes/HP-265_G-M_pancake_probe.htm Photomultiplier Tubes Used in Radiation Detection]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Photomultipliers are used in research laboratories to measure the intensity and spectrum of light-emitting materials such as [[compound semiconductor]]s and [[quantum dots]].
* Photomultipliers are used as the detector in many [[Spectrophotometry|spectrophotometers]]. This allows an instrument design that escapes the [[#High_sensitivity_applications|thermal noise limit on sensitivity]], and which can therefore substantially increase the dynamic range of the instrument.
* Photomultipliers are used in numerous medical equipment designs. For example:
** [[blood analysis]] devices used by clinical medical laboratories, such as [[Flow cytometry|flow cytometers]], utilize photomultipliers to determine the relative concentration of various components in blood samples, in combination with [[optical filter]]s and [[incandescent lamps]].
** an array of photomultipliers is used in a [[Gamma camera]]
* Photomultipliers are typically used as the detectors in [[Flying-spot scanner]]s.

==High sensitivity applications==
After fifty years, during which [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] electronic components have largely displaced the vacuum tube, the photomultiplier remains a unique and important optoelectronic component. Perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts, electronically, as a nearly perfect current source owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals. There is no [[Johnson noise]] associated with photomultiplier signal currents even though they are greatly amplified, e.g., by 100 thousand times (i.e., 100 dB) or more. The photocurrent still contains [[shot noise]].

Photomultiplier-amplified photocurrents can be electronically amplified by a high-input-impedance electronic amplifier (in the signal path, subsequent to the photomultiplier), thus producing appreciable voltages even for nearly infinitesimally small photon fluxes. Photomultipliers offer the best possible opportunity to exceed the Johnson noise for many configurations. The aforementioned refers to measurement of light fluxes that, while small, nonetheless amount to a continuous stream of multiple photons.

For smaller photon fluxes, the photomultiplier can be operated in photon counting or [[Geiger counter|Geiger]] mode (''see also: [[Single-Photon Avalanche Diode|single-photon avalanche diode]]''). In Geiger mode the photomultiplier gain is set so high (using high voltage) that a single photo-electron resulting from a single photon incident on the primary surface generates a very large current at the output circuit. However, owing to the avalanche of current, a reset of the photomultiplier is required. In either case, the photomultiplier can detect individual photons. The drawback, however, is that not every photon incident on the primary surface is counted either because of less-than-perfect efficiency of the photomultiplier, or because a second photon can arrive at the photomultiplier during the &quot;[[dead time]]&quot; associated with a first photon and never be noticed.

A photomultiplier will produce a small current even without incident photons; this is called the [[Dark current (physics)|''dark current'']]. Photon counting applications generally demand photomultipliers designed to minimise dark current.

Nonetheless, the ability to detect single photons striking the primary photosensitive surface itself reveals the quantization principle that [[Albert Einstein#Photons and energy quanta|Einstein put forth]]. Photon-counting (as it is called) reveals that light, not only being a wave, consists of discrete particles (i.e., [[photon]]s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6406">'''Aquadag''' is a trade name for a water-based [[colloidal]] [[graphite]] coating commonly used in [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs).  It is manufactured by [[Acheson Industries]], a subsidiary of [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]]. The name is a shortened form of &quot;Aqueous Deflocculated Acheson Graphite&quot;, but has become a generic term for conductive graphite coatings used in vacuum tubes. Other related products include Oildag, Electrodag and Molydag. The product names are often printed with DAG in upper case (e.g. AquaDAG).  It is used as an electrically conductive coating on insulating surfaces, and as a lubricant.

==Properties==

Aquadag consists of a dispersion of colloidal graphite in distilled water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agar&quot;&gt;{{cite web

It can be applied by brushing, swabbing, spraying, or dipping, after which the surface is dried, leaving a layer of pure graphite.

After drying the coating is electrically conductive.  Its resistance and other electrical properties vary with degree of dilution and application method.  When diluted 1:1 and applied by brush its resistance is:
:Air dried                ~800 ohms per square
:Heated to 200°C          ~500 ohms per square
:Heated to 300°C          ~20-30 ohms per square

==Use in cathode ray tubes==
A conductive aquadag coating applied to the inside of the glass envelope of [[cathode ray tube]]s, serves as a high voltage electrode.    The coating covers the inside walls of the &quot;bell&quot; of the CRT tube, from just inside the neck, and stops just short of the screen.   Due to the graphite it is electrically conductive, and forms part of the high voltage positive [[electrode]], the second [[anode]], which accelerates the electron beam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bali&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second anode is a metal cylinder inside the neck of the tube, connected to a high positive voltage of 18 to 25&amp;nbsp;kilovolts.  It has spring clips which press against the walls of the tube, making contact with the aquadag coating so it also carries this high positive voltage.  The [[electron beam]] from the [[electron gun]] in the neck of the tube is accelerated by the high voltage on the anode and passes through it to strike the screen.

The aquadag coating has two functions: it maintains a uniform electric field inside the tube near the screen, so the electron beam remains collimated and is not distorted by external fields, and it collects the electrons after they have hit the screen, serving as the return path for the cathode current.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avison&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   When the electron beam hits the screen, in addition to causing the [[fluorescent]] [[phosphor]] coating to give off light, it also knocks other electrons out of the surface.  These ''[[secondary electrons]]'' are attracted to the high positive voltage of the coating and return through it to the anode power supply.  Without the coating a negative space charge would develop near the screen, deflecting the electron beam.  A typical value of beam current collected by the anode coating is 0.6 mA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gulati&quot; /&gt;

In some CRTs the aquadag coating performs a third function, as a [[filter capacitor]] for the high voltage anode supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bali&quot; /&gt;  A second conductive coating is applied to part of the outside of the tube facing the inside coating.  This outside coating is connected to the ground side of the anode supply, thus the full anode voltage is applied between the coatings.   The sandwich of the two coatings separated by the [[dielectric]] glass wall of the tube form a final [[capacitor]] to filter out ripple from the anode supply.  Although the capacitance is small, around 500&amp;nbsp;pF,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bali&quot; /&gt; due to the low anode current it is sufficient to act as a filter capacitor.

In the television tube manufacturing industry, the manufacturing step which applies the aquadag is called &quot;dagging&quot;.

==Other uses==
Aside from its use in the production of CRTs, Aquadag is used in many types of high-voltage lab apparatus where a conductive coating is needed on an insulating surface.  The surfaces of some metals (most notably aluminum) can develop nonconductive oxide layers which tend to disrupt the electrostatic field produced around the surface of the metal when used as an electrode.  Aquadag is not subject to such effects, and provides a completely uniform equipotential surface for electrostatics.

[[File:Heathkit GD-18 Grid Dip Meters.agr.jpg|thumb|Two [[Heathkit]] Grid Dip Meters with a set of tuning coils.]]
'''Grid dip oscillator''' ('''GDO'''), also called '''grid dip meter''', '''dip meter''', '''dipmeter''', or just '''dipper''', is a [[measuring instrument]] to measure [[resonant frequency]] of [[radio frequency]] circuits. It measures the amount of absorption of a [[high frequency]] inductively coupled magnetic field by nearby objects.  It is an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] whose amplitude changes when near a resonant circuit which is tuned to the frequency the oscillator generates.    At the heart of the instrument is a tunable [[LC circuit]] with a coil that serves as a loose inductive coupling to the measured LC [[resonant circuit]].  Resonance is indicated by a dip in the meter indicator on the device, usually based on a [[microammeter]].

== History ==
Grid dip oscillators were first developed in the 1920s, and were built with [[vacuum tube]]s.  The devices measured the value of the tube's [[control grid|grid]] current.  Modern grid dip oscillators are [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] devices and are more versatile.  Solid-state versions of the grid dip oscillator are sometimes called '''gate dip oscillators''' or '''emitter dip oscillators''' in reference to the parts of the [[semiconductor]] whose current is being measured instead of the grid current on a vacuum tube.

== Principle of operation ==
[[Image:Gate-dip-oscillator-schematic.png|thumb|left|Oscillator portion of the schematic]]
Central to the circuit is a [[variable frequency oscillator]] with interchangeable coil and [[tuning capacitor]]s (ganged) as shown. When the oscillator's coil is in the vicinity of another resonant circuit, the pair behaves as a low Q [[transformer]], especially if the respective resonant frequencies match; this affects the frequency and amplitude of oscillation of the GDO, which is sensed in any of several ways, the simplest of which is to attach an [[ammeter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historical_schematic&quot;&gt;http://www.jumpjet.info/Pioneering-Wireless/eJournals/RCA/1961-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Grid dip oscillators have been widely used by [[amateur radio operator]]s for measuring the properties of resonant circuits, filters, and [[antenna (radio)|antennas]].

It has found wide use in tube radios and early [[guitar amplifiers]] (of the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] Champ type).  It is virtually identical, electrically, to the older four-pin type 80 tube, but with an [[octal]] [[valve base|base]]. 5Y3G, 5Y3GT, and 5Y3WGTA are variants with essentially the same specification;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/static/web05.htm National Valve Museum, equivalents beginning &quot;5&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; the 6087 is similar and a plug-in replacement, but with indirectly heated cathode.

RCA and other manufacturers later introduced many similar 5V rectifier tubes of both higher and lower current and voltage rating, including the 5V3, 5W3, 5X3, 5Z3, 5U4, 5Z4, GZ32, and GZ34.

As for a suitable replacement, the 5Y4G has same specifications as the 5Y3G but with a different pin out.

[[Sovtek]] in Russia manufacture a 5Y3GT with similar specifications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svetlana.com/ProductHighLight.aspx?ProId=155 New Sensor: brief Sovtek 5Y3GT specification. Filament current misprinted; actually 2A.]&lt;/ref&gt; but indirectly heated, and with higher maximum current at 140 instead of 120&amp;nbsp;mA.  It is reported that the voltage drop across the Sovtek version is much lower than the original tubes, leading to undesirably high voltage output from circuits designed for the original. There have been reports of at least one batch of Sovtek 5Y3 appearing to be unreliable and prone to early failure due to arcing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diyaudio.com/forums/tubes-valves/90079-sovtek-5y3-issues.html diyaudio discussion on current vacuum tubes and reliability of Sovtek tubes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000 each year the &quot;European Triode Festival&quot; (ETF) has been held in various venues in [[Europe]] (the first three events were called &quot;Aarhus Triode Festival&quot; aka &quot;ATF&quot;). The ETF focuses on [[do-it-yourself]] audio [[valve amplifier]]s using [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]]s, and brings together some 100 [[High-end audio|high end]] vacuum tube [[audiophile]]s from all over the world (from as far away as [[Finland]] and [[New Zealand]]). At the Festival participants demonstrate their (all home-built) equipment (analogue/digital/amps/speakers/etc.) and discuss all aspects of high-end vacuum tube sound reproduction. It's a private venture of audio lovers; commercial activities are not allowed.

For the first 3 years, the festival was organised by Kurt Steffensen and held in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]]. During the next 3 years, Christian Rintelen and Wolfgang Braun organised the festival and held it in [[Langenargen]], [[Germany]].  In 2006 and 2007 Guido Tent and Emile Sprenger organized the Festival in The Beukenhof, a former monastery in Biezenmortel, The Netherlands. In 2008 Guido teamed up with Arend-Jan Wijtzes and Rob Hubertse to organize the final Dutch edition and in 2009 the festival moved to Stella-Plage, France. During the 4 days of the Festival, several seminars, workshops, shootouts and musical performances are organised.
 
Previous seminar speakers have included people like Jean Hiraga, Morgan Jones, Lynn Olson, Per Lundahl (Lundahl Transformers), Brian Sowter (Sowter Transformers of [[England]]), Steve Bench, Guido Tent (Tentlabs), Allen Wright (VSE), Peter van Willenswaard of [[Stereophile]] magazine, Pieter Treurniet (Tribute Transformers) and John Broskie (GlassWare and Tube CAD Journal).
 
Previous workshops have included subjects such as [[power supply|power supplies]] (shunt/series/passive/regulated), the sound of [[Harmonic distortion|distortion]], noise and hum, [[Audio crossover|speaker crossover]]s and digital jitter. Audio gear listening competitions are held for items such as phono stages, full range [[Loudspeaker|speakers]], [[single-ended triode]] amplifiers and output [[transformer]]s.
 
ETFs have been reviewed in several magazines, including Revue du Son, MJ, TNT Audio, 6Moons and Prestige Audio Video.
 
A recurring item with each Festival is a Special Guest that is invited to join the Festival and hold a presentation about a high-end audio subject of their own choice.

'''Ultra-linear''' electronic circuits are those used to couple a [[tetrode]] or [[pentode]] vacuum tube (also called &quot;electron valve&quot;) to a load (e.g. to a [[loudspeaker]]).

'Ultra-linear' is a special case of 'distributed-loading'; a circuit technique patented by [[Alan Blumlein]] in 1937 (Patent No. 496,883), although the name 'distributed-loading' is probably due to [[Mullard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mullard Ltd. year=1959 |title=[[Mullard Circuits for Audio Amplifiers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 he applied for the US patent 2218902. The particular advantages of ultra-linear operation, and the name itself, were published by [[David Hafler]] and Herbert Keroes in the early 1950s through articles in the magazine &quot;Audio Engineering&quot; from the USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;AudioEngineering&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last1=Hafler |first1=David |last2=Keroes |first2=Herbert I |date=November 1951 |title=An Ultra-Linear Amplifier |journal=Audio Engineering |pages=15–17 |url=http://www.aikenamps.com/images/Documents/UL.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.tubecad.com/Classic_Articles/page2.html |archivedate=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The special case of 'ultra-linear' operation falls under the more general principle of 'distributed-loading'.

==Operation==
A [[pentode]] or [[tetrode]] vacuum tube (electron valve) configured as a common-cathode amplifier (where the output signal appears on the plate) may be operated as:

* a pentode or tetrode, in which the screen grid is connected to a stable DC voltage so there are no signal variations on the screen grid (i.e. the screen grid has 0% of the plate's output signal impressed on it), or
* a triode, in which the screen grid is connected to the plate (i.e. the screen grid has 100% of the plate's output signal voltage impressed on it), or
* a blend of triode and pentode, in which the screen grid has a percentage (between 0% and 100%) of the plate's output signal impressed on it. This is the basis of the ultra-linear circuit, and is usually achieved by incorporating a suitable &quot;tap&quot; on the primary winding of the output transformer that the vacuum tube (electron valve) is connected to.

The impression of any portion of the output signal onto the screen grid (load distribution) can be seen as a form of feedback, which alters the behavior of the electron stream passing from cathode to anode. Among other benefits, this feedback helps to more accurately reflect the instantaneous reactance of the load (secondary circuit) back to the valves (primary circuit), thus offering better load-control and responsiveness (i.e. improved loudspeaker damping and power stability as load impedance varies across frequency band).

==Advantages==
By judicious choice of the screen tap percentage, the benefits of both triode and pentode vacuum tubes can be realised. Over a very narrow range of tap percentage, distortion is found to fall to an unusually low value&amp;mdash;sometimes less than for either triode or pentode operation&lt;ref name=&quot;AudioEngineering&quot;/&gt;&amp;mdash;while power efficiency is only slightly reduced, compared with full pentode operation. The optimum percentage tap to achieve ultra-linear operation depends mainly on the type of valve used; a commonly seen percentage is 43% (of the number of transformer primary turns on the plate circuit) which applies to the KT88, although many other valve types have optimum values close to this. A value of 20% was recommended for 6V6GTs. [[Mullard]] circuits such as the [[Mullard 5-10|5-20]] also used 20% distributed-loading (but did not achieve ultra-linear operation), while [[LEAK]] amplifiers used 50%).

The characteristics of the circuit which make distributed-loading suitable for audio power amplifiers, when compared to a tetrode or pentode amplifier, are:

* The output impedance is lowered to be about two to three times that achieved with a triode.
* Distortion is lowered to approach that achieved in triode operation, but may be even less in ultra-linear operation.
* The power output is higher than from a triode, approaching that delivered by a pentode.
* The power output is more constant, as distributed-loading is a combination of a transconductance amplifier and a voltage amplifier.

The distributed-load circuit may be applied to either push-pull or single-ended amplifier circuits.

Note that the term 'ultra-linear' was expressly reserved only for the condition of optimum tapping point. As Hafler and Keroes wrote:
&quot;''Our patent claims cover the use of any primary tap in this circuit arrangement. However, we have restricted the use of the term &quot;Ultra-Linear&quot; to the conditions where the dynamic plate characteristic curves are most linear''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Hafler |first1=David |last2=Keroes |first2=Herbert I. |date=September 1952 |title=Ungilding the Lily (letter) |journal=Audio Engineering |page=8 |url=http://dalmura.com.au/projects/Gilding%20the%20Lily%20-%20July%201952%20-%20Audio.pdf |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;!--Page 5 of PDF--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related circuits==
The &quot;QUAD II&quot; amplifier from [[QUAD]] uses a circuit in which the cathode has a portion of the output signal applied to it, and was referred to as &quot;distributed-load&quot; by Peter Walker of QUAD. In the United States, [[McIntosh Laboratories]] used this technique extensively in their vacuum tube power amplifiers. [[Audio Research Corp]] have also used a similar circuit.

A '''phototube''' or photoelectric cell is a type of [[gas filled tube|gas-filled]] or [[vacuum tube]] that is sensitive to light.  Such a tube is more correctly called a 'photoemissive cell' to distinguish it from [[photovoltaic]] or [[photoconductive]] cells.  Phototubes were previously more widely used but are now replaced in many applications by solid state photodetectors.    The [[photomultiplier tube]] is one of the most sensitive light detectors, and is still widely used in physics research.

==Operating principles==
Phototubes operate according to the [[photoelectric effect]]: Incoming [[photon]]s strike a [[photocathode]], knocking [[electron]]s out of its surface, which are attracted to an [[anode]]. Thus current is dependent on the frequency and intensity of incoming photons. Unlike [[photomultiplier]] tubes, no amplification takes place, so the current through the device is typically of the order of a few [[microampere]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.du.edu/~etuttle/electron/elect30.htm |title=Electronics 30 - Phototubes |author=J.B. Calvert |publisher=[[University of Denver]] |date=2002-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The light wavelength range over which the device is sensitive depends on the material used for the photoemissive cathode. A [[caesium]]-[[antimony]] cathode gives a device that is very sensitive in the violet to ultra-violet region with sensitivity falling off to blindness to red light.  Caesium on oxidised [[silver]] gives a cathode that is most sensitive to infra-red to red light, falling off towards blue, where the sensitivity is low but not zero.&lt;ref&gt;''Mullard Technical Handbook'' Volume 4 Section 4:Photoemissive Cells (1960 Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacuum devices have a near constant anode current for a given level of illumination relative to anode voltage.  Gas filled devices are more sensitive but the frequency response to modulated illumination falls off at lower frequencies compared to the vacuum devices.  The frequency response of vacuum devices is generally limited by the transit time of the electrons from cathode to anode. &lt;!-- From previous citation ---&gt;

==Applications==
One major application of the phototube was the reading of optical [[Sound film|sound tracks]] for projected films. Phototubes were used in a variety of light-sensing applications until they were superseded by [[photoresistor]]s and [[photodiode]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="342161">This is a '''list of [[vacuum tube]]s''' or ''thermionic valves'', and low-pressure [[gas-filled tube]]s, or ''discharge tubes''. Before the advent of [[semiconductor]] devices, thousands of tube types were used in consumer and industrial electronics; today only a few types are still used in specialized applications.

==Heater or filament ratings==
{{main|Hot cathode}}
Vacuum tubes fall into three mainly non-interchangeable categories regarding their heater or filament voltage (some tubes' heaters run at a voltage and current suitable for either series or parallel operation, e.g., 6.3&amp;nbsp;V at 300&amp;nbsp;mA).
# Battery types, with a low-power filament operated usually from 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;V; all filaments in a design are rated at the same voltage and are connected in parallel. They are usually directly heated to save heating power (therefore requiring a [[Direct current|DC]] current), except if the (due to the voltage [[gradient]] along the filament) poorly defined cathode potential impedes the function of the device, as is the case e.g. with AM [[Detector (radio)|detector]] diodes with filament voltages of 1.9&amp;nbsp;V or more.
#* 1.25&amp;nbsp;V for one [[Nickel–cadmium battery|NiCd cell]]
#* 1.4&amp;nbsp;V for one [[Leclanché cell]], later for one [[dry cell]]
#* 1.7 to 1.9&amp;nbsp;V for one [[Lead–acid battery|lead-acid cell]] with a variable filament resistor ({{lang-de|[[Wiktionary:heizen|Heiz]][[Wiktionary:regeln|regler]]}})
#* 2&amp;nbsp;V for one lead-acid cell
#* 2.5&amp;nbsp;V for two NiCd cells
#* 4&amp;nbsp;V for two lead-acid cells
# Types for [[Alternating current|AC]]-only equipment with a mains transformer, or for [[Vehicle audio|car radios]]; all tube heaters are rated at the same voltage and fed in parallel from a transformer winding or from the car battery, usually 6.3V (domestic AC-only, and 6V car radios) or 12.6V (mainly 12V car radios). Most are indirectly heated.
# Types for equipment designed to run on either AC or DC mains power ([[AC/DC receiver design#Series tube heaters|ac/dc]]) with no mains transformer; all heaters are connected in series, possibly with an additional [[Electrical ballast#Self-variable resistors|ballast tube]] ([[Iron-hydrogen resistor|barretter]]) or power resistor chosen so that the sum of the heater and ballast voltages equals the mains voltage. All tubes must be rated at the same heater current, typically 100, 150, 300 or 450&amp;nbsp;mA. They are always indirectly heated.

The currents drawn by parallel-connected types, and the voltages across series-connected types, vary widely according to the tube's heating power requirements. Otherwise identical tubes were manufactured in several variants with different heater characteristics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/other/docs/Tomer_1960_Getting_the_Most_Out_of_Vacuum_Tubes.pdf |last=Tomer |first=Robert B. |publisher=Howard W. Sams Co., Indianapolis |year=1960 |title=Getting the Most out of Vacuum Tubes |lccn=60-13843 |format=PDF |accessdate=10 Oct 2013}} - Chapter 6 discusses heater voltages as one of the many factors leading to proliferation of tube types.&lt;/ref&gt; (but usually the same power, e.g. 6.3&amp;nbsp;V/300&amp;nbsp;mA and 12.6&amp;nbsp;V/150&amp;nbsp;mA). See, for example, the [[#RCARC|RCA Receiving Tube Manuals]].

In ''half-indirectly'' heated tubes the cathode and one side of the filament share the same pin.

====RETMA receiving tubes system (1953)====

{{main|RETMA tube designation}}
'''RETMA''' is the acronym for the ''Radio Electronic Television Manufacturers Association'', originally the ''RMA'', later ''RTMA'', then ''[[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]'' (''Electronic Industries Association'', since 1997 ''Electronic Industries Alliance'').
* The first character group is always a number, consisting of one to three numerals, and very often represents the heater voltage to the nearest whole number - exceptions including 2.0 Volt filament tubes (such as 1C7-G and 1F4) and series heater tubes where the rounding was less exact (such as the 5.9-Volt 5X9 and the 46-Volt 50Y7GT).
* These numerals are followed by one or two letters assigned to the devices in some sort of semi-chronological order of development and introduction to the marketplace,
* and then another single numeral that represents the number of active elements in the tube (including any internal shield plus the heater in indirectly heated tubes - electrodes connected together internally count as one). For example, a 7 could mean a heptode (''[[pentagrid converter]]'') such as the 12SA7-GT, or a pentode with two diodes such as the 7E7, or with one diode and a shield pin such as the 12SF7, or triode with two diodes and a shield pin such as the 6SR7, or a twin-input triode such as the 6AE7-GT, or a double triode such as the 6SN7-GT. Exceptions include the 35L6-GT (with 5 elements, but named for consistency with the 6L6/6L6-G where pin 1 may or may not be connected to a shield, making the sixth element).
* Sometimes a string of up to three Roman letters can be suffixed to the overall number; these generally distinguish various revisions and improvements to the original model or different bulb shapes; use is unsystematic, except that for octal tubes G often indicated a shouldered glass envelope, GT a tubular glass envelope, and neither of these often a metal envelope. When discussing a type in general the letters are often omitted; discussion of the properties of the 6SN7 would tacitly include the 6SN7GT, 6SN7GTB, etc., but not the comparable 6SL7 family. By and large tubes with the same basic designation are interchangeable unless the qualities of an enhanced version are required.
* Lastly, manufacturers may decide to combine two type numbers into a single name, which their one device can replace, such as: 6DX8/ECL84 (6DX8 and ECL84 being identical devices under different naming schemes) or 6BC5/6CE5 (sufficiently identical devices within the RETMA naming system) and even 3A3/3B2, or 6AC5-GT/6AC5-G (where the single type number, 6AC5-GT/6AC5-G, supersedes both the 6AC5-G and the 6AC5-GT).

Often, but not always, vacuum tube designations that differed only in their initial numerals would be identical except for heater characteristics. Exceptions include: the 12BR7 and 9BR7 are unrelated to the 6BR7; the 4BL8/XCF80 is the 4.6 Volt (600mA series heater) version of the 6BL8/ECF80, but the 450mA series heater version is the 6LN8/LCF80 rather than 6BL8.

For '''examples''' [[#List of American RETMA tubes, with European equivalents|see below]]

====EIA professional tubes system====

A four-digit system was maintained by the [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]] for special industrial, military and professional vacuum and gas-filled tubes, and all sorts of other devices requiring to be sealed off against the external atmosphere.

Some manufacterers preceded the EIA number with a manufacterer's code:
*'''CK''' [[Raytheon]] Company
*'''GL''' [[General Electric]] Corp.
*'''F''' [[Federal Telegraph Company|Federal Telephone and Radio]] ([[ITT Corporation|ITT]] division)
*'''ML''' [[Machlett Laboratories]], Inc.
*'''NL''' National Electronics, Inc. (Geneva, Illinois, USA)
*'''NU''' National Union Electric Corp. (Orange, New Jersey, USA)
*'''PL''' [[Philips]] N.V.
*'''SV''' Svetlana:
**formerly only ''[[Open joint-stock company|JSC]] &quot;Svetlana&quot;'' ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:Светлана (компания)|ОАО &quot;Светлана&quot;]]}}), St. Petersburg, Russia
**now also a brand of ''[[Sovtek|New Sensor]] Corp.'', Long Island City, New York, USA, manufacturing in Saratov, Russia
*'''SY''' [[Standard Telephones and Cables]] Ltd./Brimar ('''not''' [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] Inc.)
*'''WL''' [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] Corp.

===West European systems===

====Mullard-Philips system====
{{main|Mullard-Philips tube designation}}
This system is very descriptive of what type of device (triode, diode, pentode etc.) it is applied to, as well as the heater/filament type and the base type (octal, noval, etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;TypeDesignationCode1967&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tubedata.info/other/TypeDesignationCode1967.pdf |title= Preferred Types of Electron Tubes 1967|format=PDF |accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adhering manufacturers include [[AEG]]&amp;nbsp;(de), [[Amperex Electronic|Amperex]]&amp;nbsp;(us), Dario&amp;nbsp;(fr), La&amp;nbsp;Radiotechnique&amp;nbsp;(fr), [[C. Lorenz AG|Lorenz]]&amp;nbsp;(de), [[Mullard]]&amp;nbsp;(uk), [[Philips]]&amp;nbsp;(nl), [[RCA]]&amp;nbsp;(us), RFT&amp;nbsp;(de), [[Siemens]]&amp;nbsp;(de), [[Telefunken]]&amp;nbsp;(de), [[Toshiba]]&amp;nbsp;(ja), [[Tungsram]]&amp;nbsp;(hu) and [[Valvo]]&amp;nbsp;(de).

=====Standard tubes=====
This part dates back to the joint valve code key ({{lang-de|[[Wiktionary:Röhre|Röhren]]-[[Wiktionary:Gemeinschaft|Gemeinschaft]]s[[Wiktionary:Schlüssel|schlüssel]]}}) negotiated between Philips and Telefunken in 1933-34. Like the North American system the first symbol describes the heater voltage, in this case a Roman letter rather than a number. Further Roman letters, up to three, describe the device followed by one to four numerals assigned in a semi-chronological order of type development within number ranges assigned to different base types.

If two devices share the same type designation other than the first letter (e.g. ECL82, PCL82, UCL82) they will usually be identical except for heater specifications; however there are exceptions, particularly with output types (for example, both the PL84 and UL84 differ significantly from the EL84 in certain major characteristics, although they have the same pinout and similar power rating). However, device numbers do not reveal any similarity between different type families; e.g. the triode section of an ECL82 is not related to either triode of an ECC82, whereas the triode section of an ECL86 does happen to be similar to those of an ECC83.

''[[Pro Electron]]'' maintained a [[subset]] of the M-P system after their establishment in 1966, with only the first letters '''E''', '''P''' for the heater, only the second letters '''A''', '''B''', '''C''', '''D''', '''E''', '''F''', '''H''', '''K''', '''L''', '''M''', '''Y''', '''Z''' for the type, and issuing only three-digit numbers starting with [[#SQ0000|'''1''', '''2''', '''3''', '''5''', '''8''', '''9''']] for the base.&lt;ref name=&quot;PE-D15-2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://material.htlwien10.at/wissensspeicher/Halbleiterkennzeichnungen/European_Type_Designation_Code-Sstem_for_Electronic_Components_PE-D15-2008_Pro-Electron.pdf |publisher=[[Pro Electron|Pro-Electron]], Brussels, Belgium |date=June 2008 |title=European Type Designation Code System for Electronic Components |edition=15 |format=PDF |accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes''': [[Tungsram]] preceded the M-P designation with the letter '''T''', as in TAD1 for AD1; ''Vatea'' (United Incandescent Lamp and Electric Company, Budapest, Hungary) preceded the M-P designation with the letter '''V''', as in VEL5 for EL5.

====={{anchor|MP_SQ}}Special quality tubes=====
Vacuum tubes which had special qualities ({{lang-fr|[[Wiktionary:sécurité|Securité]] - [[Wiktionary:qualité|Qualité]]}}) of some sort, very often long-life designs, particularly for [[computer]] and [[telecommunication]]s use, had the numeric part of the designation placed immediately after the first letter. They were usually special-quality versions of standard types. Thus the E82CC was a long-life version of the ECC82 intended for computer and general signal use, and the E88CC a high quality version of the ECC88/6DJ8. While the E80F pentode was a high quality development of the EF80, they were not pin-compatible and could not be interchanged without rewiring the socket (the E80F is commonly sought after as a high quality replacement for the similar EF86 type in guitar amplifiers). The letters &quot;CC&quot; indicated the two triodes and the &quot;F&quot;, the single pentode inside these types.

A few special-quality tubes did not have a standard equivalent, e.g. the E55L, a broadband power pentode used as the output stage of [[oscilloscope]] amplifiers and the E90CC, a double triode with a common cathode connection and seven pin base for use in cathode-coupled [[Flip-flop (electronics)|Flip-flops]] in early computers. The E91H is a special heptode with a passivated third grid designed to reduce secondary emission; this device was used as a &quot;gate&quot;, allowing or blocking pulses applied to the first, ([[Control grid|control]]) grid by changing the voltage on the third grid, in early computer circuits (similar in function to the U.S. 6AS6).

Many of these types had gold-plated base pins and special heater configurations inside the nickel cathode tube designed to reduce hum pickup from the A.C. heater supply, and also had improved oxide insulation between the heater and cathode so the cathode could be elevated to a greater voltage above the heater supply. (Note that ''elevating'' the cathode voltage ''above'' the average heater voltage, which in well-designed equipment was supplied from a transformer with an earthed center-tapped secondary, was less detrimental to the oxide insulation between heater and cathode than ''lowering'' the cathode voltage ''below'' the heater voltage, helping to prevent pyrometallurgical electrolytic chemical reactions where the oxide touched the nickel cathode that could form conductive aluminium tungstate and which could ultimately develop into a heater-cathode short-circuit.)

Better, often dual, [[getter]]s were implemented to maintain a better vacuum, and more-rigid electrode supports introduced to reduce [[microphonics]] and improve vibration and shock resistance. The mica spacers used in &quot;SQ&quot; and &quot;PQ&quot; types did not possess sharp protrusions which could flake off and become loose inside the bulb, possibly lodging between the grids and thus changing the characteristics of the device. Some types, particularly the E80F, E88CC and E90CC, had a constricted section of bulb to firmly hold specially shaped flakeless mica spacers.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Miniwatt&quot; Premium Quality and Special Purpose Tubes, Philips Electrical Industries Pty.

===Russian systems===

{{main|Russian tube designations}}

Vacuum tubes produced in the former Soviet Union and in present-day Russia are designated in Cyrillic. Some confusion has been created in transliterating these designations to Latin.

===={{anchor|RuCS}}Standard tubes====
In the 1950s a 5-element system ([[GOST]] 5461-59, later 13393-76) was adopted in the (then) Soviet Union for designating receiver vacuum tubes.

The '''1st element''' is a number specifying filament voltage in volts (rounded off to the nearest whole number), or, for cathode-ray tubes, the screen diagonal or diameter in cm (rounded-off to the nearest whole number).

The '''2nd element is''' a Cyrillic character specifying the type of device:
*'''D''' (Russian: '''Д''') - Diode, including damper diodes
*'''H''' (Russian: '''Х''') - Double diode
*'''Ts''' (Russian: '''Ц''') - Low-power rectifier ([[kenotron]])
*'''S''' (Russian: '''С''') - [[Triode]]
*'''N''' (Russian: '''Н''') - Double triode
*'''E''' (Russian: '''Э''') - [[Tetrode]]
*'''P''' (Russian: '''П''') - Output [[pentode]], or a [[beam tetrode]]
*'''Zh''' (Russian: '''Ж''') - Sharp-[[Cut-off (electronics)|cutoff]] [[pentode]] (also transliterated sh or j)
*'''K''' (Russian: '''К''') - Variable-[[Control grid#Grid variations|mu]] / remote-cutoff [[pentode]]
*'''R''' (Russian: '''Р''') - Double [[pentode]] or a double [[tetrode]]
*'''G''' (Russian: '''Г''') - Combined triode-diode
*'''B''' (Russian: '''Б''') - Combined diode-pentode
*'''F''' (Russian: '''Ф''') - Combined triode-pentode
*'''I''' (Russian: '''И''') - Combined triode-hexode, triode-heptode or triode-octode
*'''A''' (Russian: '''А''') - [[Pentagrid converter]]
*'''V''' (Russian: '''В''') - Vacuum tube with secondary emission
*'''L''' (Russian: '''Л''') - [[Cathode-ray tube]]
*'''Ye''' (Russian: '''Е''') - [[Magic eye tube|Optical tuning/level indicator]]

The '''3rd element''' is a number - a series designator that distinguishes between different devices of the same type.

The '''4th element''' denotes vacuum tube construction (base, envelope):
*'''&lt;none&gt;''' - All-metal tube
*'''P''' (Russian: '''П''') - Small 9-pin or 7-pin glass envelope (22.5 or 19&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter)
*'''A''' (Russian: '''А''') - Subminiature glass envelope (5 to 8&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) with flexible leads
*'''B''' (Russian: '''Б''') - Subminiature glass envelope (8 to 10.2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) with flexible leads
*'''S''' (Russian: '''С''') - Glass envelope (greater than 22.5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter), typically with an [[Tube socket#Octal|octal base]]
*'''N''' (Russian: '''Н''') - ''[[Nuvistor]]''
*'''K''' (Russian: '''К''') - Metal-ceramic envelope
*'''D''' (Russian: '''Д''') - Glass-metal envelope with disc connections (for [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] operation)

The '''5th element''' is optional. It consists of a dash (&quot;-&quot;) followed by a single character or a combination of characters, and denotes special characteristics (if any) of the tube:
*'''V''' (Russian: '''В''') - Increased reliability and mechanical ruggedness (such as low susceptibility to noise and [[microphonics]])
*'''R''' (Russian: '''Р''') - Even better than V
*'''Ye''' (Russian: '''Е''') - Extended service life
*'''D''' (Russian: '''Д''') - Exceptionally long service life
*'''I''' (Russian: '''И''') - Optimised for &quot;pulsed&quot; (i.e. switching) mode of operation

:'''Note:''' In most cases this means construction differences to the basic version, rather than a selection for those characteristics from the regular-quality production at the factory.

For '''examples''' [[#RuS|see below]]

===={{anchor|RuCH}}Very-high power tubes====
There is another designation system for high-power tubes such as transmitter ones.

The '''1st element''' is always G (Russian Г, for &quot;генераторная&quot; &quot;generator&quot;).

The '''2nd element''' (with some notable exceptions such as the Г807) is:
*'''K''' (Russian: '''К''') - [[Shortwave radio|Shortwave]] tube (≤25&amp;nbsp;MHz)
*'''U''' (Russian: '''У''') - [[Very high frequency|VHF]] tube (25-600&amp;nbsp;MHz)
*'''S''' (Russian: '''С''') - UHF tube (&gt;600&amp;nbsp;MHz)
*'''M''' (Russian: '''М''') - Modulator tube
*'''I''' (Russian: '''И''') - Impulse tube

The '''3rd element''' consists of a dash (&quot;-&quot;) followed by the design serial number:
*'''A''' (Russian '''А''') - Water-cooled
*'''B''' (Russian '''Б''') - Air-cooled

For '''examples''' [[#RuH|see below]]

===Very-high power tubes designation ([[Eimac|Eitel McCullough]] and derivatives)===

===Military naming systems===

====British CV naming system====

This system prefixes a three- or four-digit number with the letters &quot;CV&quot;, meaning &quot;civilian valve&quot; i.e. common to all three armed services. It was introduced during the Second World War to rationalise the previous nomenclatures maintained separately by the War Office/Ministry of Supply, Admiralty and Air Ministry/Ministry of Aircraft Production on behalf of the three armed services (e.g. &quot;ACR~&quot;, &quot;AR~&quot;, &quot;AT~&quot;, etc. for [[Cathode ray tube|CRTs]], receiving and transmitting valves used in army equipments, &quot;NC~&quot;, &quot;NR~&quot; and &quot;NT~&quot; similarly for navy equipments and &quot;VCR~&quot;, &quot;VR~&quot; and &quot;VT~&quot; etc. for air force equipments), in which three separate designations could in principle apply to the same valve (which often had at least one prototype commercial designation as well). These numbers generally have '''identical equivalents''' in both the North American, RETMA, and West European, Mullard-Philips, systems but they bear no resemblance to the assigned &quot;CV&quot; number.

'''Examples'''
*CV1986 = [[6SN7]] = ECC33
*CV4007 = SQ version of 6AL5 = E91AA
*CV4010 = SQ version of [[6AK5]] = E95F

'''Note:''' The 4000 numbers identify special-quality valves.

The principle behind the CV numbering scheme was also adopted by the US Joint Army-Navy JAN numbering scheme which was later considerably expanded into the US Federal and then [[NATO Stock Number]] system used by all NATO countries. This part-identification system ensures that every particular spare part (not merely thermionic valves) receives a unique stock number across the whole of NATO irrespective of the source, and hence is not held inefficiently as separate stores. In the case of CV valves, the stock number is always of the format 5960-99-000-XXXX where XXXX is the CV number (with a leading 0 if the CV number only has 3 digits).

====U.S. naming systems====

One system prefixes a three-digit number with the letters &quot;VT&quot;, presumably meaning &quot;Vacuum Tube&quot;. Other systems prefix the number with the letters &quot;JHS&quot; or &quot;JAN&quot;. The numbers following these prefixes can be &quot;special&quot; four-digit numbers, or domestic two- or three-digit numbers or simply the domestic North American &quot;RETMA&quot; numbering system. Like the British military system, these have many direct equivalents in the civilian types.
Confusingly, the British also had two entirely different &quot;VT&quot; nomenclatures, one used by the Royal Air Force (see the preceding section) and the other used by the [[General Post Office]], responsible for post and telecommunications at the time, where it may have stood for &quot;valve, telephone&quot;; none of these schemes corresponded in any way with each other.

'''Examples'''
*&quot;VT&quot; numbering systems
**North American '''VT90''' = '''6H6'''
**British (RAF) '''VT90''' [[Very high frequency|VHF]] Transmitting triode
**British (GPO) '''VT90''' = '''ML4''' = '''CV1732''' Power triode
**'''VT104''' RF pentode
**'''VT105''' RF triode

===Other numeral-only systems===

Various numeral-only systems exist. These tend to be used for devices used in commercial or industrial equipment.

For '''examples''', [[#List of other number tubes|see below]]

The oldest numbering systems date back to the early 1920s, such as a two-digit numbering system, starting with the ''UV-201A'', which was considered as &quot;type 01&quot;, and extended almost continuously up into the 1980s.

For '''examples''' [[#List of tubes used in 1920s and 1930s radio receivers|see below]]

Three- and four-digit numeral-only systems were maintained by [[RCA|R.C.A.]], but also adopted by many other manufacturers, and typically encompassed rectifiers and radio transmitter output devices. Devices in the low 800s tend to be transmitter output types, those in the higher 800s are not vacuum tubes, but gas-filled rectifiers and [[thyratron]]s, and those in the 900s tend to be special-purpose and high-frequency devices. Use was not rigorously systematic: the 807 had variants 1624, 1625, and 807W.

For '''examples''', see below under '''[[#800s|800s]]''', '''[[#900s|900s]]''' and '''[[#1600s|1600s]]'''

===Other letter followed by numerals===

There are quite a number of these systems from different geographical realms, such as those used on devices from contemporary Russian and Chinese production. Other compound numbering systems were used to mark higher-reliability types used in industrial or commercial applications. Computers and telecommunication equipment also required valves (tubes) of greater quality and reliability than for domestic and consumer equipment.

Some letter prefixes are manufacterer's codes:

Those marked '''FL''' have elliptical bodies and flat bases with long, inline &quot;flying leads&quot; that are soldered into the circuit. Those marked '''SL''' are similar to those marked '''FL''', but have short inline leads that can be soldered or can be mated with a special socket. (Flying leads can be cut short to fit into inline sockets.)

*'''6AD6-G''' and '''6AF6-G''' &quot;Magic Eye&quot; tuning indicators. Both have two &quot;pie wedge&quot; shadow indicators, one each on opposite sides of a single circular indicator target. Both shadows may be used in tandem or may be driven by two different signal sources. Type '''6AE6-G''' is specifically made to drive each indicator with different signals. May also be driven by separate pentodes with different characteristics. E.g., a sharp-cutoff pentode like a '''6J7''' - which would be hyper-sensitive to any signal change—would drive one shadow, while a remote-cutoff pentode like a '''6K7''' - which would only react to stronger signals—would drive the other shadow. Both tubes have octal bases. Type 6AD6-G, with a target voltage rated from 100 to 150 volt, is designed for AC/DC radios. Type 6AF6-G, with a target voltage rated at 250 volt, is designed for larger AC radios.

*'''6B7''' and '''6B8''' (''EBF32''): Double-Diode, Semiremote-cutoff Pentodes. Based on type '''2B7''' which had a 2.5 volt heater. Type 6B7 has a UX7 base with a top-cap connection for the control grid (grid 1). Type 6B8 has an octal base with a top cap. The diode plates are most commonly used as (second) detectors and AVC rectification in superheterodyne receivers. Because their control grids have both sharp-cutoff and remote-cutoff characteristics, these types were used as I.F. amplifiers with AVC bias to the control grid, and as A.F. amplifiers. These types were also used in [[reflectional receiver|reflex radios]]. In a typical 2B7/6B7/6B8 reflex circuit, the I.F. signal from the converter is injected into the pentode and is amplified. The diodes then act as detectors, separating the A.F. signal from the R.F. signal. The A.F. signal is then re-injected into the pentode, amplified, and sent to the audio output tube.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nostalgiaair.org/PagesByModel/791/M0007791.pdf Schematic for General Electric model F-40], a 1938 reflex radio using a 6B7.&lt;/ref&gt;

::*14.5 watts (push-pull Class-A circuit)
::*34 watts (push-pull Class-AB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; circuit)
::*60 watts (push-pull Class-AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; circuit)

::'''6L6''' (metal envelope) and '''6L6-G''' (shouldered glass envelope) were used in pre-World War II radios and Public Address amplifiers.
::'''6L6''' and '''25L6''' were introduced in 1935 as the first beam tetrodes. Both types were branded with the ''L6'' ending to signify their (then) uniqueness among audio output tubes. However, this is the only similarity between the two tubes. (Type '''6W6-GT''' is the 6.3 volt heater version of types '''25L6-GT''' and '''50L6-GT'''.)

:*'''6L6GA''' Post-war version of type 6L6-G, in smaller ST-14 shape with ''Shouldered Tubular'', (ST), shaped bulb, revision A.
:*'''6L6GB''' Post-war improved version in a cylindrical glass envelope. Similar to type '''5881'''.

:*'''6L6-GX''' Class-C oscillator/amplifier used in transmitters. Max. output 30 watts. (All versions may be used as a Class-C oscillator/amplifier, but this version is specifically designed for this purpose, has a special ceramic base.)
*'''6L7''' [[Pentagrid converter]] often used in console radios of the late 1930s. Similar in structure to pentode-triode pentagrid converters '''6SA7''' and '''6BE6''', except that a separate oscillator—usually type '''6C5''' - is required.

==List of European ''Mullard-Philips'' tubes, with American equivalents==
Most post-war European thermionic valve (vacuum tube) manufacturers have used the ''[[Mullard-Philips tube designation]]'' naming scheme.

Special quality variants may have the letters &quot;SQ&quot; appended, or the device description letters may be swapped with the numerals (e.g. an E82CC is a special quality version of an ECC82)

'''Note''': Typecode explained [[#Mullard-Philips system|above]]. The part behind a slash (&quot;/&quot;) is the [[#RMA system (1942)|RMA]]/[[#RETMA receiving tubes system (1953)|RETMA]]/[[#EIA special devices system|EIA]] equivalent.

The anode acted only as a small-signal amplified/gated-sync output which was added to the feedback from an auxiliary winding on the deflection yoke, and fed to the [[control grid]]. As there was no vertical deflection output transformer, another winding on the deflection yoke received a constant current to compensate for the DC component of the screen grid current; it was variable to adjust the picture position on the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] screen. The screen grid delivered enough power even for an EHT winding on the horizontal deflection output transformer and for the 6.3V/0.2A heater of an RFG5 16-kV EHT rectifier.&lt;ref name=&quot;FoFu1940&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=[[:de:Hanns Günther|Günther, Hanns]]; [[:de:Heinz Richter (Ingenieur)|Richter, Ing.

(By comparison, the two AC triodes introduced in the same time period—types 26 and 27—had amplification factors of 8.3 and 9, respectively.) Because this was the highest-amplification triode available, advertising literature of the time lists it as a high-mu triode, although it is now classified as a medium-mu triode. Type 40 had the highest amplification factor of any triode until the introduction in 1932 of diode/triode complex type '''2A6''', which had an amplification factor of 100.

===Shielded tubes for Majestic radios===
In the early 1930s, the Grigsby-Grunow Company—makers of Majestic brand radios—introduced the first American-made tubes to incorporate metal shields. These tubes had metal particles sprayed onto the glass envelope, copying a design common to European tubes of the time. Early types were shielded versions of tube types already in use. (The shield was connected to the cathode.) The Majestic numbers of these tube types, which are usually etched on the tube's base, have a &quot;G&quot; prefix (for '''G'''rigsby-'''G'''runow) and an &quot;S&quot; suffix (for '''s'''hielded). Later types incorporated an extra pin in the base so that the shield could be connected directly to the chassis.

Replacement versions from other manufacturers, such as [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] or [[General Electric]], tend to incorporate the less expensive, form-fitting Goat brand shields that are cemented to the glass envelope.

Grigsby-Grunow did not shield rectifier tubes (except for type '''6Y5''' listed below) or power output tubes.

*'''Early types based on existing tubes.''' (Non-shielded versions may be used, but add-on shielding is recommended.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3229">The '''WD-11''' [[vacuum tube]], a [[triode]], was introduced by the [[Westinghouse Electric]] corporation in 1922 for their Aeriola RF model radio and found use in other contemporary [[regenerative receiver]]s (used as a detector-amplifier) including the Regenoflex and Radiola series.

==Drawbacks==
The WD-11's design was somewhat ill thought out, when the filament burns out it has a tendency to contact the plate, feeding high voltages back through the heater circuitry. It was replaced just a year later by higher performance tubes which were less likely to encounter this problem, Westinghouse Electric's WD-12 and [[General Electric]]'s UX-199. No radios using the WD-11 tube were designed after 1924, RCA ceased production and issued a service bulletin describing how to retrofit existing sets to use the newer UX-199 triodes.

==Collectiblity==
Because of its rarity it has become one of the most valuable vacuum tubes in the world. New-old-stock units have sold for as much as US$180 and used tubes for over $100, more than the original price radios that use them. Collectors rarely, if ever use these tubes for fear of burning them out.

==Substitution==
Sets that use the costly WD-11 and UX-199 tubes can be modified to use the 1A5/GT octal power [[pentode]] (Which cost around $2.50) by wiring a 5.1 [[ohm]] [[resistor]] between the pins of the filament and fabricating an octal-to-four pin adaptor. The pin for the 1A5's suppressor is left unconnected and the screen connected to the plate.

The type 12 (also known as RCA-12) is electrically identical to the type 11, but with a more common [[Tube socket#Early bases|UX4]] base.

A '''valve audio amplifier''' ([[UK]]) or '''vacuum tube audio amplifier''' ([[United States]]) is a [[valve amplifier]] used for [[sound reinforcement]], [[sound recording and reproduction]].

Until the invention of [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices such as the [[transistor]], all electronic amplification was produced by [[thermionic valve|valve (tube)]] amplifiers. While solid-state devices prevail in most audio amplifiers today, valve audio amplifiers are still used where their [[Valve sound|audible characteristics]] are considered pleasing, for example in music performance or music reproduction.

==Instrument and vocal amplification==
Valve amplifiers for guitars (and to a lesser degree vocals and other applications) have different purposes from those of hi-fi amplifiers. The purpose is not necessarily to reproduce sound as accurately as possible, but rather to fulfill the musician's concept of what the sound should be. For example, distortion is almost universally considered undesirable in hi-fi amplifiers but may be considered a desirable characteristic in performance.

Small signal circuits are often deliberately designed to have very high [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], driving the signal far outside the linear range of the tube circuit, to deliberately generate large amounts of harmonic distortion. The distortion and overdrive characteristics of valves are quite different from transistors (not least the amount of voltage headroom available in a typical circuit) and this results in a distinctive sound. Amplifiers for such performance applications typically retain tone and filter circuits that have largely disappeared from modern hi-fi products. Amplifiers for guitars in particular may also include a number of &quot;effects&quot; functions.

===The origins of electric guitar amplification===
The electric guitar originates from Rickenbacker in the 1930s but its modern form was popularised by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] (notably the [[Fender Telecaster]] (1951) &amp; [[Stratocaster]] (1954) and [[Gibson Les Paul]] (1952) during the 1950s. The earliest [[guitar amplifier]]s were probably audio amplifiers made for other purposes and pressed into service, but the electric guitar and its amplification quickly developed a life of its own, supported by specialist manufacturers.

[[File:Trace Elliot Bonneville rear view.jpg|thumb|300px|Rear view of a valve combo guitar amplifier. Visible are two glass 6L6 output tubes, six smaller 12AX7 preamp tubes in their metal tube retainers and both the power transformer and the output transformer.]]

Guitar amplifiers are often designed so they can, when desired by the guitarist, distort and create a tone rich in harmonics and overtones. The characteristics of the tube and the circuit directly influence the nature of the sound produced. Even the power supply can influence the tonal shape, with relatively undersized power supply capacitors producing a characteristic &quot;sag&quot; at instants of peak output and power draw, and subsequent recovery, that is often considered musically engaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ampbooks.com/home/classic-circuits/class-AB-ripple/]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, guitarists may employ acoustic feedback, further modifying the resulting sound (noting that the feedback signal has a slight time lag relative to the original signal).

Guitar amplifiers are typically designed to withstand a lot of abuse both electrically and physically (since guitarists often travel to gigs, etc.) In large systems the amplifier is separate from the speaker enclosure(s), but in smaller systems it is often integrated, forming a so-called &quot;combo&quot;. Since the amplifier is usually at the top of the combo, the tubes often hang upside down facing the body of the enclosure. They may be held in with clips.

Most modern valve guitar amplifiers use a class AB1 push-pull circuit with a pair of power pentodes or beam tetrodes, [[6L6]] or [[EL34]] but occasionally [[KT88]], [[6550]], or the lower-power [[EL84]]  in ''[[Ultra-Linear]]'' connection. The output stage is preceded by a voltage amplification stage (pentode or twin triode) and a phase-splitter (twin triode). Twin triodes with two identical sections in one envelope are used, usually the noval types [[12AT7]], [[12AU7]], or [[12AX7]] or equivalents, less usually the octal [[6SN7]].

==Amplifiers for sound reproduction==

===Early development===
The earliest mass usage of valve audio amplifiers was for telephony. Valve amplifiers were critical in development of long-distance telephone circuits and [[submarine telephone cable]]s. Radio applications followed soon after, where valves were used for both the audio (AF) and radio (RF) circuitry. (RF is outside the scope of this article, see [[valve amplifier]]).

Among the first applications of sound recording and electronic replay around the 1920s was its use in many cinemas equipping for exhibiting the new '[[talkies]]'. Cinema sound systems of this period were predominantly supplied by &quot;Westrex&quot;, related to the Western Electric company, a telecoms supplier, who were also the makers of the 300B DHT tube that today is central to current production DH-SET audiophile amplification.

Amplifiers during this period typically used '''D'''irectly '''H'''eated tubes in a Class A '''S'''ingle-'''E'''nded '''T'''riode circuit. Power output ranged from a few watts to perhaps 20 watts for an exceptionally powerful amplifier (modern semiconductor amplifiers produce much higher power). Today this type of circuit retains a niche following at the very extreme of audiophile hi-fi, where it is often referred as DH-SET.

Prior to WWII, almost all electronic amplifiers were triodes used without feedback. The inherent, albeit imperfect, linearity of tubes makes it possible to get acceptable distortion performance without correction. Amplitude distortion in a class A triode stage can be small if care is taken to prevent the anode current from becoming too small and ensuring that grid current does not flow at any point. In this case, distortion is largely relatively unobjectionable second harmonic, with percentage closely proportional to the output amplitude. Adding modest negative feedback improves linearity further. Pentodes of the same power dissipation are capable of higher output power than triodes, but distortion is higher and more objectionable.

===The 1940s and 1950s===
During the post-war period, widespread adoption of [[negative feedback]] in the push pull topology yielded greater power and linearity, notably following the publication in 1947 of the [[Williamson amplifier]], which set the standard (and the dominant topology) for what was to follow.

Widespread adoption of push pull allowed smaller (and thus cheaper) transformers,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} combined with more power (typically 10 to 20 watts) to handle peaks. The [[high fidelity]] industry was born.

Other developments included (among others):
* the introduction of the &quot;Point One&quot; series of amplifiers (in 1945) by [[LEAK]] in the UK, which first set a performance standard of 0.1% THD
* the [[Ultra-Linear]] output stage (a tapped push-pull output transformer providing power intermediate between triodes and pentodes, at lower distortion than either) was originated by [[Alan Blumlein]] in 1937 in the UK, but popularised following publication of a paper by [[David Hafler]] and Keroes in the USA in 1951, and became the dominant topology during the post war recovery of consumer products
* Manufacturers bringing high-quality domestic hi-fi to a steadily widening audience, eventually leading to Dynaco selling over 300,000 ST-70's, making it the world's most popular hi-fi amplifier of any type to date.

===Tube hi-fi in the 1960s===
[[File:Tube push pull poweramplifier.PNG|thumb|400px|Conceptual diagram of a poweramplifier with a split-load phase inverter and push-pull EL34 pentodes endstage]]Valve amplification peaked as the mainstream technology during the 1960s and 70s, with device and circuits being highly developed. There have been only minor refinements since then.

The last generation of power tubes, typified by [[KT66]], [[EL34]] and [[KT88]], represent the pinnacle of the technology and of production quality.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Valve amplifiers produced since that time usually use one of these tubes, which have remained in continuous production (apart from KT66) ever since. Output power was typically 20 watts, exceptionally 35W.

Small signal valves overwhelmingly changed from octal base tubes, notably the audio tube of choice, the [[6SN7]] family, to the smaller and cheaper noval base [[ECC81]], [[ECC82]], [[ECC83]] (UK, in the US known as 12AX7,12AT7, etc.). The lower-power noval base [[EL84]] power pentode was widely used in less expensive 10-watt ultralinear power amplifiers, still of high fidelity.

Commercial tube manufacturers developed designs based on their own products, most notably the [[Mullard 5-10]] circuit. This design and the Williamson were widely implemented and imitated, with or without crediting the originator.

===Automobile amplifiers===
Valve radios and amplifiers were used in [[automobile]]s until they were displaced by [[transistor]]ized radios. Transistors had the major advantage of working off the voltage provided by a car battery. Early radios required a power unit to convert the battery voltage to a value high enough for the valves.  Later radios used special valves that were designed to operate directly from a 12 volt supply.&lt;ref&gt;Mullard ECH83, EBF83 are but two such examples.&lt;/ref&gt;  These later radios were hybrid designs which used transistors only for the audio output stages because a 12 volt power amplifier valve was not practical.  For this and other applications, transistors are smaller, cheaper, more durable, use less power, run cooler, and do not need to warm up.

Some enthusiasts prefer &quot;tube amps&quot;, so a small number of valve car stereos are still made. Manufacturers include Milbert Amplifiers, Blade, Manley, and Sear Sound. Some are hybrid designs with transistors and valves.

===Valve preamplifiers===
Due to the very poor technical performance of early gramophones, the lack of standardised equalisations, poor components and accessories (including loudspeakers), preamplifiers historically contained extensive and very flexible [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[Tone control circuits|tone and filter]] circuits designed to adjust the [[frequency response]] of the amplifier and so the sound produced by the system.

Valve preamplifiers use triodes or low-noise pentodes ([[EF86]]). Mains hum from the heater filaments is a potential problem in low-level valve stages. Modern amplifiers invariably run from the mains; as there is little need to minimise costs in expensive valve amplifiers, the heater supply is often rectified and even regulated to reduce hum to an absolute minimum.

A representative valve preamp from the 1950s is the Leak 'varislope' series of preamps, which included a switchable rumble filter, a switchable scratch filter with selectable slopes and corner frequency, continuously variable treble and bass tone controls and a selection of 4 different gramophone equalisations (RIAA, ortho, RCA, 78).

===Valve sound===
{{main|Valve sound}}

Amplifiers from and prior to this period often have a distinctive sound that today is still widely referred to as &quot;valve sound&quot; and &quot;warm&quot;. This tone is not strictly caused by the use of valves rather than transistors; it is merely a sound that was originally associated with amplifiers built using valves simply because that is what was available at the time. The origins of that particular sound are in part due to:
* the typical circuit designs of the time (class A or AB1), combined with
** simple circuits with relatively little feedback, producing mainly low-harmonic distortion (feedback that could be applied was limited by phase shift in the output transformer);
** low damping factor (High Z out) output stages;
** the use of very large amounts of feedback in signal transformerless semiconductor circuits, which leads to distortion that is small but has a much larger proportion of high harmonics than in valve circuits.

Factors relevant to valve equipment not designed to high-fidelity standards:
* dedicated guitar amplifiers had frequency response and distortion suited to their purpose,
* under-dimensioned and unregulated power supplies in amplifiers where power drawn varied significantly with instantaneous power output (class A not affected, classes AB1, AB2, B, increasingly so),
* poor quality output transformers in budget equipment.

==Notable historic designs==
{{see also |List of valve amplifier designs}}[[File:Harumphy.Quad ii.jpg|thumb|Quad II power amplifier|250px|right]]

In addition to a range of commodity valve amplifiers, some  amplifiers were made which are still highly regarded today. Among the best known are:
* [[LEAK]] TL/12
* [[Williamson amplifier]]
* [[Mullard 5-10]]
* [[Quad Electroacoustics|Quad]] II
* [[Dynaco]] Mark III and Stereo 70
* [[McIntosh Laboratory|McIntosh]] MC275

The '''845''' power [[triode]] is a [[radio frequency|radio]] [[transmitter|transmitting]] [[vacuum tube]] which can also be used as an [[valve audio amplifier|audio amplifier]] and [[modulation]] tube. Typically, the [[plate electrode|plate]] is machined from solid [[graphite]] in order to accommodate high [[Electric current|current]] [[dissipation]] (up to 100 [[watt]]s) and [[voltage]]. Some current production 845 tubes have metal plates.

The 845 tube has a [[bayonet mount]] and [[Thorium dioxide|thoriated]] [[Electrical filament|filament]]s which glow like [[lightbulb]]s when powered up. The glass envelope is about 2-5/16&quot; in diameter and 6&amp;nbsp;inches tall, with the a total tube height of about 7-7/8&amp;nbsp;inches. It was first released by [[RCA]] in 1931. It saw extensive use in RCA [[AM radio]] transmitters

In [[electronics]] the '''300B''' is a directly-heated power [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] with a four-pin base, introduced in 1938 to amplify telephone signals. It measures 6.4&amp;nbsp;inches high and 2.4&amp;nbsp;inches wide, and the [[anode]] can dissipate 40 watts. In the 1980s it started to be used increasingly by [[audiophile]]s in home audio equipment. The 300B has good linearity, low noise and good reliability; it is often used in [[single-ended triode]] (SET) audio amplifiers of about eight [[watt]]s output; a push-pull pair can output 20 watts.

{{As of|2012}} manufacturers of 300B and other tubes of similar characteristics included [[New_Sensor_Corporation|EH Electro Harmonix]], [[Emission Labs - EML]], [[JJ Electronics]], [[KR Audio]], [[Shuguang]], [[Sovtek]], [[Svetlana]], [[TJ FullMusic]] and [[Westrex Corporation]]. Prices for new 300B tubes ranged from US$175 to $900 per matched pair.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6169">'''Eimac''' is a trade mark of Eimac Products, part of the Microwave Power Products Division of [[Communications &amp; Power Industries]]. It produces power [[vacuum tube]]s for [[radio frequency]] applications such as [[broadcasting|broadcast]] and [[radar]] [[transmitter]]s.

==History==
The Bay area was an early center of [[ham radio]] with about 10% of the operators in the United States. William Eitel, Jack McCullough, and [[Charles Litton, Sr.]], who together pioneered vacuum tube manufacturing in the Bay area, were hobbyists with training in technology gained locally who participated in development of [[shortwave radio]] by the ham radio hobby. [[High frequency]], and especially, [[Very high frequency]], VHF, transmission in the 10 meter band, required higher quality power tubes than were manufactured by the consortium of RCA, Western Electric, General Electric, Westinghouse which controlled vacuum tube manufacture. Litton pioneered the [[Lathe#Glass-working lathes|glass lathe]] which made mass production of reliable high quality power tubes possible.&lt;ref name=MSV13-40&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christophe Lécuyer|title=Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930-1970|date=August 24, 2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0262622110|pages=13-40|accessdate=January 28, 2015|format=trade paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While employed by the small [[San Francisco]], [[California]] manufacturing firm of Heintz &amp; Kaufmann which manufactured custom radio equipment Bill Eitel ([[amateur radio]] [[call sign]] W6UF) and Jack McCullough (W6CHE) convinced company president Ralph Heintz (W6XBB) to allow them to develop a transmitting tube that could operate at lower voltages than those then available to the amateur radio market, such as the [[RCA]] 204A or the 852. Their effort was a success and resulted in production of the HK-354. Shortly after in 1934, Eitel and McCullough left H&amp;K to form Eitel McCullough Corp. in [[San Bruno]] California.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, B (1994). ''Radio FUNdamentals, Do You Want A Kilowatt??'' [sic], CQ p.60&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first product produced under the trade mark &quot;Eimac&quot; was the 150T power triode.  The new company thrived during [[World War II]] by selling tubes to the U.S. military for use in [[radar]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, B (1994). ''Radio FUNdamentals, Do You Want A Kilowatt??'' [sic], CQ p.61-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass production===
Contracts to provide transmission tubes for radar and other radio equipment during World War II required adaption of mass production, research to improve the reliability of tubes, and development of standardized manufacturing techniques which could be performed by unskilled workers. The workforce expanded from a few hundred to several thousand.&lt;ref name=MSV38-45&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christophe Lécuyer|title=Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930-1970|date=August 24, 2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0262622110|pages=38-45|accessdate=January 28, 2015|format=trade paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Welfare capitalism===
A union organizing drive in 1939-40 by the strong Bay area labor movement was fought off by adoption of a strategy of [[welfare capitalism]] which included pensions and other generous benefits, profit sharing, and such extras as a medical clinic and a cafeteria. An atmosphere of cooperation and collaboration was established,&lt;ref name=MSV40,41&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christophe Lécuyer|title=Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930-1970|date=August 24, 2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0262622110|pages=40,41|accessdate=January 28, 2015|format=trade paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar===
[[File:Eimac Tube.jpg|thumb|right|EIMAC 4-250A power tetrode]]
As wartime orders ceased and a large supply of military surplus transmission tubes flooded the market the firm laid off 90% of its workers and closed its plant in Salt Lake City. Reallocation of the FM band by the FCC in 1945, however, provided an opportunity for the firm to market a superior power [[tetrode]] tube which it had developed.&lt;ref name=MSV45-48&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christophe Lécuyer|title=Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930-1970|date=August 24, 2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0262622110|pages=45-48|accessdate=January 28, 2015|format=trade paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1947, Eimac operated [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio station [[KSBR]] from their plant in [[San Bruno, California]], one of only two FM stations in the United States to test the new Rangertone [[tape recorder]]s (adapted from the German [[Magnetophon]] recorders).&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=KDdQLuRBVW0C&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=KSBR,+San+Bruno&amp;source=web&amp;ots=oy0c8-ftrX&amp;sig=EgjqmklSrjuR43Jb4pvJ_YXuNmo&amp;hl=en#PPA198,M1&lt;/ref&gt; In need of more space, the company moved to [[San Carlos, California|San Carlos]] in 1959. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/1/10/Eitel_Mccullough.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;  Eimac's San Carlos plant was dedicated on April 16, 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/1/10/Eitel_Mccullough.jpg/?layout=metadata&amp;brand=calisphere Eitel-McCullough, Inc. building in San Carlos, 1959&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965, Eimac merged with [[Varian Associates]] and became known as the Eimac Division.  
In August 1995, [[Varian Associates]] sold the Electron Device Business to [[Leonard Green &amp; Partners]], a private equity fund, and members of management. Together, they formed [[Communications &amp; Power Industries]].

In January 2004, affiliates of [[The Cypress Group]], a private equity fund, acquired CPI.

In February 2011, an affiliate of Veritas Capital, a private equity investment firm acquired CPI.

In 2006 CPI relocated the Eimac facility from 301 Industrial Way to their operation in Palo Alto.

[[File:6l1p 1970 vostok.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Nonode 6Л1П (6L1P), Manufactured in Novosibirsk, 1970]]

A '''nonode''' is a type of [[Vacuum tube|thermionic valve]] that has nine active [[electrode]]s. The term most commonly applies to a seven-grid [[vacuum tube]], also sometimes called an '''enneode'''. An example was the [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/046/e/EQ80.pdf EQ80]/UQ80, which was used as an [[Frequency modulation|FM]] [[Detector (radio)#Quadrature detector|quadrature detector]]. It was developed during the introduction of TV and FM radio and delivered an output voltage large enough to directly drive an end [[pentode]] while still allowing for some [[negative feedback]]. As most of the grids were tied together, even an 8-pin Rimlock base was sufficient in the case of the EQ40.

The '''6550''' is a high power [[beam tetrode]] [[vacuum tube]] used mainly as an [[sound|audio]] power [[amplifier]].

==History and uses==
The 6550 was developed by [[Tung-Sol]] in 1955 &lt;ref&gt;http://vintagetubeservices.com/page16.html ''Tung Sol'', Vintage Tube Service&lt;/ref&gt; originally for use as a [[servomechanism|servo amplifier]]. It was used in audio equipment before [[semiconductor]] power amplifiers came into use, and continues in production today. It is often found in valve-driven [[Bass instrument amplification|bass amplifiers]] such as [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] and [[Ampeg]] [[guitar amplifiers]] and the [[Leslie speaker]] system. 

Based on the [[6L6]] vacuum tube, the 6550 was designed to have higher output power and better stability.  It operates with a plate voltage of 600VDC, a screen voltage of 400VDC, and plate dissipation of 35 watts.&lt;ref name=&quot;6550valve&quot;&gt;[http://www.jacmusic.com/KT88/kt88.htm Jac Music History of KT88, KT66, and 6550]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[KT88]], [[KT90]], and 6550, although not identical, are often interchangeable, dependent on external circuit parameters. The 6550's glass envelope was originally wider in the middle than at the top and bottom, but a straight-sided design was later introduced by [[GE]] and [[Philips]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boi Audio Works&quot;&gt;[http://www.boiaudioworks.com/index.php?cPath=69 Boi Audio Works]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3076">A '''field emitter array''' (FEA) is a particular form of [[field electron emission|large-area field electron source]]. FEAs are prepared on a silicon substrate by lithographic techniques similar to those used in the fabrication of integrated circuits.  Their structure consists of a very large number of individual, similar, small field electron emitters, usually organized in a regular two-dimensional pattern. FEAs need to be distinguished from  &quot;film&quot; or &quot;mat&quot; type large-area sources, where a thin film-like layer of material is deposited onto a substrate, using a uniform deposition process, in the hope or expectation that (as a result of statistical irregularities in the process) this film will contain a sufficiently large number of individual emission sites.

== Spindt arrays ==

The original form of FEA was the ''Spindt array'', in which the individual field emitters are small sharp molybdenum cones. Each is deposited inside a cylindrical void in an oxide film, with a counterelectrode deposited on the top of the film. The counterelectrode (called the &quot;gate&quot;) contains a separate circular aperture for each conical emitter. The individual cones are sometimes called ''Spindt tips''. The device is named after [[Charles A. Spindt]], who developed this technology at [[SRI International]].

Because it has a relatively sharp apex, a Spindt tip can create a high electric field at a relatively low voltage, and thus emits significant amounts of current at relatively low gate voltages (less than 100 V). Because of the use of lithographic techniques, the individual emitters can be packed close together. The average (or &quot;macroscopic&quot;) current density that can be obtained from a Spindt array can be as much as 2×10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}.   

One of the earliest article describing a single emitter tip microfabricated on a wafer dates back to 1968.&lt;ref name=SpindtArticle&gt;C. A. Spindt, &quot;A thin-film field-emission cathode&quot;, Journal of Applied Physics, vol. 39, no. 7, pages 3504-3505, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;
Spindt, Shoulders and Heynick filed a U.S. Patent &lt;ref name=SpindtPatent&gt;U.S. Patent 3,755,704 granted on August 28, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970 for a vacuum device comprising an array of emitter tips.

== CNT FEA ==

An alternative form of FEA is fabricated by creating voids in an oxide film (as for a Spindt array) and then using standard methods to grow one or more carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in each void.

It is also possible to grow &quot;free-standing&quot; CNT arrays.

== Applications ==

The main use of a FEA is in connection with a form of electronic information display (a &quot;flat panel display&quot;) known as a [[field emission display]] (or, more recently as a &quot;nano-emissive display&quot;.)

However, possible uses as microwave generators and as space-vehicle neutralisers have also been explored.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1557">The '''Additron''' was an electron tube designed by Dr. [[Josef Kates]], circa 1950, to replace the several individual electron tubes and support components required to perform the function of a single bit digital [[full adder]].  Dr. Kates developed the Additron with the intention of increasing the likelihood of success and reliability while reducing the size, power consumption and complexity of the University of Toronto Electronic Computer, ([[UTEC]])&lt;ref&gt;Vardalas JN (2001).''The Computer Revolution in Canada'' MIT Press, ISBN 0-262-22064-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Additron neither went into production at the Canadian [[Rogers Vacuum Tube Company]], where the prototypes were built, nor was it used in the UTEC machine.  It did make a widely publicized appearance at the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]] operating an electronic game of [[Tic-Tac-Toe]], dubbed ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'', to show the marvels of electronic computing.

The tube was registered with the [[Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association|Radio Television Manufacturing Association ]] &lt;ref&gt;RTMA Engineering Department, Release #951, 20 March 1951&lt;/ref&gt; on 20 March 1951 as type 6047.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley L (2007).

The '''Computron''' was an electron tube designed to perform the parallel addition and multiplication of digital numbers.  It was conceived by Richard L. Snyder, Jr., [[Jan A. Rajchman]], Paul Rudnick and the digital computer group at the laboratories of the [[Radio Corporation of America]] under the direction of [[Vladimir Zworykin]].  Development began in 1941 under contract OEM-sr-591 to Division 7 of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] of the United States Office of Research and Development.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Mindell ''Between human and machine: feedback, control, and computing before cybernetics'',JHU Press, 2002 ISBN 0-8018-6895-5, page 292&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerical function of the Computron was to solve the equation   &lt;math&gt;S=(A*B)+C+D&lt;/math&gt;   where A, B, C, and D are 14 bit inputs and S is a 28 bit output. This function was key to the RCA attempt to produce a non-[[analog computer]] based [[fire-control system]] for use in artillery aiming during WWII.

A simple way to describe the physically complex Computron is to begin with a [[cathode ray tube]] structure in the form of a right-circular cylinder with a central vertical cathode structure.  The cylinder is composed of 14 discrete planes, each plane having 14 individual radial outward projecting beams.  Each of the 196 individual beams is steered by multiple deflection plates toward its two targets.  Some deflection plates are connected to circuitry external to the Computron and are the data inputs.  The balance of the plates are connected to internal targets and are the partial sums and products from other stages within the tube.  Some of the targets are connected to circuitry outside the tube and represent the result.

The electronic function of the Computron design incorporated steered, rather than gated, multiple electron beams.    Additionally, the Computron was based on the ability of a [[secondary electron emission]] target, under electron bombardment, to assume the potential of the nearest collector electrode.  The [[Additron Tube]] design by [[Josef Kates]] gated electron beams of a fixed trajectory with several control grids which either passed or blocked a current.  The Computron was a complex cathode ray tube while the Additron was a [[triode]] with multiple grids and targets.

A subsection of the Computron was prototyped and tested and the concept validated but the building of an entire device was never attempted.

A United States Patent was filed 30 July 1943 and granted 22 July 1947 for the Computron.

== Modern implications ==

The Computron design was an early attempt to produce not only a vacuum tube [[integrated circuit]] for both size and reliability (lifetime) issues, but to minimize external electrical connections between active elements.  The goal of integration is not merely to reduce external signal connections into and out of a package by including multiple active devices in one package, as in the [[Loewe 3NF]] tube. It is to merge the functions of the active devices for a technical synergy.  A modern example would be the multiple-emitter transistor of [[Transistor–transistor logic]] integrated circuits

Another modern construct anticipated by the Computron is the [[barrel shifter]] circuit which is used in many numeric computation  style microprocessors.

== Damning praise ==

The Computron was an idea born of the necessity of war research.  It was to be a key element of the electronic digital computer which had yet to be built.  But the project was begun to increase the accuracy of artillery in battle, not to advance the state of the embryonic electronic computer.

Its fate was well described in a letter to Dr. [[Paul E. Klopsteg]], Head of NDRC Division 17, dated 6 February 1943 which concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

...As I said above, our entire Division is exceedingly reluctant to see a development which is scientifically so beautiful and so promising dropped at this point, though cold reason tells us that we cannot justify the expenditure of additional Government funds on the basis of Fire Control at this time.&lt;br /&gt; 
 &lt;br /&gt; 
Sincerely yours, &lt;br /&gt;
[[Harold Locke Hazen|Harold L. Hazen]] &lt;br /&gt;
Chief, Division 7 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[electronics]] '''cathode bias''', also called '''self-bias''', is a circuit used with amplifying [[vacuum tube]]s (valves) such as [[triode]]s, [[tetrode]]s and [[pentode]]s to provide a steady negative DC [[biasing|bias]] voltage on the [[control grid]] electrode of the tube, to set the operating point.  It consists of a [[resistor]] connected between the tube's [[cathode]] and [[ground (electricity)|ground]], in parallel with a bypass [[capacitor]].  Used with [[Hot cathode|indirectly-heated]] tubes, it is one of the most widely used [[biasing]] circuits in vacuum tube electronic equipment.

==Early techniques==
Early experimenters and manufacturers used a battery to provide this bias. This battery, called the &quot;C&quot; or bias battery provided [[voltage]] but almost never was called upon to deliver current. Thus, such batteries lasted nearly as long in service as they would have on a shelf. In 1985, The Department of Engineering and Technology at [[Cuesta College]] in [[San Luis Obispo, California]] was presented with a &quot;C&quot; battery date stamped 1927. Department Chairman W.E. English and Instructor W.T. Hanley conducted experiments which demonstrated that the battery still performed satisfactorily in its originally intended role more than 50 years after its manufacture.

Battery bias, however, is not self-adjusting, and does not accommodate differences between a new tube and one that has aged, differences between various tubes of the same type, or substitutions that may be made in tube type by repair technicians. Cathode bias automatically accounts for all these possibilities. It is inherent in the technique that the bias level is set by the operation of each individual tube.

==Establishing cathode bias==
To establish cathode bias, a [[resistor]] is placed between the emitting element, or cathode and the negative return of the &quot;B&quot; or HT supply. Current drawn through this resistor by tube conduction places the cathode slightly more positive than the negative return. The grid input is returned directly to the negative supply, causing it to be negative with respect to the cathode. Thus, changes in tube conduction are automatically compensated by changes in bias.

This scheme inherently introduces dynamic, even harmonic distortion. As the input signal becomes more positive, cathode current increases, increasing bias and reducing gain. As the input signal becomes more negative, cathode current decreases, decreasing bias and increasing gain.{{Fact|date=July 2014}} The result is a plate signal with positive excursions greater than the negative input and negative excursions smaller than the positive input. It must be borne in mind that the input and output signals are ideally exactly out of phase. Since cathode bias is normally employed at audio or very low radio frequencies, issues such as transit time and interelectrode capacitance may be disregarded and the ideal assumed.

==Overcoming problems==
To overcome this problem, the bias resistor is typically shunted by a capacitor. In general, the capacitor value is selected such that the time constant of the capacitor and bias resistor is an order of magnitude greater than the period of the lowest frequency to be amplified. The capacitor thus acts as a dynamic battery, and makes the bias constant through input signal swings.

In some designs, the degenerative feedback inherent in cathode bias may be desirable. In this case, two carefully designed successive stages may be employed, such that the distortion introduced by the first stage is exactly cancelled by that introduced in the second. This technique is not recommended, as the design considerations become very complex. Other degenerative feedback techniques are easier to design, and should be used.

An exception to the general rule may be made in the case of &quot;push-pull&quot;, or balanced circuits. A pair of tubes, driven by identical signals 180 degrees out of phase, may share a common unbypassed cathode resistor. Slight differences in tube conduction are then dynamically balanced by bias variations that tend to reduce distortion. This technique is useful in the input circuits of balanced line receivers or push-pull power output circuits.

==Uses==
Cathode bias is also used to achieve [[phase inversion]]. In a more simple circuit, which has less than unity gain, the cathode and plate resistors are made equal. In accordance with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's law]], the current through both resistors will be equal, thus the voltage across them will also be equal. As the plate becomes more negative, the cathode will become more positive, and conversely. The resulting signals are capacitively coupled to any succeeding stages, providing a pair of signals 180° out of phase.

The other technique is to use a pair of amplifier tubes with a common cathode resistor. In this case, the input tube is operated as a standard common cathode amplifier, while its twin is operated in common grid mode. The input signal is amplified by the input tube in the normal fashion. An unbypassed cathode resistor, common to both tubes, couples the signal to the cathode of the second amplifier, which is operated in &quot;Grounded grid&quot; mode, with the grid resistor bypassed by a capacitor which maintains a constant grid voltage. The pair of tubes produce outputs exactly out of phase, but the gain of the grounded grid amplifier is slightly higher, requiring that their plate resistances be different in order to maintain balance.

Mathematically, the gain of the phase inverting stage is given by the product of the amplification factor and the load impedance divided by the sum of the plate resistance and the load impedance. The gain of the in phase stage is given by the product of (one plus the amplification factor) and the load impedance divided by the sum of the plate resistance and the load impedance. In order for the gains to be equal, it is customary to use different values of plate resistance. For example, in such a phase inverting circuit using a 12AX7, the inverting stage would have a plate resistor of 100K[[ohm|Ω]] while the in phase stage would use a resistor of 82 KΩ. Mathematically, it works out pretty close.

Another problem is a slight reduction in gain. The cathode, or bias resistor appears in series with the plate, or load resistor. The bias voltage must be subtracted from the total &quot;B&quot; or HT voltage in gain calculations. In most circuits, this problem is easily overcome by selecting a load impedance at least two orders of magnitude greater than the bias resistance. For example, a 1K bias resistor will have virtually no effect if the load impedance is at least 100K. These values were, in fact, used by Leo Fender in many of his guitar amplifier designs. Refer to &quot;The Tube Amp Book&quot; by Gerald Weber, schematic section.

[[Image:RCA Indian Head test pattern.JPG|thumb|right|The widely used [[Indian Head test pattern]] was generated by a monoscope.]]
[[Image:Monoscope.jpg|thumb|right|A monoscope]]
[[Image:Cintel monoscope.jpg|thumb|right|Early Cinema Television (UK) monoscope advertisement]]

A '''monoscope''' was a special form of [[video camera tube]] which displayed a single still video image.  The image was built into the tube, hence the name.  The tube resembled a small [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT).  Monoscopes were used beginning in the 1950s to generate TV [[test pattern]]s and station logos.  This type of test card generation system was technologically obsolete by the 1980s.

== Design ==
The monoscope was similar in construction to a [[cathode ray tube|CRT]], with an electron gun at one end, but in place of a [[phosphor]]-coated screen which displayed an image, it had a metal target with an image formed on it.  As the [[electron beam]] scanned the target, varying amounts of electrons were reflected from the different areas of the image.  The reflected electrons were picked up by an internal electrode ring, producing a varying electrical signal which was amplified to become the [[video signal|video]] output of the tube.

This signal reproduced an accurate still image of the target, so the monoscope was used to produce still images such as [[test pattern]]s and station logo cards.   For example, the classic [[Indian Head test card]] used by NBC, shown on the right was often produced using a monoscope.

== Usage ==
Monoscopes were available with a wide variety of standard patterns and messages, and could be ordered with a custom image such as a station logo.  Monoscope &quot;cameras&quot; were widely used to produce test cards, station logos, special signals for test purposes and standard announcements like &quot;''Please stand by''&quot; and  &quot;''normal service will be resumed''....&quot;. They had many advantages over using a live camera pointed at a card; an expensive camera was not tied up, they were always ready, and were never misframed or out of focus. Indeed, monoscopes were often used to calibrate the live cameras, by comparing the monoscope image and the live camera image of the same test pattern.

Pointing an electronic camera at the same stationary monochrome caption for a long period of time could result in the image becoming burnt onto the camera tube's target&amp;nbsp;— and even onto the [[phosphor]] of a monitor displaying it in extreme cases.
[[Image:MonoscopeCU.jpg|thumb|right|The target is [[List of BBC test cards#Test Card G|Test Card G]] in this example]]
The monoscope declined in popularity during the 1960s due to its inability to generate a colour [[Test card#UK Test Card timeline|test card]], and the development of [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] TV test pattern signal generators.

The '''inductive output tube''' ('''IOT''') or '''klystrode''' is a variety of high frequency transmitting linear-beam [[vacuum tube]], similar to a [[klystron]], which evolved in the 1980s to meet increasing efficiency requirements for high-power [[radio frequency|RF]] [[amplifier]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot;&gt;{{cite book

IOTs are also used in [[particle accelerator]]s.  They are capable of producing power output up to about 30 kW continuous and 7 MW pulsed and gains of 20–23 dB at frequencies up to about a [[gigahertz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sisodia&quot; /&gt;

==History==
The inductive output tube (IOT) was invented in 1938 by [[Andrew V. Haeff]]. A [[patent]] was later issued for the IOT to Andrew V. Haeff and assigned to the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA). During the 1939 [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] the IOT was used in the transmission of the first television images from the [[Empire State Building]] to the fair grounds. RCA sold a small IOT commercially for a short time, under the type number 825. It was soon made obsolete by newer developments, and the technology lay more or less dormant for years.

The inductive output tube has re-emerged within the last twenty years after having been discovered to possess particularly suitable characteristics (broadband linearity) for the transmission of [[digital television]] and [[high-definition television|high-definition digital television]].

The power output of the modern 21st century IOTs is orders of magnitude higher than the first IOTs produced by the RCA in 1940–1941 but the fundamental principle of operation basically remains the same. IOTs since the 1970s have been designed with electromagnetic modeling computer software that has greatly improved their electrodynamic performance.

==Description==

IOTs have been described as a cross between a klystron and a [[triode]], hence [[Eimac]]'s trade name for them, '''Klystrode'''.  They have an [[electron gun]] like a klystron, but with a [[control grid]] in front of it like a triode, with a very close spacing of around 0.1 mm. The high frequency RF voltage on the grid allows the electrons through in bunches.    High voltage [[direct current|DC]] on a cylindrical anode accelerates the modulated electron beam through a small drift tube like a klystron. This drift tube prevents backflow of electromagnetic radiation. The bunched electron beam passes through the hollow anode into a resonant cavity, similar to the output cavity of a klystron, and strikes a collector electrode.  As in a klystron, each bunch passes into the cavity at a time when the electric field decelerates it, transforming the kinetic energy of the beam into potential energy of the RF field, amplifying the signal.  The oscillating electromagnetic energy in the cavity is extracted by a coaxial transmission line.  An axial [[magnetic field]] prevents space charge spreading of the beam.  The collector electrode is at a lower potential than the anode (depressed collector) which recovers some of the energy from the beam, increasing efficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sisodia&quot; /&gt;

Two differences from the klystron give it a lower cost and higher efficiency.  First, the klystron uses ''velocity modulation'' to create bunching; its beam current is constant.  It requires a drift tube several feet in length to allow the electrons to bunch.  In contrast the IOT uses ''current modulation'' like an ordinary triode; most of the bunching is done by the grid, so the tube can be much shorter, making it less expensive to build and mount, and less bulky.  Secondly, since the klystron has beam current throughout the RF cycle, it can only operate as an inefficient [[class-A amplifier]], while the grid of the IOT allows more versatile operating modes.  The grid can be biased so the beam current can be cut off during part of the cycle, enabling it to operate in the more efficient [[class-B amplifier|class B]] or AB mode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sisodia&quot; /&gt; 

The highest frequency achievable in an IOT is limited by the grid-to-cathode spacing. The electrons must be accelerated off the cathode and pass the grid before the RF electric field reverses direction. The upper limit on frequency is approximately {{nowrap|1300 [[megahertz|MHz]]}}.  The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of the IOT is 20–23 dB versus 35–40 dB for a klystron.  The lower gain is usually not a problem because at 20 dB the requirements for drive power (1% of output power) are within the capabilities of economical solid state UHF amplifiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot; /&gt;

===Recent advances===
The latest versions of IOTs achieve even higher efficiencies (60%-70%) through the use of a Multistage Depressed Collector (MSDC).  One manufacturer's version is called the Constant Efficiency Amplifier (CEA), while another manufacturer markets their version as the ESCIOT (Energy Saving Collector IOT). The initial design difficulties of MSDCIOTs were overcome through the use of recirculating high dielectric transformer oil as a combined coolant and insulation medium to prevent arcing and erosion between the closely spaced collector stages and to provide reliable low-maintenance collector cooling for the life of the tube. Earlier MSDC versions had to be air cooled (limited power) or used de-inonized water that had to be filtered, regularly exchanged and provided no freezing or corrosion protection.

==Disadvantages==
Thermal radiation from the cathode heats the grid. As a result, [[work function|low-work-function]] cathode material evaporates and condenses on the grid. This eventually leads to a short between cathode and grid, as the material accreting on the grid narrows the gap between it and the cathode. In addition, the emissive cathode material on the grid causes a negative grid current (reverse electron flow from the grid to the cathode). This can swamp the grid power supply if this reverse current gets too high, changing the grid (bias) voltage and, consequently, the operating point of the tube. Today's IOTs are equipped with coated cathodes that work at relatively low operating temperatures, and hence have slower evaporation rates, minimizing this effect. 

Like most linear beam tubes having external tuning cavities, IOTs are vulnerable to [[electric arc|arcing]], and must be protected with arc detectors located in the output cavities that trigger a [[crowbar (circuit)|crowbar]] circuit based on a hydrogen [[thyratron]] or a triggered spark gap in the high-voltage supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot; /&gt;  The purpose of the crowbar circuit is to instantly dump the massive electrical charge stored in the high voltage beam supply before this energy can damage the tube assembly during an uncontrolled cavity, collector or cathode arc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot; /&gt;

'''Compactrons''' are a type of [[vacuum tube|thermionic valve]], or  vacuum tube, which contain arrangements of [[diode]]s, [[triode]]s, or [[pentode]]s in multiple combination arrays, as well as high or low-[[voltage]] and power types.

== History ==
The '''Compactron''' is a 12-pin [[vacuum tube]] family introduced in 1961 by [[General Electric]] in [[Owensboro, Kentucky]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&amp;ArticleID=4554 |title=Multi-Function Compactrons Promise Two-Tube Radio |publisher=Electronic Design |page=74 |date=July 20, 1960 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; to compete with transistorized electronics during the [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] transition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.junkbox.com/electronics/CompactronTubesIndex.shtml  |title=Compactron Tubes: A Junkbox Guide |publisher=Copperwood Media LLC. |first=Jeff |last=Duntemann |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Television]] sets were a primary application.

Use was prevalent in televisions because transistors were slow to achieve the high power and frequency capabilities needed particularly in color television sets. The first portable color television, the General Electric [[Porta-Color]], was designed using 13 tubes, 10 of which were Compactrons.

Compactron's integrated valve design helped lower power consumption and heat generation (they were to tubes what [[integrated circuits]] were to [[transistors]]). Compactrons were also used in a few high end Hi-Fi stereos.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; They were also used by the Ampeg guitar amplifier company in some of their guitar amps. No modern tube based Hi-Fi systems are known to use this tube type, as simpler and more readily available tubes have again filled this niche.

== Notable features ==
[[Image:Duodekar.JPG|thumb|right|The evacuation tip is in the center of the circular pin pattern.]]
A distinguishing feature of most Compactrons is the placement of the [[evacuation tip]] on the bottom end, rather than the top end as was customary with &quot;miniature&quot; tubes, and a characteristic 3/4&quot; diameter circle pin pattern.
* Most Compactrons ranged in glass envelope diameter from 1{{fraction|1|8}}&quot; to 2{{fraction|3|4}}&quot; depending upon the internal configuration. Variations of the Compactron design were made by [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]] and by some Japanese firms.

== Examples ==
Examples of Compactrons type types include:
*6AG11 high-mu twin triode
*6BK11 triple triode
*6C10 high-mu triple triode by [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]], etc.... ''not related to the [[Ediswan|Edison Swan (later Mazda)]] 6C10 triode-hexode''
*6M11 twin triode - pentode
*6K11 triple triode
*6LF6 beam power tetrode with anode cap
*8B10 twin triode - twin diode
*12AE10 twin pentode
*38HK7 pentode diode

Due to their specific applications in television circuits, many different Compactron types were produced. Almost all were assigned using standard US tube numbers.

== Technological obsolescence ==
Integrated circuits (of the analogue and digital type) gradually took over all of the functions that the Compactron was designed for. &quot;Hybrid&quot; television sets produced in the early to mid-1970s made use of a combination of tubes (typically Compactrons), transistors, and integrated circuits in the same set. By the mid-1980s this type of tube was functionally obsolete. Compactrons simply don't exist in any TV sets designed after 1986. Other specialist uses of the tube declined in parallel with the television set manufacture. Manufacture of Compactrons ceased in the early 1990s. New old stock replacements for almost all Compactron types produced are easily found for sale on the Internet.

Of note, in the 1960s, the 6BK11 Triple Triode Compactron tube was used by the Ampeg amplifier company in some of their guitar amps.  Ampeg is the only guitar amp manufacturer that used this tube in their amps.  The 6BK11 is in increasingly short supply today as an NOS replacement for stock tubes.  NOS tubes are very important in guitar amps because they keep the amp performing as it was designed, which means it will produce the desired tone.  There is a whole &quot;cottage industry&quot; that exists in producing vacuum tubes that are replacements for stock guitar amp tubes.  The cottage industry exists because class A, open-ended, hand-wired, tube-driven guitar amps have a warm sound that is preferred by many musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/the-cool-sound-of-tubes The Cool Sound of Tubes - IEEE Spectrum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The warmer sound of older amps means they command a premium resale value on the open market, and so in turn, any parts in the amp that may wear out over time or with use, (including the vacuum tubes), also command similar values.  The 6BK11 is a good example of this.

The '''EF86''' is a high [[transconductance]] sharp cutoff [[pentode]] [[vacuum tube]] with [[Tube socket#Noval|Noval (B9A) base]] for [[audio-frequency]] applications.

It was introduced in the late 1950s and was produced by [[Philips]], [[Mullard]], [[Telefunken]], Valvo, and GEC among others. It is very similar electrically to the [[Tube socket|octal base]] EF37A and the [[Tube socket#Rimlock|Rimlock base]] EF40. Unlike many pentodes it was designed specifically for audio applications, low noise and low [[microphony]] being claimed advantages, although a rubber-mounted vibration-resistant base was still recommended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aai0113.htm National valve museum: EF86]&lt;/ref&gt; It has much higher stage gain than any triode, which makes it susceptible to microphony. The EF86 was used in many [[preamplifier]] designs during the last decades of vacuum tube [[hi-fi]] development. An industrial variant of the tube is known as '''6267'''. In the former [[Soviet Union]] a variant was also produced as type '''6Zh32P''' (Russian: '''6Ж32П'''.)  {{As of|2012}} EF86s were being produced in [[Russia]] in two versions under the [[Electro-Harmonix]] brand and in the [[Slovak Republic]] as JJ Electronics (formerly [[Tesla (Czechoslovak company)|Tesla]]).

== Characteristics ==
6.3 [[Volt]], 200 mA indirectly-heated A.F. miniature pentode with Noval (B9A) base with an EIA 9CQ (or 9BJ&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj7p.org/Tube4.php?tube=EF86&lt;/ref&gt;) basing diagram.
* Transconductance: 2.2 mA/V at I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=3.0&amp;nbsp;mA, I&lt;sub&gt;g2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.6&amp;nbsp;mA, V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=250&amp;nbsp;V, V&lt;sub&gt;g1&lt;/sub&gt;=-2.2&amp;nbsp;V, V&lt;sub&gt;g2&lt;/sub&gt;=140&amp;nbsp;V, V&lt;sub&gt;g3&lt;/sub&gt;=0&amp;nbsp;V
* Voltage gain: 185 (45[[Decibel|dB]]) at V&lt;sub&gt;supply&lt;/sub&gt;=250&amp;nbsp;V, I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;=0.9&amp;nbsp;mA, R&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;=2.2&amp;nbsp;kilohm, R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=220&amp;nbsp;kilohm, R&lt;sub&gt;g1&lt;/sub&gt;=1&amp;nbsp;megohm, Vout&lt;44&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;

Special precautions have been taken in the design to reduce:
* [[Mains hum|Hum]] (through a [[bifilar]]-wound twisted pair of heater wires),
* [[Noise (electronic)|noise]], and
* microphony (through a rigid internal structure to reduce resonances).

The EF86 is much less noisy than other pentodes, but slightly noisier than some [[triode]]s at about 2 µV equivalent input noise to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz. Although used in circuits such as tape recorder input stages and instrument amplifiers, microphony can be a problem, even when mounted in a vibration-reducing valve holder.

== Equivalent and similar devices ==
* 6267 * Z729 * CV2901 * 6BK8 * 6CF8 * 6F22 * CV8068 * CV10098

Special quality:
* EF86SQ * M8195 * CV4085 * EF806S

Different heater requirements:
* PF86, 300&amp;nbsp;mA (4.5&amp;nbsp;V)
* UF86, 100&amp;nbsp;mA (12.6&amp;nbsp;V)

The rarely used EF83 is a remote-cutoff pentode&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aaa0527.htm Natrional Valve Museum: EF83]&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise similar to the EF86; the remote cutoff (variable mu) makes it suitable for applications such as [[automatic gain control]] (agc) in tape recorders.

== History of Use ==

In the [[Soviet Union]] '''6N14P''' found application in special equipment and to a lesser extent in more-expensive [[FM broadcasting|FM]] receivers and [[television]] sets in the 1960s.  However, in the majority of medium and low-grade Soviet-produced FM radios a more general purpose [[6N3P]] (2C51) vacuum tube was utilized, as the lower frequency [[OIRT]] [[FM broadcast band|FM band]] used in the USSR (65.8 to 74 MHz) allowed for less stringent [[noise figure]] requirements towards the receiver design and its components than the higher frequency Western FM broadcast band (87.5-108 MHz) used in most of the rest of the world.

Currently, like many other vacuum tubes, '''6N14P''' has found some use with [[DIY]] audio enthusiasts.

The '''6AK5''' [[vacuum tube]] is a miniature 7-pin sharp-cutoff [[pentode]] used as [[Radio frequency|RF]] or [[Intermediate frequency|IF]] [[amplifier]] especially in high-frequency wide-band applications at frequencies up to 400 [[MHz]].

It was developed by Bell Labs / Western Electric and used extensively as an I.F. amplifier in WWII radar systems.  The tube is notable for its extremely fine grid, and extremely close control grid to cathode spacing, yielding excellent high-frequency performance.

It is also known as '''EF95''' under its [[Mullard-Philips tube designation|Mullard-Phillips]] designation and was produced in the former [[Soviet Union]] as type '''6Zh1P''' (Russian: '''6Ж1П''') under the [[Russian tube designations|Russian designation]] system.

A version of this tube with extended ratings was designated '''6AK5W''' and '''6Zh1P-EV''' (Russian: '''6Ж1П-ЕВ''') respectively.

Even though primarily intended for VHF amplification(1), the tube has found some use in [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] applications as a [[microphone]] preamplifier, for instance in [[LOMO]] 19A9 microphone and in [[guitar]] effects [[Effects pedal|stompboxes]], such as [[Metasonix]] TM-7 Scrotum Smasher.{{Citation Needed|date=December 2014}}

The 6AK5 was used in some types of [[radiosonde]], (weather balloon  payloads), in the 1960s and 70s. Because of the non-recoverable nature of the equipment, the single 6AK5 was soldered directly to the printed circuit board and served as the only active device in the circuit, performing the function of a low frequency modulation oscillator and the high frequency carrier oscillator and output stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1736">'''Wunderlich''' refers to a series of [[vacuum tube]]s introduced in the early 1930s.  Wunderlichs were designed to be used as full-wave [[detector (radio)|detectors]] in [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[radio]] receivers.  However, because of their unusual design, they were rarely used in commercially manufactured receivers.  The tube is named for its inventor, Norman Wunderlich.

==Structure==
The Wunderlich tube is a twin medium-mu [[triode]].  The tube has two identical control grids that operate in tandem with a common heater, indirectly heated [[cathode]] and plate.  

==Function==
Typically, the two grids are connected to opposite ends of the center-tapped secondary of the final [[intermediate frequency|IF]] transformer.  The center tap of the secondary is then connected to ground through a parallel-connected resistor and capacitor circuit.  This causes the tube to act as a full-wave [[grid leak]] detector.  In some circuits, the center tap also provides [[automatic gain control|AVC]] bias voltage to the converter and/or IF amplifier.  Some Wunderlichs, like the Wunderlich B, have a diode plate or a second grid that provide AVC bias voltage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9569">A '''plate detector''' (or '''anode-bend detector''') is a [[vacuum tube]] [[detector (radio)|detector]] circuit used in [[amplitude modulation|A.M.]] radios, although the term is sometimes extended to transistor circuits that similarly rely upon distorted amplification to enhance one half of the received signal over the other.  This circuit employs a tube with an [[hot cathode|indirectly heated cathode]], typically a medium-mu [[triode]], or a [[tetrode]] or [[pentode]] with a sharp [[cut-off (electronics)|cut-off]] [[control grid]].  Partial rectification of [[radio frequency|R.F.]] signals occurs in the plate of the detector tube if it is forced into its non-linear region at roughly the [[zero crossing]] point of the input signal.  This differs from a [[grid-leak detector]], which achieves rectification in the control grid.  It also differs from the diode detector circuit commonly used to provide both R.F. rectification and [[automatic gain control|automatic volume control (A.V.C.)]] bias to the [[Valve RF amplifier|R.F. amplifier]] tubes.

== Overview ==

Enough negative bias is applied to the grid (or ''base'', for a transistor implementation) to bring the device almost to cut-off point; an incoming signal will cause the device to conduct only on positive-going halves of the input signal... it cannot conduct significantly ''less'' during negative halves, so the plate voltage varies at the modulation frequency - going more negative as the input signal envelope increases with the [[Amplitude Modulation]] modulating signal.

Plate detectors are used in both [[Tuned radio frequency receiver|T.R.F.]] and (less commonly) [[superheterodyne]] receivers.  The grid is connected directly to the secondary of the final R.F. or [[intermediate frequency|I.F.]] transformer.  The cathode is connected to ground through a circuit consisting of a parallel-connected bias [[resistor]] (usually 10 kΩ to 50 kΩ) and bypass [[capacitor]] (usually 0.25 µF to 0.5 µF).  When sufficient negative bias is applied to the grid, the plate current is pushed almost to the cut-off point.  When a [[modulation|modulated]] R.F. signal is applied to the grid under these conditions, a corresponding increase in plate current occurs.  As the signal amplitude varies, the plate current also varies, causing the plate to act as a diode detector while the tube as a whole also acts as an audio amplifier.  A plate bypass capacitor (usually 500 [[picofarad|pF]] to 0.002 µF for triodes, or 250 pF to 0.001 µF for tetrodes and pentodes) is used to regulate plate current.

Like most A.F. amplifiers in radios, the plate voltage is usually less than 60 volts.  When a tetrode or pentode is used, the screen grid voltage is usually about one-half the plate voltage.

Plate detector circuits were commonly used from the introduction of indirectly heated cathode tubes in the late 1920s until the start of World War II.  As R.F. tubes became more sensitive, grid-leak detectors (which are more sensitive than plate detectors) became less practical.  Diode detectors were popular because, unlike plate detector circuits, they could also provide A.V.C. bias.  However, the [[double diode triode|dual-diode/triode]] and dual-diode/pentode tubes commonly used in these circuits had bulk [[wholesale]] costs that were as much as twice the cost of the tubes commonly used as plate detectors.  This made plate detector circuits more practical for low-priced radios sold during the depths of the [[Great Depression]].

Because an indirectly heated cathode is required (or a separate negative grid bias battery is needed) for this circuit to operate, it is not used in battery-operated radios.

===Controlling volume levels===

Plate detector circuits usually lack an A.V.C. bias circuit.  In receivers equipped with A.V.C., volume levels are adjusted by a [[potentiometer]] (typically 500 kΩ to 2 MΩ audio taper) that controls audio signal levels at the control grid of the A.F. amplifier.  In receivers not equipped with A.V.C., the most common connection of the volume control potentiometer (typically 4 kΩ to 15 kΩ linear taper) is as follows:

*The low side of the potentiometer is connected to the antenna connection at the antenna input coil;
*The center wiper is connected to ground (in A.C. receivers) or B- (in A.C./D.C. receivers);
*The high side is connected to the cathode of at least one R.F. amplifier (in T.R.F. receivers) or to the converter and/or the I.F. amplifier (in superheterodyne receivers).

To assure that proper cathode bias is maintained, many non-A.V.C. volume controls are usually equipped with a &quot;stop&quot; that maintains a small amount of resistance between the center wiper and the high end connection.

*Other volume control circuits in non-A.V.C. receivers include:
**A potentiometer (typically 500 kΩ audio taper) where the high end and center wiper are connected as above, but where the low end is connected to the control grid of audio output tube.  (In this circuit, the potentiometer replaces the bias resistor for the output tube's control grid);
**A linear taper potentiometer that adjusts the screen grid voltages of the set's R.F. amplifiers (if they are tetrodes or pentodes);
**A linear taper potentiometer connected to the antenna (high end), ground (low end) and the antenna input coil (center wiper).

Because the volume control in non-A.V.C. receivers adjusts R.F. signal levels rather than A.F. signal levels, the volume control must be manipulated while tuning the radio in order to find weak signals.

== Comparison with Alternative Envelope Detectors ==

===Infinite-Impedance Detector===
[[File:Infinite-Impedance Detector circuit - Simple JFET version.gif|thumb|right|Infinite-Impedance Detector (JFET implementation)]] 
The Infinite-Impedance Detector is essentially a plate detector where the output is taken from the ''cathode'' circuit (or ''emitter'', or ''drain'', for transistor implementations) and so has lower output voltage but low distortion.

As with the standard plate detector, the device is biased almost completely off, and positive-going halves of the input signal cause the device to quickly charge C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; up from the positive power supply but the capacitor can only be discharged slowly via R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so the circuit acts as a peak detector.

The value of R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would depend on the JFET or triode chosen, and perhaps be a 200 kilohm preset, adjusted to give lowest distortion in the output signal. The time constant of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would be chosen to fall somewhere between the highest audio (modulation) frequency but well below the lowest carrier (modulated) frequency encountered. The [[Radio Frequency|RF]] filter in the supply line, C4 and the RFC ([[Choke (electronics)#RF Chokes|RF Choke]]), is less essential than in the original plate detector, but can reduce inter-stage RF interference and instability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9491">A '''grid-leak detector''' is a [[thermionic valve]] (UK, Australia, NZ etc.), or [[vacuum tube]] (USA), circuit used in older [[vacuum tube]] [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] [[radio]] receivers, which served as a combination amplifier and [[detector (radio)|detector]] ([[rectifier]]) to extract the [[audio signal]] from the modulated [[radio frequency]] signal.   The tube used a '''grid leak''' circuit to generate the DC [[control grid|grid]] [[bias voltage]] necessary for proper operation from grid current that occurs in all vacuum tubes due to electrons attracted to the grid during the positive part of the RF cycle.

== History ==
[[File:TRF Schematic.jpg|thumb|alt=Schematic diagram shows six vacuum tubes|A TRF receiver using a grid leak detector (V1).]]
[[File:Gitterblock-VE301B-Audion.png|thumb| A single stage showing a grid-leak detector.]]
The heyday for grid-leak detectors was the 1920s, when battery-operated, multi-dial [[tuned radio frequency receiver]]s using low-mu [[triode]]s with directly heated [[hot cathode|cathodes]] were the norm.  The Zenith Models 11, 12, and 14 are examples of these kinds of radios.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nostalgiaair.org/PagesByModel/848/M0040848.pdf Schematics of Zenith models 11, 12 and 14.]  Three battery-operated [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]] grid-leak models of the 1920s.&lt;/ref&gt;  When indirectly heated cathodes and [[alternating current|AC]] powered receivers were introduced in 1927, most manufacturers switched to [[Plate detector (radio)|plate detector]]s, and later to [[diode detector]]s.

Although the [[Regenerative circuit|regenerative]] grid-leak detector was one of the more sensitive detectors of its day, its ability to radiate radio frequency energy when improperly adjusted limited its use in urban settings where multiple [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]] would be operated in close proximity.  The RCA Radiola III and IIIa and the Crosley Model 51 are examples of regenerative receivers from this period.

==Grid leak bias==
A valve has a [[resistor]] connected from grid to ground, typically as the only [[biasing|bias]] component.{{dubious|reason=needs the coupling capacitor to leak charge; there's no DC current to provide grid bias.|date=February 2015}} Thus grid leak [[Electric current|current]] is used to bias the valve. Resistors in the region of 1 Megohm were common.

When the grid leak stage had a [[transformer]] input, the valve grid connected to one end of the transformer secondary, and the other end of the secondary went to ground via the grid leak resistor and a small bypass capacitor.{{dubious|reason=these connections not required; may use same config as above or connect RC to grid|date=February 2015}}

The use of grid leak bias competed with use of a so-called [[Battery (vacuum tube)#C battery|C battery]] for providing a fixed negative voltage on the grid.{{dubious|GL was a method of obviating the C battery. GL does not provide a fixed negative voltage on the grid; with no signal, the bias goes to zero.|date=February 2015}} When vacuum tubes came to be constructed with [[cathode]]s electrically isolated from their filaments, it became possible to use [[cathode bias]]ing. This involved use of a [[resistor]] from the cathode to ground, which provides better control of anode current through negative feedback. This method also requires a relatively large [[capacitor]] across the cathode resistor to avoid losing AC gain (through negative feedback), and the cost of a sufficiently sized capacitor was an issue in the pre-war years, as capacitors had low capacity per volume and per cost.

==Grid leak detector==
The grid leak detector was in common use in the 1920s and 30s in [[radio]] receivers. The grid leak detector stage is a non-linear [[valve amplifier]]. The grid bias produced by the grid leak across the biassing grid leak resistor, plus the typically non-linear characteristic of the valves chosen, result in a non-linear rf amplifying stage.{{dubious|reason=yes, tube's IV curve is typically nonlinear, but that's not the fundamental trick; transconductance could be linear and it would still work; grid bias is changing; small tau compared to grid leak|date=February 2015}} The stage performs two, or more often three functions:
* Detection: The nonlinearity of the grid in the stage produces an [[audio frequency]] detected component in the anode load.
* Amplification: The stage amplifies the [[Radio frequencies|RF]] plus [[Audio frequencies|audio]] at the grid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Radio Amateur's Handbook|year=1978|publisher=The American Radio Relay League|page=241|edition=55|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus it gives much better sensitivity than a [[diode]] [[detector]].
* Reaction{{Clarify|date=April 2011}}: In most cases a small amount of [[positive feedback]] was added to give reaction (aka [[Regenerative circuit|regeneration]]) to boost RF sensitivity, selectivity and often output volume.  The term &quot;reaction&quot; means the same as &quot;regeneration&quot;, but &quot;reaction&quot; is more common in British usage.

In simple one-valve sets, the grid leak detector directly drove the headphones, since it produced enough audio frequency output from local (and some distant) stations as well as radio frequency. In better sets, the grid leak detector's output fed - after filtering out the RF -  an audio amplifying valve, or occasionally more than one.

== Operation ==

In the circuit, the grid of the detector (usually a low-mu or medium-mu triode) is connected to the secondary of the final [[Radio Frequency|RF]] or [[Intermediate Frequency|IF]] transformer through a capacitor, the &quot;grid leak capacitor&quot; of 100 pF to 330 pF, with 250 pF being typical.  A large resistor, the &quot;grid leak resistor&quot; of a few hundred kΩ to 10 MΩ is connected either in parallel with this capacitor, or from the detector's grid to ground.  The resistor-capacitor combination, in concert with the nearly unidirectional current flow of the detector's grid-to-cathode (or grid-to-filament, if it's directly heated) circuit, forms a clamp circuit.  The incoming modulated radio frequency signal voltage swings both positive and negative with respect to ground as it emerges from the final RF or IF stage.  The detector's grid-to-cathode circuit will only conduct current when the grid is positive with respect to the cathode.  The resulting current flow charges the capacitor to maintain a voltage which biases the detector grid negative with respect to its cathode.  The amount of bias varies based on the received signal strength.  The grid leak resistor - capacitor circuit is designed to have a time constant which is slightly slower than the rate of change of the audio program and much slower than the rate of change of the carrier.  
Because the bias varies depending on signal strength, plate current will rise on very low signals, and operation near cut-off of the tube will cause distortion. On receivers with battery powered heaters, the heater power supply could be used to bias the tube with a small positive voltage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Radiotron Designers Handbook]]'', 4th Edition, pp. 1082-1084&lt;/ref&gt;
The nearly unidirectional current flow of the received, modulated signal results in a separate audio signal that is said to be '''detected''' or '''demodulated'''.  The triode detector tube also amplifies this audio signal, thereby providing two processes in one tube.  Regenerative detectors often used grid leak, especially in the detection of amplitude modulated signals.

The grid leak detector circuit output, often taken from the plate of the detector tube, may require additional filtering to remove remnants of the carrier portion of the received signal.  RF chokes and/or capacitors may be employed.

== Advantages ==

A grid-leak detector provides demodulation as well as amplification of the audio signal, unlike a classical diode/crystal detector.

==Disadvantages==

One potential disadvantage of the grid leak detector is that the input impedance of the detector may be affected by the need to self bias the detector tube with grid current.  Having the grid leak resistor, even in the Megohm range, shunting signal to ground loads the received signal.  Although this may be mitigated to some degree by taking the resistor to the top of the tuned circuit (i.e. in parallel with the capacitor) and through the coil to earth, or by circuit design and component optimization, forward grid current will still load the input signal (and reduce the Q of the tuned circuit). [[Plate detector (radio)|Plate detector]]s have the advantage in that they isolate the detector load from the input circuit more effectively and may be employed where sensitivity is thought to be otherwise compromised by a grid leak or diode detector circuit.

For industrial valves (flow control) see [[British Valve and Actuator Association]]  

'''British  radio and Valve manufacturers Association''' ('''BVA''') was a [[cartel]] of radio [[vacuum tube|valve]] manufacturers in the [[United Kingdom]] of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) that was designed to protect their interests from foreign competition.  This cartel dictated (among other things), the price of valves (vacuum tubes) and how they were numbered (supposedly designed to make it difficult to identify American equivalents, which were typically half the price [retail] in the United States of America [USA]); however USA types manufactured in the UK by companies such as Brimar sold at the same price as their UK counterparts due to the BVA's insistence. All manufacturers eventually published their own lists of 'equivalents' between their own valves and those of other manufacturers including American types, so cross-referencing became easy, in the UK at least. 

The BVA dictated that no more than one electrode structure could be contained within one envelope.  This latter point was because the BVA levied a charge of initially £1 per valveholder, to cover royalties on any of its members' patent rights.  Pressure from set makers for multi-structure valves to overcome the BVA's edict led to British and European manufacturers introducing many multi-structure valves and these eventually became the norm. 

The British radio set makers were now able to adopt multi-structure valve designs. One German manufacturer produced a multi-structure valve that contained not only all the electrode structures for a complete radio receiver, but many of the passive components as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiomuseum-bocket.de/wp/en/loewe-3nf-tube Privates Loewe Opta Radiomuseum Bocket]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Triode_Circuit.svg|thumb|A generic triode circuit showing &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; batteries]]

In the early days of [[electronics]], [[vacuum tube]] devices (such as radios) were powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]]. Each battery had a different designation depending on which '''vacuum tube''' element it was associated with.

Initially, the only such device was a [[Diode#Thermionic and gaseous state diodes|diode]] with only a [[electrical filament|filament]] [[Cathode#Vacuum tubes|(cathode)]] and a [[Plate electrode|plate]] [[Anode#Vacuum tube anode|(anode)]]. Following the direction of electron flow, these electrodes were identified as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, respectively and thus the associated batteries were referred to as the [[#A battery|&quot;A&quot; battery]] and [[#B battery|&quot;B&quot; battery]], respectively. Later, when the [[control grid]] element was added to create the [[triode]] tube, it was logically assigned the letter &quot;C&quot; and supplied from a [[#C battery|&quot;C&quot; battery]]. Subsequent addition of further internal elements to improve the performance of the triode did not require an extension to this series of batteries &amp;ndash; these elements were either [[Voltage divider#Resistive divider|resistively-biased]] from the existing batteries, connected to ground or to the cathode.

This nomenclature was used primarily within North America. Different battery names were used elsewhere in the English speaking world.

==A battery==

An '''A battery''' is any battery used to provide power to the filament of a vacuum tube. It is sometimes colloquially referred to as a &quot;[[Battery (electricity)#Wet_cell|wet battery]]&quot;. (A dry cell could be used for the purpose, but the ampere-hour capacity of dry cells was too low at the time to be of practical use in this service). The term comes from the days of valve (tube) radios when it was common practice to use a dry battery for the plate (anode) voltage and a rechargeable lead/acid &quot;wet&quot; battery for the filament voltage. (The filaments in vacuum tubes consumed much more current than the anodes, and so the &quot;A&quot; battery would drain much more rapidly than the &quot;B&quot; battery; therefore, using a rechargeable &quot;A&quot; battery in this role reduced the need for battery replacement. In contrast, a non-rechargeable &quot;B&quot; battery would need to be replaced relatively infrequently.)

A batteries were initially 2 volts, being lead acid accumulators, but with the introduction of all dry battery radios, 1.4 volts became more common. Other voltages can be encountered. For example 7.5 volt batteries were sometimes used to power a series connected set of 1.4 [[volt]] valves (tubes).

In Britain and some other countries, the &quot;A&quot; battery was known as the &quot;LT&quot; (low tension) battery if dry, and simply the &quot;accumulator&quot; if wet.

==B battery==
A '''B battery''' is any battery used to provide the [[plate voltage]] of a vacuum tube. It is sometimes colloquially referred to as a &quot;dry battery&quot; (although there's no reason why a &quot;wet&quot; battery of suitable voltage couldn't be utilised for the purpose).

The [[electrical filament|filament]] is primarily a heat source and therefore the A battery supplies significant [[Electric current|current]] and rapidly discharges. The B battery experiences comparatively little current draw and retains its stored capacity far longer than an A battery. Early B batteries used with bright emitter tubes were 120 volts, but these quickly became obsolete as they were replaced with examples having voltages of typically 45 volts, 67½ volts, or 90 volts as more efficient tubes became available. Some examples had taps every 22½ volts.

Even when the plate voltage rail is fed by a power supply rather than a battery, it is generally referred to as the &quot;B+&quot; line in American schematics.

Because plate voltages can be as high as 300[[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]], multiple B batteries may be connected together in series to additively provide the required operating voltages. The much higher available voltage of B batteries means that they must be handled more carefully than other battery types due to their ability to shock and/or burn the person handling them.

In Britain and in some other countries, the &quot;B&quot; battery was known as the &quot;[[HT (vacuum tube)|HT]]&quot; (high tension) battery.

==C battery==
{{dablink|Not to be confused with a [[C battery|C cell]]}}

In [[electronics]], a '''C battery''' is any [[battery (electricity)|battery]] used to provide bias to the [[control grid]] of a [[vacuum tube]]. Until the early 1930s this was common practice in valve (tube) radio sets but was largely superseded by [[grid leak]] [[resistor]]s or [[voltage divider]] [[biasing]].

Grid bias batteries are still manufactured today, but not for radio use. They are popular in schools and colleges as a convenient variable voltage source in science classes. The most popular battery is the 9 volt type with taps every 1½ volts that accept [[banana plug]]s.

A rare form of &quot;C&quot; battery was the ''bias cell'', a button-size miniature battery designed to deliver a constant voltage with no current drain. These were briefly popular between 1936 and 1945 as the bias cell was less costly than a resistor/capacitor bias network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antiquewireless.org/uploads/1/6/1/2/16129770/09-the_mallory_bias_cell.pdf ''The Mallory bias cell'', retrieved 2015 Jun 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and in some other countries, the &quot;C&quot; battery was known as the &quot;GB&quot; (grid bias) battery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4292">A '''vircator''' (VIRtual CAthode oscillaTOR) is a  [[microwave]] generator that is capable of generating brief pulses of tunable, narrow band microwaves at very high power levels. 

[[Image:VIRCATOR.jpg]]

A typical vircator is built inside an [[vacuum|evacuated]] [[resonant cavity]] or [[waveguide]]. An electrode, a [[cold cathode]], at one end injects an intense [[electron beam]], such as from a [[Marx generator]] or a [[flux compression generator]], optionally with a suitable [[pulse forming network]], e.g. a [[Pulse forming network#blumlein|Blumlein]]. The pulse has magnitude in the range of hundred or more kilovolts and duration of about 50-150 nanoseconds. The electrons are attracted to a thin [[anode]], such as an aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] or a [[stainless steel]] mesh, that is connected to the grounded waveguide body. The unit is surrounded by a [[magnet]]. Due to the intensity of the electron beam, many electrons pass through the anode into the region beyond it, forming a virtual [[cathode]]. The electron beam must be so intense as to exceed the [[space charge|space charge limiting current]] in that region, causing oscillations that generate microwaves. The frequency, efficiency and other characteristics of the emitted beam depend on the precise physical configuration and operating parameters. 

A coaxial design exists where the cathode forms an outer ring surrounding the anode cylinder, with the virtual cathode forming along the cylinder's axis. Such design can be directly integrated with a [[waveguide]].

The frequencies are usually in the region of 0.5-1.5, 2-6, 3, or 5-18 GHz. Other frequencies are also possible. Lower frequencies are usable for jamming communications, higher frequencies can be harnessed for their destructive effects on electronics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/military/portable-ebomb-to-be-tested Portable E-Bomb to Be Tested - IEEE Spectrum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vircators have been used as  [[electromagnetic pulse]]  generators and for generating [[X-ray]]s{{cn|reason=This may well be correct, but none of the references mention x-ray generation.|date=February 2011}}. Power levels on the  order of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; watts are possible.

A design successor of a vircator is a [[reditron]], which has higher efficiency and narrower bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.cz/books?id=1Nn9sAJRZfwC&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=vircator&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=vircator&amp;f=false | title = Pulsed High-Power Microwave (HPM) Tubes and Related Technology | isbn = 9780941375962 | author1 = Company | first1 = Diane Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

The massive short pulse of high voltage causes the cathode to emit an intense burst of electrons by the [[field electron emission]] mechanism. The electrons are attracted to the anode. A large proportion of the electrons passes through the anode and forms a cloud behind it, forming the virtual cathode. However, the electrons are still attracted by the anode (and repulsed by each other), so they change direction and fly back towards the anode, only to pass through again and be repulsed by the cathode and attracted towards the anode. The rapidly accelerating and decelerating electrons, as they oscillate back and forth between the real and virtual cathode through the mesh anode at microwave frequencies, then produce electromagnetic radiation.

[[Image:4-1000A linear RF deck build by K5LAD.jpg|thumb|upright|right|4-1000A Power Tube]]

'''The 4-1000A/8166''' is a radial-beam tetrode designed for use in radio transmitters.  The 4-1000A is the largest of a series of tubes including the 4-65A, 4-125A, 4-250A, and the 4-400A.  These tubes share a common naming convention in which the first number identifies the number of elements contained within the tube; ''i.e.'', the number “4” identifies the tube as a tetrode which contains four elements (filament, control grid, screen grid, and anode), and the second number indicates the maximum continuous power dissipation of the anode in Watts.  The entire family of tubes can be used as oscillators, modulators, and amplifiers.

== Specifications ==
The 4-1000A is a relatively large glass tube with an overall height of 9.25 inches and a diameter of 5 inches.  It is designed to operate with its plate (anode) at an orange-red color due to the &quot;getter&quot; being a zirconium compound on the anode structure which requires a great deal of heat to be effective.  The cathode is a directly-heated, [[thorium|thoriated]]-tungsten filament rated at 7.5 volts at 21 [[ampere]]s.  Connections to the filament and grids are made via a special 5-pin socket, and the anode connection is at the top of the tube.  

The tube may be operated as a [[class C amplifier]] in which a single tube can provide up to 3340 watts of RF power.  A pair of tubes may be operated as an audio-frequency [[modulator]] for an AM transmitter; in this case a pair of tubes will provide up to 3,840 watts of audio power. &lt;ref&gt; Data sheet for the Eimac 4-1000A &lt;/ref&gt;

== Internal construction ==
The 4-1000A is of radial construction; the most obvious feature is the large, roughly cylindrical, blackish anode suspended from the top of the tube.  The anode, which may be constructed out of metal or graphite, is finned for increased power dissipation.  The filament and grids are supported from the lower section/base of the tube.  
 
== Source ==
The 4-1000A was available from multiple manufacturers including [[RCA]], &lt;ref&gt;RCA Transmitting Tubes TT4, 1956 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Eimac|EIMAC]],&lt;ref&gt;EIMAC Power Grid Tubes Quick Reference Catalog 175 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Amperex Electronic|AMPEREX]], and Triton.

== Cooling ==
A complete cooling system is required to operate the tube at rated values.  A [[centrifugal fan]] pressurizes the equipment [[chassis]] and provides a continuous stream of cooling air.  A specially designed socket is used to direct the air over the filament and grid connections, and a glass chimney (Pyrex®) then directs the air around the tube's glass envelope; chassis-mounted metal clips are used to center the chimney around the tube.  Finally, a finned, cylindrical [[heat sink]] is attached to the anode connection (top of the tube) to provide additional cooling for the  anode's glass-to-metal seal.

==Variants==
The 4-1000A was modified for operation in pulsed applications; the modified tube, identified as the 4PR1000A/8189, can be operated with anode voltages as high as 30 kV DC and peak plate current of 8.0 Amperes, but at a reduced duty cycle. &lt;ref&gt; Data sheet for EIMAC 8189 / 4PR1000A &lt;/ref&gt;

'''8974 / X-2159''' is a power [[tetrode]] designed for megawatt power levels in industrial and broadcast applications.

== Specifications ==

The 8974 is an external anode tube made of metal and ceramic. It has an overall height of 23.75 inches (603 mm), a diameter of 17.03 inches (433 mm), and weighs 175 pounds (80 kg). It contains a directly heated thoriated-tungsten filament rated at 16.3 volts at approx. 625 amperes. The anode is designed to dissipate 1.25 megawatts,  approximately 1700 [[horsepower]] (1.25 MW * (1341 hp/MW)&amp;nbsp;= 1676 hp). The tube may be operated as a [[class C amplifier]], where a single tube with an anode voltage of 22.5 kV DC can provide up to 2,158 kilowatts of RF power.  &lt;ref&gt; Data sheet for the Eimac 8974 / X-2159 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Internal construction ==

The thoriated-tungsten filament consists of two independent sections mounted on water-cooled supports. The two filaments may be excited in quadrature to reduce hum contributed by an ac power source. Each filament is rated at a nominal value of 16.3 Volts at approx. 625 Amperes for a total of over 20 kilowatts of filament power required when the tube is in operation.

== History ==
Experimental type X2159 was assigned to the development of a power tetrode by [[Eimac]] (then a division of Varian Associates) on May 28, 1970 and the design engineer was Sterling G. McNees. This electron tube was intended for use in very high power medium-frequency broadcast service and VLF communications equipment and as a pulse modulator (as a switch tube). The EIA ([[Electronic Industries Alliance]]) designation 8974 was assigned to this as it became a standard product. The initial technical data sheet was printed in July 1971.

[[Continental Electronics]] of Dallas, Texas designed two 8974s (one as PA and the other as modulator) into their D323 series 1 megawatt AM transmitters which were sold primarily into the middle East, where stations were built to cover large geographical areas. The 8974 is still used in the same transmitters {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, over 30 years later.  The 8974 was also used as the basis for the development of several large tetrode switch tubes capable of operating at anode voltage up to 175 kilovolts dc.

== Cooling ==
The anode is cooled by circulated water via two [[flange]]s located at the top of the tube.  The heat is transferred to the outside environment using a [[radiator]], or to a secondary cooling system using a [[heat exchanger]].  Controlling the purity of the water is important to prevent the formation of copper oxide which would reduce the cooling efficiency.  Impurities could also cause [[electrolysis]] which could destroy the cooling passages. &lt;ref&gt; EIMAC Care and Feeding of Power Grid Tubes, 5th edition, 2003, p. 149-150 &lt;/ref&gt;  The plumbing connections for the water inlet and outlet are made at the anode, where a high DC voltage (up to 22 kV DC) is present.  Forced air is used to provide additional cooling to the filament and grid connections at the bottom of the tube.

[[Image:Getter diagram.png|thumb|right|300px|''(center)'' A vacuum tube with a &quot;flashed getter&quot; coating on the inner surface of the top of the tube. ''(left)'' The inside of a similar tube, showing the reservoir that holds the material that is evaporated to create the getter coating. During manufacture, after the tube is evacuated and sealed, an [[induction heater]] evaporates the material, which condenses on the glass. ]]

A '''getter''' is a deposit of reactive material that is placed inside a [[vacuum]] system, for the purpose of completing and maintaining the vacuum. When gas molecules strike the getter material, they combine with it chemically or by [[adsorption]]. Thus the getter removes small amounts of gas from the evacuated space.

The getter is usually a coating applied to a surface within the evacuated chamber.

A vacuum is initially created by connecting a closed container to a [[vacuum pump]]. After achieving a vacuum, the container can be sealed, or the vacuum pump can be left running.   Getters are especially important in sealed systems, such as [[vacuum tube]]s, including [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs), and [[vacuum insulated panel]]s, which must maintain a vacuum for a long time.  This is because the inner surfaces of the container release adsorbed gases for a long time after the vacuum is established.  The getter continually removes this residual gas as it is produced.   Even in systems which are continually evacuated by a vacuum pump, getters are also used to remove residual gas, often to achieve a higher vacuum than the pump could achieve alone.  Although it weighs almost nothing and has no moving parts, a getter is itself a vacuum pump.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Hanlon&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Getters cannot react permanently with [[inert gas]]es, though some getters will adsorb them in a reversible fashion. Also, [[hydrogen]] is usually handled by adsorption rather than reaction.

Small amounts of gas within a vacuum tube will ionize, causing undesired conduction leading to major malfunction.  Small amounts of gas within a vacuum insulated panel can greatly compromise its insulation value. Getters help to maintain the vacuum.

==Types==
To avoid being contaminated by the atmosphere, the getter must be introduced into the vacuum system in an inactive form during assembly, and activated after evacuation. This is usually done by heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Espe&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Espe |first=Werner |author2=Max Knoll |author3=Marshall P. Wilder|title=Getter materials for electron tubes |journal=Electronics |pages=80–86|publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=October 1950 |url=http://www.tubebooks.org/file_downloads/Getter_Material.pdf |issn=0883-4989 |accessdate=21 October 2013}} on Pete Miller's [http://www.tubebooks.org/ Tubebooks] website&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of getter use different ways of doing this:
*''Flashed getter'' – The getter material is held inactive in a reservoir during assembly, then heated and evaporated after initial evacuation, usually by [[induction heating]]. The vaporized getter, usually a volatile metal, instantly reacts with any residual gas, then condenses on the cool walls of the tube in a thin coating, the ''getter spot'' or ''getter mirror'', which continues to absorb gas. This is the most common type, used in low power [[vacuum tube]]s.
*''Non-evaporable getter'' (NEG)&lt;ref name=&quot;Jousten&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Jousten |first=Karl |title=Handbook of Vacuum Technology |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2008 |pages=463–474 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Gco_ytUu4QYC&amp;pg=PA463 |isbn=3-527-40723-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The getter remains in solid form.
**''Coating getter'' – a coating applied to metal parts of the vacuum system that will be heated during use. Usually a nonvolatile metal powder sintered in a porous coating to the surface of the electrodes of power vacuum tubes, maintained at temperatures of 200° to 1200&amp;nbsp;°C during operation.
**''Bulk getter'' – sheets, strips, wires or sintered pellets of gas absorbing metals which are heated, either by mounting them on hot components or by a separate heating element. These can often be renewed or replaced
**''Getter pump'' or ''sorption pump'' – In laboratory vacuum systems the bulk NEG getter is often held in a separate vessel with its own heater, attached to the vacuum system by a valve, so that it can be replaced or renewed when saturated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jousten&quot; /&gt;
***''Ion getter pump'' – Uses a high voltage electrode to [[ionize]] the gas molecules and drive them into the getter surface. These can achieve very low pressures and are important in [[ultrahigh vacuum]] (UHV) systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jousten&quot; /&gt;

==Flashed getters==
[[File:Opachki dead vacuum luminescent display bednyaga da.JPG|thumb|right|Dead [[vacuum fluorescent display]] (air has leaked in and getter spot became white)]]
Flashed getters are prepared by arranging a reservoir of volatile and reactive material inside the vacuum system. Once the system is evacuated and sealed, the material is heated (usually by radio frequency [[induction heating]]). After evaporating, it is deposited as a coating on the interior surfaces of the system. Flashed getters (typically made with [[barium]]) are commonly used in [[vacuum tube]]s. The getter usually be seen as a silvery metallic spot on the inside of the tube's glass envelope. Large transmission tubes and specialty systems often use more exotic getters, including [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]], [[strontium]], [[caesium]] and [[phosphorus]].

If the getter is exposed to atmospheric air (for example, if the tube breaks or develops a leak), it turns white and becomes useless. For this reason, flashed getters are only used in [[sealed systems]]. A functioning phosphorus getter looks very much like an oxidised metal getter, although it has an [[iridescent]] pink or orange appearance which oxidised metal getters lack. Phosphorus was frequently used before metallic getters were developed.

In systems which need to be opened to air for maintenance, a [[titanium sublimation pump]] provides similar functionality to flashed getters, but can be flashed repeatedly. Alternatively, nonevaporable getters may be used.

Those unfamiliar with sealed vacuum devices, such as [[vacuum tubes]]/thermionic valves, [[high pressure sodium lamp]]s or some types of [[metal-halide lamp]]s, are often mistaken into thinking the flash getter deposit is caused as a result of the failure of the device. Note that contemporary high intensity discharge lamps tend to use non-evaporable getters rather than flash getters.

Those familiar with such devices can often make qualitative assessments as to the hardness or quality of the vacuum within by the appearance of the flash getter deposit. A shiny deposit indicating a good vacuum. As the getter is used, the deposit often becomes thin and translucent particularly at the edges. It can take on a brownish-red semi translucent appearance and this indicates poor seals or extensive use of the device at elevated temperatures. A white deposit, usually of barium oxide indicates total failure of the seal on the vacuum system. as depicted in the fluorescent display module depicted below.

===Activation===
The typical flashed getter used in small vacuum tube (thermionic valve) ''(seen in 12AX7 tube, top)'' consists of a ring shaped structure made from a long strip of nickel, bent up into a long, narrow trough and then folded into the ring shape with the trough opening facing upwards in the specific case depicted above. The trough is filled with a mixture of [[barium azide]] and powdered glass.

During activation, whilst the bulb is still on the pump, an R.F. [[induction heating]] coil connected to a powerful [[electronic oscillator|R.F. oscillator]] operating in the 27&amp;nbsp;MHz or 40.68Mz [[ISM band]] is positioned around the bulb in the plane of the ring. The coil acts as the primary of a transformer and the ring as a single shorted turn. Large R. F. currents flow in the ring, heating it. The coil is moved along the axis of the bulb so as not to overheat and melt the ring. Once the ring is heated the barium azide decomposes into barium vapor and nitrogen. The nitrogen is pumped out and the barium condenses on the bulb above the plane of the ring forming a mirror like deposit with a large surface area. The powdered glass in the ring melts and entraps any particles which could otherwise escape loose inside the bulb causing later problems. The barium combines with any free gas when activated and continues to act after the bulb is sealed off from the pump. During use, the internal electrodes and other parts of the tube get hot. This can cause adsorbed gases to be released from metallic parts, such as anodes (plates), grids or non metallic—but porous—parts, such as sintered ceramic parts. The gas is trapped on the large area of reactive barium on the bulb wall and removed from the tube.

==Non-evaporable getters==
{{main|Non-Evaporable Getter}}
''Non-evaporable getters'' which work at high temperature generally consist of a film of a special alloy, often primarily [[zirconium]]; the requirement is that the alloy materials must form a passivation layer at room temperature which disappears when heated.
Common alloys have names of the form St (Stabil) followed by a number:
*St 707 is 70% [[zirconium]], 24.6% [[vanadium]] and the balance [[iron]],
*St 787 is 80.8% [[zirconium]], 14.2% [[cobalt]] and balance [[mischmetal]],
*St 101 is 84% [[zirconium]] and 16% [[aluminium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5961750-description.html Nonevaporable getter alloys - US Patent 5961750]&lt;/ref&gt;
In tubes used in electronics, the getter material coats plates within the tube which are heated in normal operation; when getters are used within more general vacuum systems, such as in [[semiconductor manufacturing]], they are introduced as separate pieces of equipment in the vacuum chamber, and turned on when needed.

It is of course important not to heat the getter when the system is not already in a good vacuum.

The type '''955 triode''' &quot;[[acorn tube]]&quot;  is a small [[triode]]  [[thermionic valve]] ([[vacuum tube]] in USA) designed primarily to operate at high frequency; although data books specify an upper limit of 400–600&amp;nbsp;MHz, some circuits may obtain gain up to about 900&amp;nbsp;MHz. Interelectrode [[capacitance]]s and [[Miller effect|Miller capacitances]] are minimized by the small dimensions of the device and the widely separated pins. The connecting pins are placed around the periphery of the bulb and project radially outward: this maintains short internal leads with low [[inductance]], an important property allowing operation at high frequency. The pins fit a special socket fabricated as a ceramic ring in which the valve itself occupies the central space.

The 955 is one of about a dozen types of &quot;acorn valve&quot;, so called because their size and shape is similar to the [[acorn]] (nut of the oak tree), designed to work in the [[VHF]] range. The 954 and 956 types are sharp and remote cut-off pentodes, respectively, all with indirect 6.3&amp;nbsp;V, 150&amp;nbsp;mA heaters. Types 957, 958 and 959 are for portable equipment and have 1.25&amp;nbsp;V [[Nickel–cadmium battery|NiCd battery]] heaters. The 957 is a medium-mu signal triode, the 958 is a transmitting triode with dual, paralleled filaments for increased emission, and the 959 is a sharp cut-off pentode like the 954. The 957 and 959 draw 50&amp;nbsp;mA heater current, the 958 twice as much. In 1942, the 958A with tightened emission specs was introduced after it turned out that 958s with excessively high emission kept working after the filament power was turned off, the filament still sufficiently heating on the anode current alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/084/9/957.pdf |title= 957&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;958&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;959 (Acorn Types) |publisher=[[RCA|R.C.A.

==Pin connections==
[[File:AcornTubeSockets.agr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A box of Acorn sockets]]

When viewing the device from above (the end without the exhaust tip), the pins are arranged in a group of three and a group of two, starting with the centre pin in the group of three and going in a clockwise direction, the pins are ''cathode, heater, grid, anode, heater''.

==Ratings==
The 955 is an ''indirectly heated triode'' with heater electrically isolated from the cathode. The heater has a 6.3 volt rating, which it shares with many other common thermionic valves/electron tubes, and it draws about 150 mA.

The maximum anode voltage is 250&amp;nbsp;V, with an anode current of 420&amp;nbsp;microamperes and anode load 250&amp;nbsp;kilohm, and the maximum anode current is 4.5&amp;nbsp;mA at a voltage of 180&amp;nbsp;V with an anode load of 20 kilohm.&lt;ref&gt;Philips Valve Data Book, Philips Electrical Industries Pty. Ltd., 69-73 Clarence Street Sydney, Radio Valve Application Division, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; The 955 is designed to be used in the frequency range of 60–600&amp;nbsp;MHz (5-0.5&amp;nbsp;metres wavelength).
The amplification factor obtained is between 20 and 25 depending on details of the specific stage design and operating voltage.

The '''807''' is a [[beam tetrode]] [[vacuum tube]], widely used in [[Audio frequency|audio-]] and [[radio-frequency]] power amplifier applications.

==Audio uses==
807s were used in [[Valve audio amplifier|audio power amplifiers]], both for [[public address]] and [[hi-fi]] application, usually being run in push-pull pairs in class AB1 or AB2 giving up to 120 watts of usable power. The plate voltage limit is 750 volts and the screen grid limited to 300 volts. Because of the 300 volt screen grid voltage limit, the 807 cannot be triode connected for high power applications. Failure to observe this precaution will cause screen grid failure. Less commonly a single 807 was used in a pure class-A, single-ended audio output stage delivering about 10 watts.

The 807 is not a good choice of tube for typical [[Ultra-Linear]] amplifier circuits, as the maximum screen voltage at 300 V is less than half the maximum plate voltage of 750 V. A possible solution is to use an output transformer with a separate ultralinear screen winding, such as the [[Acrosound]] TO-350.

==RF uses==
The 807 is fully rated to 60&amp;nbsp;MHz, derated to 55% at 125&amp;nbsp;MHz in Class C, Plate-modulated operation, thus they were popular with [[amateur radio]] operators (radio hams). 
In this application a single 807 could be run in class-C as an oscillator or amplifier which could be keyed on and off to transmit [[Morse Code]] in [[Continuous wave|CW]] mode. For voice transmission on [[amplitude modulation|AM]] a final amplifier with one or more 807s, up to about four, could be connected in parallel running class-C. Connecting multiple 807s in parallel produced more power to feed to the antenna. Often the modulator stage (simply a transformer-coupled audio amplifier for A.M., with the secondary of its output transformer in series with the anode supply of the final amplifier), was also constructed using 807s. Many hams found multiple paralleled 807s a cheaper alternative to a single larger valve, such as a single 813, as many military surplus 807s became available cheaply after World War II. In Australia 807s are affectionately referred to as &quot;[[beer bottle#Stubby|stubbies]]&quot; because they are almost as ubiquitous as that common Australian beer container.&lt;br /&gt;
The class C operational values in the info box at the right are for ''anode modulated A.M. operation''; for CW operation a maximum anode voltage of 600 is permissible, whereby the anode current increases to 100 mA and the anode/plate dissipation rises to 25 watts. The screen voltage is the same, at 300, but its dissipation rises to 3.5 watts.
37 watts of R.F. power is produced from 220&amp;nbsp;mW of drive but only a 50% [[duty cycle]] is allowed. The maximum allowable negative ''control grid, g1'' excursion allowable is -200 volts and average control grid current is 5mA in both A.M. and CW modes.&lt;ref&gt;R.C.A. Air-Cooled Transmitting Tubes, Technical Manual TT3, R.C.A. Manufacturing Company Ltd. Harrison, New Jersey, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;
Later versions could be used on CW with a supply voltage up to 750 V and a current of 100 mA to produce 50-55 watts of output power.

==Differences from 6L6==
The electrically similar [[6L6]] was not favored by hams because high transient voltages on the anode when operating in class C could cause a [[electric arc|flashover]] between pins 2 and 3 on the octal base, whereas the 807 had the anode connected to a top cap, physically distant from all the base pins.

==Derivatives==
The 1624 (VT-165) is an 807 variant with a directly heated filamentary cathode operating at 2.5 V, 2 A.

The 1625 (VT-136) is an 807 variant with a 12.6 V heater and a 7-pin base. These tubes were used as RF power amplifiers in some of the SCR-274 and [[AN/ARC-5]] &quot;command set&quot; transmitters of WW2. Postwar, 1625 tubes flooded the surplus market, and were available for pennies apiece. Surplus 1625s found some commercial use, notably the use of a pair as modulator tubes in the [[Heathkit#Early_DX-series_transmitters|Heathkit DX-100 amateur transmitter.]]

The HY-69 is an 807 variant with a 5-pin base and a directly heated filamentary cathode operating at 6.3 V, 1.6 A.

The 5933/807W is a ruggedized military version of the 807. It uses a shorter, straight-sided T12 bulb, which provides better element support for improved microphonics and shock/vibration resistance.

The 807 also found some use as a horizontal output tube in early TV receivers, particularly those manufactured by [[DuMont Laboratories|DuMont]]. The 807 design (with some &quot;[[value engineering]]&quot; to reduce production cost) was the basis for the first application-specific horizontal sweep tubes such as the 6BG6G and 6CD6G. The redesign mainly involved the omission of some of the internal RF shielding, and the substitution of a bakelite octal base for the micanol or ceramic 5-pin.

In turn, these low cost sweep tube derivatives found some use as RF power amplifiers in [[Amateur radio homebrew|homebrew]] [[amateur radio]] transmitters in the 1950s.

==Slang==
Ham operators in the [[United States|US]] sometimes use the term &quot;807&quot; to refer to bottles of beer due to the shape of the tube.&lt;ref name=QRZ&gt;{{cite web|title=Ham Speak - Know the Lingo|url=http://www.qrz.com/i/hamspeak.html|publisher=QRZ.com|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photomultiplier schema en.png|thumb||upright=1.3|Secondary emission used in a [[photomultiplier tube]]. The initial electrons emitted when light strikes a photocathode are made to strike a dynode electrode, knocking out more electrons, which strike a second dynode.  Each incident electron produces multiple secondary electrons, so the cascaded dynode chain amplifies the initial electrons.]] 

'''Secondary emission''' in [[physics]] is a phenomenon where primary incident [[particles]] of sufficient [[energy]], when hitting a surface or passing through some material, induce the emission of secondary particles.  The term often refers to the emission of [[electron]]s when [[charged particle]]s like [[electron]]s or [[ion]]s in a [[vacuum tube]] strike a metal surface; these are called [[secondary electrons]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Kollath, Secondary electron emission of solids irradiated by electrons, Encyclopedia of Physics (ed. S. Flügge) Vol. 21, p. 232 - 303 (1956, in German)&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the number of secondary electrons emitted per incident particle is called '''secondary emission yield'''. If the secondary particles are ions, the effect is termed secondary ion emission.  Secondary electron emission is used in [[photomultiplier tube]]s and [[image intensifier]] tubes to amplify the small number of [[photoelectron]]s produced by photoemission, making the tube more sensitive.  It also occurs as an undesireable side effect in electronic [[vacuum tube]]s when electrons from the [[cathode]] strike the [[anode]], and can cause [[parasitic oscillation]].

== Applications ==

=== Secondary emissive materials ===

Commonly used secondary emissive materials include
* alkali antimonide
* beryllium oxide (BeO)
* magnesium oxide (MgO)
* gallium phosphide (GaP)
* gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP)
* lead oxide (PbO)

=== Photo multipliers and similar devices ===

In a [[photomultiplier]] tube,&lt;ref&gt;H. Semat, J.R. Albright, Introduction to Atomic and Nuclear Physics, 5th ed., ch. 4.12, Chapman and Hall, London (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; one or more electrons are emitted from a [[photocathode]] and accelerated towards a polished metal electrode (called a [[dynode]]). 
They hit the electrode surface with sufficient energy to release a number of electrons through secondary emission. These new electrons are then accelerated towards another dynode, and the process is repeated several times, resulting in an overall gain ('electron multiplication') in the order of typically one million and thus generating an electronically detectable current pulse at the last dynodes.

Similar [[electron multiplier]]s can be used for detection of fast particles like electrons or ''ions''

== Historic applications ==
[[File:Oscilloscopeabc.jpg|thumbnail|right|The display on an oscilloscope at normal intensity.]]
[[File:Oscilloscopeabcde.jpg|thumbnail|right|The same tube with greater intensity. The disk around the dot in the center is due to secondary emission. Electrons are struck off the screen and travel backwards into the tube. The voltage across the tube causes them to be accelerated forward again, striking the screen over a wide area.{{cn|date=April 2013}}]]

=== Special amplifying tubes ===

In the 1930s special amplifying tubes were developed which deliberately &quot;folded&quot; the electron beam, by having it strike a dynode to be reflected into the anode. This had the effect of increasing the plate-grid distance for a given tube size, increasing the transconductance of the tube and reducing its noise figure. A typical such &quot;orbital beam hexode&quot; was the RCA 1630, introduced in 1939. Because the heavy electron current in such tubes damaged the dynode surface rapidly, their lifetime tended to be very short compared to conventional tubes.

=== Early computer memory tubes ===

The first [[random access]] computer memory used a type of [[cathode ray tube]] called the [[Williams tube]] that used secondary emission to store bits on the tube face. Another random access computer memory tube based on secondary emission was the [[Selectron tube]]. Both were made obsolete by the invention of [[magnetic core memory]].

=== Undesirable effects - the tetrode ===
Secondary emission can be undesirable such as in the [[tetrode]] [[thermionic valve]] (tube).  In this instance the positively charged [[screen grid]] can accelerate the electron stream sufficiently to cause secondary emission at the [[anode]] ([[Plate electrode|plate]]).  This can give rise to excessive screen grid current.  It is also partly responsible for this type of valve (tube), particularly early types with anodes not treated to reduce secondary emission, exhibiting a '[[negative resistance]]' characteristic, which could cause the tube to become unstable.  This side effect could be put to use by using some older valves (e.g., type 77 pentode) as [[dynatron]] [[oscillator]]s.  This effect was prevented by adding a third grid to the tetrode, called the suppressor grid, to repel the electrons back toward the plate.  This tube was called the [[pentode]].

== Features ==
The KT88 fits a standard eight-pin [[Tube socket#Octal base|octal]] socket and has similar [[pinout]] and applications as the [[6L6]] and [[EL34]]. Specifically designed for audio amplification, the KT88 has similar ratings to the [[United States|American]] [[6550]] which was designed for use as a servo amplifier. It is one of the largest tubes in its class and can handle significantly higher plate [[voltage]]s than similar tubes, up to 800 [[volts]]. A KT88 [[Push–pull output|push-pull]] pair in class AB1 fixed bias is capable of 100 [[watt]]s of output with 2.5% total harmonic distortion or up to about 50W at low distortion in [[hi-fi]] applications. The transmitting tubes TT21 and TT22 have almost identical transfer characteristics to KT88 but a different pinout, and by virtue of their [[anode]] being connected to the top cap have a higher plate voltage rating (1.25 [[kilovolt]]) and a higher power output capability of 200 watts in class AB1 push–pull.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vintage-technology.info/pages/valves/geckt88.htm ''Vintage Technology, KT88''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[screen grid]] is sometimes tied to the anode so that it becomes effectively a [[triode]] with a lower maximum power output, but considered by discerning audiophiles{{Who|date=September 2015}} to have superior sonic quality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== History ==
The KT88 was introduced by GEC in 1956 as a larger variant of the [[KT66]]. It was manufactured in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] by the MOV ([[Marconi-Osram Valve]]) subsidiary of [[The General Electric Company plc|G.E.C]], also labelled as IEC/Mullard, and, in the U.S., Genelex ''Gold Lion''.

[[File:Kt88 power tubes in traynor yba200 amplifier.jpg|thumb|left|Four KT88s installed and powered.]]
Current production of the KT88 is limited to Shuguang ([[China]]), JJ Electronic ([[Slovakia]]) and [[Russia]] manufactured by [[New Sensor Corporation]]. [[New old stock|NOS]] examples in good condition are extremely rare and quite expensive. Good, current supply of this valve make it popular in contemporary [[hi-fi]] production amplifiers.

Historically, it has been far more popular with high fidelity stereo manufacturers than [[guitar]] amplifier builders, given its characteristics of high-power and low-distortion.  Due to these characteristics, it is regularly used to replace 6550 tubes by end users seeking a guitar amplifier tone with less distortion.  Some of the amplifiers which shipped with the KT88 power tube include the [[Hiwatt]] Custom 200 and 400 Bass Heads, Sound City L/B 200, 200 watt [[Marshall Major]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fliegler|first=Ritchie|title=Amps!: the other half of rock 'n' roll|year=1993|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-7935-2411-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NgG8bmBayLwC&amp;pg=PA15|author2=Jon F.

The '''cavity magnetron''' is a high-powered [[vacuum tube]] that generates [[microwave]]s using the interaction of a stream of [[electron]]s with a [[magnetic field]] while moving past a series of open metal cavities ([[cavity resonator]]s). Bunches of electrons passing by the openings to the cavities excite radio wave oscillations in the cavity, much as a guitar's  strings excite sound in its sound box.  The [[frequency]] of the microwaves produced, the [[resonant frequency]], is determined by the cavities' physical dimensions.  Unlike other microwave tubes, such as the [[klystron]] and [[traveling-wave tube]] (TWT), the magnetron cannot function as an [[amplifier]], increasing the power of an applied microwave signal, it serves solely as an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]], generating a microwave signal from direct current power supplied to the tube.

The first form of magnetron tube, the split-anode magnetron, was invented by [[Albert Hull]] in 1920, but it wasn't capable of high frequencies and was little used.  Similar devices were experimented with by many teams through the 1920s and 30s. On November 27, 1935, [[Hans Hollmann|Hans Erich Hollmann]] applied for a patent for the first multiple cavities magnetron, which he received on July 12, 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|2123728|« Magnetron » of [[Hans Hollmann|Hans Erich Hollmann]], requested by [[Telefunken|Telefunken GmbH]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the more stable [[klystron]] was preferred for most [[History of radar#Germany|German radars]] during [[World War II]]. The cavity magnetron tube was later improved by [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]] and [[Harry Boot]] in 1940 at the [[University of Birmingham]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Magnetron |url=http://histru.bournemouth.ac.uk/Oral_History/Talking_About_Technology/radar_research/the_magnetron.html |date=1995–2009 |publisher=Bournemouth University |accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high power of pulses from their device made centimeter-band [[radar]] practical for the [[Allies of World War II]], with shorter wavelength radars allowing detection of smaller objects from smaller antennas.

In the post-war era the magnetron became less widely used in the radar role. This was because the magnetron's output changes from pulse to pulse, both in frequency and phase. This makes the signal unsuitable for pulse-to-pulse comparisons, which is widely used for detecting and removing &quot;[[Clutter (radar)|clutter]]&quot; from the radar display.&lt;ref name=brookner&gt;Eli Brookner, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5565574 &quot;From $10,000 Magee to $7 Magee and $10 Transmitter and Receiver (T/R) on Single Chip&quot;], IEEE&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetron remains in use in some radars, but has become much more common as a low-cost microwave source for [[microwave oven]]s. In this form, approximately one billion magnetrons are in use today.&lt;ref name=brookner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ma, L. &quot;[http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/antennas/documents/thesis_LiliMA.pdf 3D Computer Modeling of Magnetrons].&quot; University of London Ph.D. Thesis.''

==Construction and operation==

===Hull or single-anode magnetron===
In a conventional electron tube ([[vacuum tube]]), [[electrons]] are emitted from a negatively charged, heated component called the [[cathode]] and are attracted to a positively charged component called the [[anode]]. The components are normally arranged concentrically, placed within a tubular-shaped container from which all air has been evacuated, so that the electrons can move freely (hence the name &quot;vacuum&quot; tubes, called &quot;valves&quot; by the British). In an electron tube, the &quot;current&quot; of electrons emitted by the cathode can flow in only one direction, from the cathode to the anode.  This property can be used to convert bi-directional current flow &quot;alternating current,&quot; to one-directional current flow &quot;direct current,&quot; a process known as &quot;[[rectifier|rectification]].&quot; A tube used for this purpose (usually called a &quot;rectifier&quot; tube) has only two electrodes (which is why it is called a &quot;[[diode]]&quot;), a negatively charged cathode, which emits electrons and a positively charged anode, which attracts the electrons that have been emitted by the cathode.  Thus a &quot;current&quot; of electrons flows in one direction only, from the cathode to the anode.  If a source of alternating current is connected between the anode and the cathode, current will only flow during the half of the altenating current cycle when the anode is positive in relation to the cathode, thus the bi-directional &quot;alternating current&quot; is converted to a uni-directional &quot;direct current.&quot; If a third electrode is inserted between the cathode and the anode (called a [[control grid]]), the flow of electrons between the cathode and anode can be regulated by varying the electric charge on this third electrode. This allows the resulting electron tube (called a &quot;[[triode]]&quot; because it now has three electrodes) to function as an &quot;[[amplifier]]&quot; because small variations in the electric charge applied to the control grid will result in identical variations in the much larger current of electrons flowing between the cathode and anode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zipcon.net/~swhite/docs/physics/electronics/Valves.html &quot;Electric Valves: Diodes, Triodes, and Transistors&quot;[]&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of using a grid for control was patented by [[Lee de Forest]], resulting in considerable research into alternate tube designs that would avoid his patents. One concept used a magnetic field instead of an electrical charge to control current flow, leading to the development of the magnetron tube. In this design, the tube was made with two electrodes, typically with the cathode in the form of a metal rod in the center, and the anode as a cylinder around it. The tube was placed between the poles of a [[horseshoe magnet]]&lt;ref name=mag&gt;[http://electriciantraining.tpub.com/14183/css/14183_103.htm &quot;The Magnetron&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; arranged such that the magnetic field was aligned parallel to the axis of the electrodes.

With no magnetic field present, the tube operates as a diode, with electrons flowing directly from the cathode to the anode.  In the presence of the magnetic field, the electrons will experience a force at right angles to their direction of motion, according to the [[left-hand rule]]. In this case, the electrons follow a curved path between the cathode and anode. The curvature of the path can be controlled by varying either the magnetic field, using an [[electromagnet]], or by changing the electrical potential between the electrodes.

At very high magnetic field settings the electrons are forced back onto the cathode, preventing current flow. At the opposite extreme, with no field, the electrons are free to flow straight from the cathode to the anode. There is a point between the two extremes, the '''critical value''' or '''Hull cut-off magnetic field''' (and cut-off voltage), where the electrons just reach the anode. At fields around this point, the device operates similar to a triode. However, magnetic control, due to [[hysteresis]] and other effects, results in a slower and less faithful response to control current than electrostatic control using a control grid in a conventional triode (not to mention greater weight and complexity), so magnetrons saw limited use in conventional electronic designs.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

It was noticed that when the magnetron was operating at the critical value, it would emit energy in the [[radio frequency]] spectrum.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt; This occurs because a few of the electrons, instead of reaching the anode, continue to circle in the space between the cathode and the anode. Due to an effect now known as [[cyclotron radiation]], these electrons radiate radio frequency energy. The effect is not very efficient. Eventually the electrons hit one of the electrodes, so the number in the circulating state at any given time is a small percentage of the overall current. It was also noticed that the frequency of the radiation depends on the size of the tube, and even early examples were built that produced signals in the microwave region.

Early conventional tube systems were limited to the [[high frequency]] bands, and although [[very high frequency]] systems became widely available in the late 1930s, the ultra high frequency and microwave regions were well beyond the ability of conventional circuits. The magnetron was one of the few devices able to generate signals in the microwave band and it was the only one that was able to produce high power at centimeter wavelengths.

===Split-anode magnetron===
[[File:Split-anode magnetron.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Split-anode magnetron from 1935. ''(left)'' The bare tube, about 11 cm high. ''(right)'' Installed for use between the poles of a strong [[permanent magnet]] ]]
The original magnetron was very difficult to keep operating at the critical value, and even then the number of electrons in the circling state at any time was fairly low. This meant that it produced very low-power signals. Nevertheless, as one of the few devices known to create microwaves, interest in the device and potential improvements was widespread.

The first major improvement was the '''split-anode magnetron''', also known as a '''negative-resistance magnetron'''. As the name implies, this design used an anode that was split in two, creating two half-cylinders. When both were charged to the same voltage the system worked like the original model. But by altering the voltage of the two plates, the electron's trajectory could be modified so that they would naturally travel towards the lower voltage side. The plates were connected to an oscillator that reversed the relative voltage of the two plates at a given frequency.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

At any given instant, the electron will naturally be pushed towards the lower-voltage side of the tube. The electron will then oscillate back and forth as the voltage changes. At the same time, a strong magnetic field is applied, stronger than the critical value in the original design. This would normally cause the electron to circle back to the cathode, but due to the oscillating electrical field, the electron instead follows a looping path that continues toward the anodes.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

Since all of the electrons in the flow experienced this looping motion, the amount of RF energy being radiated was greatly improved. And as the motion occurred at any field level beyond the critical value, it was no longer necessary to carefully tune the fields and voltages, and the overall stability of the device was greatly improved. Unfortunately, the higher field also meant that electrons often circled back to the cathode, depositing their energy on it and causing it to heat up. As this normally causes more electrons to be released, it could sometimes lead to a runaway effect.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

===Cavity magnetron===
[[File:Magnetron cutaway drawing.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Cutaway drawing of a cavity magnetron from 1984.  Part of the righthand magnet and copper anode block is cut away to show the cathode and cavities.  This older magnetron uses two horseshoe shaped [[alnico]] magnets, modern tubes use [[rare earth magnet]]s. ]]

The great advance in magnetron design was the '''cavity magnetron''' or '''electron-resonance magnetron''', which works on entirely different principles. In this design the oscillation is created by the physical shaping of the anode, rather than external circuits or fields.

Mechanically, the cavity magnetron consists of a large cylinder of metal with a hole drilled through the center of circular face. A wire acting as the cathode is run down the center of this hole, and the metal block itself forms the anode. Around this hole, known as the &quot;interaction space&quot;, are a number of similar holes drilled parallel to the interaction space, separated only a very short distance away. A small slot is cut between the interaction space and each of these additional holes, the &quot;resonators&quot;. The resulting block looks something like the cylinder on a [[revolver]], with a somewhat larger central hole. (Early models were actually cut using [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt pistol]] jigs.) The parallel sides of the slots acted as a [[capacitor]] while the anode block itself provided an [[inductor]] analog. Thus, each cavity formed its own resonant circuit, the frequency of which was defined by the energy of the electrons and the physical dimensions of the cavity.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

The magnetic field is set to a value well below the critical, so the electrons follow arcing paths towards the anode. When they strike the anode, they cause it to become negatively charged in that region. As this process is random, some areas will become more or less charged than the areas around them. The anode is constructed of a highly conductive material, almost always copper, so these differences in voltage cause currents to appear to even them out. Since the current has to flow around the outside of the cavity, this process takes time. During that time additional electrons will avoid the hot spots and be deposited further along the anode, as the additional current flowing around it arrives too. This causes an oscillating current to form as the current tries to equalize one spot, then another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/waves/magnetron.html &quot;The Magnetron&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oscillating currents flowing around the cavities, and their effect on the electron flow within the tube, causes large amounts of microwave radiofrequency energy to be generated in the cavities. The cavities are open on one end, so the entire mechanism forms a single larger microwave oscillator. A &quot;tap&quot;, normally a wire formed into a loop, extracts microwave energy from one of the cavities. In some systems the tap wire is replaced by an open hole, which allows the microwaves to flow into a [[waveguide]].

As the oscillation takes some time to set up, and is inherently random at the start, subsequent startups will have different output parameters. Phase is almost never preserved, which makes the magnetron difficult to use in [[phased array]] systems. Frequency also drifts pulse to pulse, a more difficult problem for a wider array of radar systems. Neither of these present a problem for [[continuous-wave radar]]s, nor for microwave ovens.

==Common features==
All cavity magnetrons consist of a heated [[cathode]] placed at a high (continuous or pulsed) negative potential created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode is placed in the center of an [[vacuum|evacuated]], lobed, circular chamber. A magnetic field parallel to the filament is imposed by a [[permanent magnet]]. The magnetic field causes the electrons, attracted to the (relatively) positive outer part of the chamber, to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the [[Lorentz force]]. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut along the length of the cavities that open open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each resonant cavity, which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. (This principle of [[cavity resonator]] is very similar to blowing a stream of air across the open top of a glass pop bottle.) A portion of the radiofrequency energy is extracted by a short antenna that is connected to a [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high-gain [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] in the case of radar.

The sizes of the cavities determine the resonant frequency, and thereby the frequency of the emitted microwaves. However, the frequency is not precisely controllable. The operating frequency varies with changes in load [[wave impedance|impedance]], with changes in the supply current, and with the temperature of the tube.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner76&quot;/&gt; This is not a problem in uses such as heating, or in some forms of [[radar]] where the receiver can be synchronized with an imprecise magnetron frequency. Where precise frequencies are needed, other devices, such as the [[klystron]] are used.

The magnetron is a self-oscillating device requiring no external elements other than a power supply.  A well-defined threshold anode voltage must be applied before oscillation will build up; this voltage is a function of the dimensions of the resonant cavity, and the applied magnetic field. In pulsed applications there is a delay of several cycles before the oscillator achieves full peak power, and the build-up of anode voltage must be coordinated with the build-up of oscillator output.&lt;ref name=Turner76&gt;L.W. Turner,(ed),'' Electronics Engineer's Reference Book, 4th ed.'' Newnes-Butterworth, London 1976 ISBN 9780408001687, pages 7-71 to 7-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there are an even number of cavities, two concentric rings can connect alternate cavity walls to prevent inefficient modes of oscillation. This is called Pi strapping because the two straps lock the phase difference between adjacent cavities at Pi radians (180°).

The modern magnetron is a fairly efficient device. In a microwave oven, for instance, a 1.1 kilowatt input will generally create about 700 watts of microwave power, an efficiency of around 65%. (The high-voltage and the properties of the cathode determine the power of a magnetron.) Large [[S band]] magnetrons can produce up to 2.5 megawatts peak power with an average power of 3.75&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner76&quot;/&gt; Some large magnetrons are water cooled. The magnetron remains in widespread use in roles which require high power, but where precise control over frequency and phase is unimportant.

==Applications==

===Radar===
[[File:Magnetron radar assembly 1947.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|9.375&amp;nbsp;GHz 20&amp;nbsp;kW (peak) magnetron assembly for an early commercial airport radar in 1947.  In addition to the magnetron ''(right)'', it contains a TR (transmit/receive) switch tube and the [[superheterodyne]] receiver front end, a 2K25 [[reflex klystron]] tube [[local oscillator]] and a 1N21 [[germanium diode]] mixer. The waveguide aperture ''(left)'' is connected to the waveguide going to the antenna.]] 
{{Main|History of radar#Centimetric radar|l1=History of radar (Centimetric radar)}}

In a [[radar]] set, the magnetron's waveguide is connected to an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]. The magnetron is operated with very short pulses of applied voltage, resulting in a short pulse of high power microwave energy being radiated. As in all primary radar systems, the radiation reflected off a target is analyzed to produce a radar map on a screen.

Several characteristics of the magnetron's output make radar use of the device somewhat problematic. The first of these factors is the magnetron's inherent instability in its transmitter frequency. This instability results not only in frequency shifts from one pulse to the next, but also a frequency shift within an individual transmitted pulse. The second factor is that the energy of the transmitted pulse is spread over a relatively wide frequency spectrum, which requires the receiver to have a correspondingly wide bandwidth. This wide bandwidth allows ambient electrical noise to be accepted into the receiver, thus obscuring somewhat the weak radar echoes, thereby reducing overall receiver [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and thus performance.   The third factor, depending on application, is the radiation hazard caused by the use of high power electromagnetic radiation. In some applications, for example a [[marine radar]] mounted on a recreational vessel, a radar with a magnetron output of 2 to 4 kilowatts is often found mounted very near an area occupied by crew or passengers. In practical use these factors have been overcome, or merely accepted, and there are today thousands of magnetron aviation and marine radar units in service.  Recent advances in aviation weather avoidance radar and in marine radar have successfully replaced the magnetron with [[semiconductor]] microwave oscillators, which have a narrower output frequency range.  These allow a narrower receiver bandwidth to be used, and the higher signal to noise ratio in turn allows a lower transmitter power, reducing exposure to EMR.

===Heating===
[[Image:Magnetron1.jpg|thumb|Magnetron from a [[microwave oven]] with magnet in its mounting box. The horizontal plates form a [[heat sink]], cooled by airflow from a fan.  The magnetic field is produced by two powerful ring magnets, the lower of which is just visible. Almost all modern oven magnetrons are of similar layout and appearance.]]
In [[microwave oven]]s, the waveguide leads to a radio frequency-transparent port into the cooking chamber. As the fixed dimensions of the chamber, and its physical closeness to the magnetron, would normally create standing wave patterns in the chamber, a motorized fan-like ''stirrer'' is placed in the waveguide to randomize the pattern. This is not always effective for larger objects in the chamber, and most modern microwave ovens also include a rotating table for the food to sit on, the ''turntable''.

===Lighting===
In microwave-excited lighting systems, such as a [[sulfur lamp]], a magnetron provides the microwave field that is passed through a waveguide to the lighting cavity containing the light-emitting substance (e.g., sulfur, metal halides, etc.). These lamps are much more complex than other methods of lighting, and not commonly used though efficient.

==History==
In 1912, Swiss physicist [[Heinrich Greinacher]] was looking for new ways to calculate the [[electron mass]]. He settled on a system consisting of a diode with a cylindrical anode surrounding a rod-shaped cathode, placed in the middle of a magnet. The attempt to measure the electron mass failed because he was unable to achieve a good vacuum in the tube. However, as part of this work, Greinacher developed mathematical models of the motion of the electrons in the crossed magnetic and electric fields.&lt;ref&gt;H. Greinacher (1912) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924056112091;view=1up;seq=878 &quot;Über eine Anordnung zur Bestimmung von e/m&quot;] (On an apparatus for the determination of e/m), ''Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft'', '''14''' :  856-864.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radartutorial.eu/04.history/hi80.en.html &quot;Invention of Magnetron&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[Albert Hull]] put this work to use in an attempt to bypass [[Western Electric]]'s patents on the triode, which they had gained by buying [[Lee De Forest]]'s patents on the control of current flow using electric fields via the &quot;grid&quot;. Hull intended to use a variable magnetic field, instead of an electrostatic one, to control the flow of the electrons from the cathode to the anode. Working at [[General Electric]]'s Research Laboratories in [[Schenectady, New York]], Hull built tubes that provided switching through the control of the ratio of the magnetic and electric field strengths. He released several papers and patents on the concept in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Albert W. Hull (1921) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OrYWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;The effect of a uniform magnetic field on the motion of electrons between coaxial cylinders,&quot;] ''Physical Review'', '''18''' (1) : 31-57.  See also:  Albert W. Hull, &quot;The magnetron,&quot; ''Journal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers'', vol. 40, no. 9, pages 715-723 (September 1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hull's magnetron was not originally intended to generate VHF (very-high-frequency) electromagnetic waves.  However, in 1924, Czech physicist August Žáček&lt;ref&gt;Biographical information about August Žáček:

However, the two-pole magnetron, also known as a split-anode magnetron, had relatively low efficiency. The cavity version (properly referred to as a ''resonant-cavity magnetron'') proved to be far more useful. In 1937-1940 a multi-cavity magnetron was built by the British physicist [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]], together with a team of British coworkers, for the British and American military radar installations in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://histru.bournemouth.ac.uk/Oral_History/Talking_About_Technology/radar_research/the_magnetron.html | title = The Magnetron | work = Radar Recollections - A Bournemouth University/CHiDE/HLF project | publisher = Defence Electronics History Society (formerly CHiDE)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[radar]] was being developed during [[World War II]], there arose an urgent need for a high-power [[microwave]] generator that worked at shorter [[wavelength]]s (around 10&amp;nbsp;cm (3&amp;nbsp;GHz)) rather than the 150&amp;nbsp;cm (200&amp;nbsp;MHz) that was available from tube-based generators of the time. It was known that a multi-cavity resonant magnetron had been developed and patented in 1935 by [[Hans Hollmann]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|2123728|Hans Erich Hollmann/Telefunken GmbH: „Magnetron“ filed November 27, 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the German military considered the frequency drift of Hollman's device to be undesirable, and based their radar systems on the [[klystron]] instead.  But klystrons could not at that time achieve the high power output that magnetrons eventually reached.  This was one reason that German [[night fighter]] radars were not a match for their British counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaiser, &quot;The Development of Electron Tubes and of Radar technology: The Relationship of Science and Technology,&quot; pp. 217 - 236 in O. Blumtritt, H. Petzold and W. Aspray, eds., ''Tracking the History of Radar'', IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, USA, 1994:229&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Original cavity magnetron, 1940 (9663811280).jpg|thumb|right|The anode block which is part of the cavity magnetron developed by [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]] and [[Harry Boot]] in 1940 at the [[University of Birmingham]].]]
In 1940, at the [[University of Birmingham]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]] and [[Harry Boot]] produced a working prototype similar to Hollman's cavity magnetron, but added liquid cooling and a stronger cavity. Randall and Boot soon managed to increase its power output 100 fold. Instead of abandoning the magnetron due to its frequency instability, they sampled the output signal and synchronized their receiver to whatever frequency was actually being generated. In 1941, the problem of frequency instability was solved by coupling (&quot;strapping&quot;) alternate cavities within the magnetron.  (For an overview of early magnetron designs, including that of Boot and Randall, see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willshaw|first=W. E.|author2=L. Rushforth |author3=A. G. Stainsby |author4=R.

Because [[France]] had just fallen to the [[Nazi]]s and Britain had no money to develop the magnetron on a massive scale, Churchill agreed that [[Henry Tizard|Sir Henry Tizard]] should offer the magnetron to the Americans in exchange for their financial and industrial help (the [[Tizard Mission]]). An early 10 [[Kilowatt|kW]] version, built in England by the [[General Electric Company plc|General Electric Company]] Research Laboratories, [[Wembley]], [[London]] (not to be confused with the similarly named American company General Electric), was given to the [[US government]] in September 1940. The British magnetron was a thousand times more powerful than the best American transmitter at the time and produced accurate pulses.&lt;ref name=Hind/&gt; At the time the most powerful equivalent microwave producer available in the US (a klystron) had a power of only ten watts. The cavity magnetron was widely used during [[World War II]] in microwave radar equipment and is often credited with giving Allied radar a considerable performance advantage over [[Germany|German]] and [[Japan]]ese radars, thus directly influencing the outcome of the war. It was later described by noted Historian James Phinney Baxter III as &quot;The most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James Phinney Baxter III (Official Historian of the Office of Scientific Research and Development), ''Scientists Against Time'' (Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., 1946), page 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] made a producible version from the magnetron delivered to America by the Tizard Mission, and before the end of 1940, the [[Radiation Laboratory]] had been set up on the campus of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to develop various types of radar using the magnetron. By early 1941, portable centimetric airborne radars were being tested in American and British aircraft.&lt;ref name=Hind&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6331897.stm |title=Briefcase 'that changed the world' |publisher=BBC News |author=Angela Hind |date=February 5, 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1941, the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] in Great Britain used the magnetron to develop a revolutionary airborne, ground-mapping radar codenamed H2S. The [[H2S radar]] was in part developed by [[Alan Blumlein]] and [[Bernard Lovell]].

Centimetric radar, made possible by the cavity magnetron, allowed for the detection of much smaller objects and the use of much smaller antennas. The combination of small-cavity magnetrons, small antennas, and high resolution allowed small, high quality radars to be installed in aircraft. They could be used by maritime patrol aircraft to detect objects as small as a submarine periscope, which allowed aircraft to attack and destroy submerged submarines which had previously been undetectable from the air. Centimetric contour mapping radars like [[H2S radar|H2S]] improved the accuracy of Allied bombers used in the [[strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign]]. Centimetric gun-laying radars were likewise far more accurate than the older technology. They made the big-gunned Allied battleships more deadly and, along with the newly developed [[proximity fuze]], made anti-aircraft guns much more dangerous to attacking aircraft. The two coupled together and used by anti-aircraft batteries, placed along the flight path of German [[V-1 flying bomb]]s on their way to [[London]], are credited with destroying many of the flying bombs before they reached their target.

Since then, many millions of cavity magnetrons have been manufactured; while some have been for radar the vast majority have been for [[microwave oven]]s. The use in radar itself has dwindled to some extent, as more accurate signals have generally been needed and developers have moved to [[klystron]] and [[traveling-wave tube]] systems for these needs.

==Health hazards==

[[Image:D-W003 Warnung vor giftigen Stoffen ty.svg|thumb|150px|right|Caution: Poisonous particles for the lungs]]

Among more speculative hazards, at least one in particular is well known and documented. As the [[Lens (vision)|lens]] of the [[Human eye|eye]] has no cooling blood flow, it is particularly prone to overheating when exposed to microwave radiation. This heating can in turn lead to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in later life.&lt;ref name=Lipman1&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A microwave oven with a warped door or poor microwave sealing can be hazardous.

There is also a considerable electrical hazard around magnetrons, as they require a high voltage power supply.

Some magnetrons have [[beryllium oxide]] (beryllia) ceramic insulators, which are dangerous if crushed and inhaled, or otherwise ingested. Single or chronic exposure can lead to [[berylliosis]], an incurable lung condition. In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]]; therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be directly handled.

All magnetrons contain a small amount of [[thorium]] mixed with [[tungsten]] in their [[Incandescent light bulb#Filament|filament]]. While this is a radioactive metal, the risk of cancer is low as it never gets airborne in normal usage. Only if the filament is taken out of the magnetron and crushed can it pose a health hazard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ansto.gov.au/NuclearFacts/BenefitsofNuclearScience/Inthehome/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineerguy.com/elements/videos/video-microwave.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/thorium.html#exposure&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''video camera tube''' was a type of [[cathode ray tube]] used to capture the [[television]] image prior to the introduction of [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) in the 1980s. Several different types of tubes were in use from the early 1930s to the 1980s.

In these tubes, the [[cathode ray]] was scanned across a target which was illuminated by the scene to be broadcast. The resultant current was dependent on the brightness of the image on the target. The size of the striking ray was tiny compared to the size of the target, allowing 483 horizontal [[scan line]]s per image in the [[NTSC]] format, or 576 lines in [[PAL]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NTSC#Lines and refresh rate]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cathode ray tube==
Any vacuum tube which operates using a focused beam of electrons, &quot;[[cathode ray]]s&quot;, is known as a cathode ray tube (CRT). However, in the popular [[wiktionary:lexicon|lexicon]] &quot;CRT&quot; usually refers to the &quot;picture tube&quot; in a CRT [[television]]. With the introduction of the [[personal computer]] in the early 1980s, &quot;cathode ray tube&quot; (quickly replaced by the [[acronym]] &quot;CRT&quot;) became the word used for the display, which looked like a small [[television]]. It is only one of many types of cathode ray tubes. Other CRTs include the tubes used in [[television]], [[oscilloscopes]], or [[radar]] displays. The camera pickup tubes described in this article are also CRTs, but they display no image, and are not kinescopes.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRT_CEST&quot;&gt;&quot;Cathode-ray tube&quot;, ''McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology'', Third Ed., Sybil P. Parker, ed., McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1992, pp. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early research==
In June 1908, the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published a letter in which [[Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton]], fellow of the [[Royal Society]] ([[UK]]), discussed how a fully electronic television system could be realized by using [[cathode ray tubes]] (or &quot;Braun&quot; tubes, after its inventor, [[Karl Braun]]) as both imaging and display devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swinton_DEV1&quot;&gt;

=== Operation ===
The [[optics|optical]] system of the image dissector focuses an image onto a photocathode mounted inside a high vacuum. As light strikes the photocathode, electrons are emitted in proportion to the intensity of the light (see [[photoelectric effect]]). The entire electron image is deflected and a scanning aperture permits only those electrons emanating from a very small area of the photocathode to be captured by the detector at any given time. The output from the detector is an electric current whose magnitude is a measure of the brightness of the corresponding area of the image. The electron image is [[Frequency|periodically]] deflected horizontally and vertically (&quot;[[raster scan]]ning&quot;) such that the entire image is read by the detector many times per second, producing an electrical signal that can be conveyed to a [[Video monitor|display device]], such as a CRT monitor, to reproduce the image.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horowitz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keith&amp;Tsatsulin&quot;/&gt;

The image dissector has no &quot;[[Capacitance|charge storage]]&quot; characteristic; the vast majority of electrons emitted by the photocathode are excluded by the scanning aperture,&lt;ref name=&quot;Webb&quot;/&gt; and thus wasted rather than being stored on a photo-sensitive target, as in the iconoscope or image orthicon (see below), which largely accounts for its low light sensitivity.

== Iconoscope ==
[[Image:Zworykin and iconoscope.jpg|thumb|Zworykin holding iconoscope tube]]
{{main|Iconoscope}}
An iconoscope is a camera tube that projects an image on a special &quot;[[Capacitance|charge storage]]&quot; plate containing a mosaic of electrically isolated photosensitive granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, somewhat analogous to the [[human eye]]'s [[retina]] and its arrangement of [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]]. Each photosensitive granule constitutes a tiny capacitor that accumulates and stores electrical charge in response to the light striking it. An [[electron beam]] periodically sweeps across the plate, effectively scanning the stored image and discharging each capacitor in turn such that the electrical output from each capacitor is proportional to the average intensity of the light striking it between each discharge event.&lt;ref name=&quot;US2158259&quot;&gt;

The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or &quot;camera&quot; tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by the Hungarian engineer [[Kálmán Tihanyi]] in the beginning of 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEC_Tihanyi&quot;&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/cgi-bin/tl_to_htm.pl?section=person&amp;item=75 &quot;Kálmán Tihanyi (1897–1947)&quot;, ''IEC Techline''], International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), 2009-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges (&quot;photoelectrons&quot;) within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. The device was first described in a patent application he filed in [[Hungary]] in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed &quot;Radioskop&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radioskop&quot;&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-4/kalman-tihanyis-1926-patent-application-radioskop/ &quot;Kálmán Tihanyi's 1926 Patent Application 'Radioskop'&quot;], ''Memory of the World'', United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), 2005, retrieved 2009-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt; After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application,&lt;ref name=&quot;IEC_Tihanyi&quot;/&gt; Tihanyi's patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930,&lt;ref name=&quot;abstract1928&quot;&gt;[http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=EPODOC&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_V3&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19301111&amp;CC=GB&amp;NR=313456A&amp;KC=A Tihanyi, Koloman, ''Improvements in television apparatus''].

[[Zworykin]] presented in 1923 his project for a totally electronic television system to the general manager of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]]. In July 1925, Zworykin submitted a patent application titled ''Television System'' that included a charge storage plate constructed of a thin layer of isolating material (aluminum oxide) sandwiched between a screen (300 mesh) and a colloidal deposit of photoelectric material (potassium hydride) consisting of isolated globules.&lt;ref name=&quot;US1691324&quot;&gt;

This is because [[secondary electrons]] released from the mosaic of the charge storage plate when the scanning beam sweeps across it may be attracted back to the positively charged mosaic, thus neutralizing many of the stored charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;&gt;

The new video camera tube developed by Lubszynski, Rodda and McGee in 1934 was dubbed &quot;the super-Emitron&quot;. This tube is a combination of the image dissector and the Emitron. It has an efficient [[photocathode]] that transforms the scene light into an electron image; the latter is then accelerated towards a target specially prepared for the emission of [[secondary electrons]]. Each individual electron from the electron image produces several secondary electrons after reaching the target, so that an amplification effect is produced. The target is constructed of a mosaic of electrically isolated metallic granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, so that the positive charge resulting from the [[secondary emission]] is stored in the granules. Finally, an electron beam periodically sweeps across the target, effectively scanning the stored image, discharging each granule, and producing an electronic signal like in the iconoscope.&lt;ref name=&quot;GB442666&quot;&gt;

This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron, but the target is constructed of a thin layer of isolating material placed on top of a conductive base, the mosaic of metallic granules is missing. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the [[patent war]] between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their ''Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher'' (''Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television'') in Germany in 1925,&lt;ref name=&quot;DE450187&quot;/&gt; two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;US1773980&quot;/&gt;

===Operation===
The super-Emitron is a combination of the image dissector and the Emitron. The scene image is projected onto an efficient continuous-film semitransparent [[photocathode]] that transforms the scene light into a light-emitted electron image, the latter is then accelerated (and [[Video camera tube#Magnetic focusing in typical camera tubes|focused]]) via electromagnetic fields towards a target specially prepared for the emission of [[secondary electrons]]. Each individual electron from the electron image produces several secondary electrons after reaching the target, so that an amplification effect is produced, and the resulting positive charge is proportional to the integrated intensity of the scene light. The target is constructed of a mosaic of electrically isolated metallic granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, so that the positive charge resulting from the [[secondary emission]] is stored in the capacitor formed by the metallic granule and the common plate. Finally, an electron beam periodically sweeps across the target, effectively scanning the stored image and discharging each capacitor in turn such that the electrical output from each capacitor is proportional to the average intensity of the scene light between each discharge event (as in the iconoscope).&lt;ref name=&quot;GB442666&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GB455123&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GB475928&quot;/&gt;

The image iconoscope is essentially identical to the super-Emitron, but the target is constructed of a thin layer of isolating material placed on top of a conductive base, the mosaic of metallic granules is missing. Therefore, secondary electrons are emitted from the surface of the isolating material when the electron image reaches the target, and the resulting positive charges are stored directly onto the surface of the isolated material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vries&quot;/&gt;

==Orthicon and CPS Emitron==
The original iconoscope was very noisy&lt;ref name=&quot;Winstor-media&quot;/&gt; due to the secondary electrons released from the photoelectric mosaic of the charge storage plate when the scanning beam swept it across.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;/&gt; An obvious solution was to scan the mosaic with an electron beam, which velocity and energy were so low in a neighborhood of the plate, that no secondary electrons were emitted at all. That is, an image is projected onto the photoelectric mosaic of a charge storage plate, so that positive charges are produced and stored there due to [[Photoelectric effect|photo-emission]] and [[capacitance]], respectively. These stored charges are then &quot;gently&quot; discharged by a ''low-velocity electron scanning beam'', preventing the emission of secondary electrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns-Blumlein&quot;&gt;

''Low-velocity scanning beam'' tubes have several advantages; there are low levels of spurious signals and high efficiency of conversion of light into signal, so that the signal output is maximum. However, there are serious problems as well, because the electron beam &quot;spreads&quot; and accelerates in a direction parallel to the target when it scans the image's borders and corners, so that it produces secondary electrons and one gets an image that is well focused in the center but blurry in the borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rose-Iams&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee-review-television&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Lubszynski and the [[EMI]] team were the first engineers in transmitting a clear and well focused image with such a tube.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abramson-Zworykin&quot;/&gt; Another improvement is the use of a semitransparent charge storage plate. The scene image is then projected onto the back side of the plate, while the ''low-velocity electron beam'' scans the photoelectric mosaic at the front side. This configurations allows the use of a straight camera tube, because the scene to be transmitted, the charge storage plate, and the electron gun can be aligned one after the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webb3&quot;/&gt;

The first fully functional ''low-velocity scanning beam'' tube, the CPS Emitron, was invented and demonstrated by the [[EMI]] team under the supervision of [[Isaac Shoenberg]]. In 1934, the EMI engineers Blumlein and McGee filed for patents for ''television transmitting systems'' where a charge storage plate was shielded by a pair of special [[Control grid|grids]], a negative (or slightly positive) grid lay very close to the plate, and a positive one was placed further away.&lt;ref name=&quot;GB446661&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GB446664&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;US2182578&quot;/&gt; The velocity and energy of the electrons in the scanning beam were reduced to zero by the decelerating electric field generated by this pair of grids, and so a ''low-velocity scanning beam'' tube was obtained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns-Blumlein&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGee-Wilcock&quot;&gt;

[[File:Image-orthicon-tube.png|thumb|alt=A 1970s-era RCA Radiotron Image Orthicon TV Camera Tube|A 1970s-era RCA Radiotron Image Orthicon TV Camera Tube]]

The image orthicon, (sometimes abbreviated IO) was common in American broadcasting from 1946 until 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=JMTnTBmt7F0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Abramson,+Albert,+The+History+of+Television,+1942+to+2000#v=onepage&amp;q=1968&amp;f=false Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000''], McFarland, 2003, p. 124. ISBN 0-7864-1220-8.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of the [[Video camera tube#Image dissector|image dissector]] and the orthicon technologies, it replaced the [[Video camera tube#The iconoscope|iconoscope]] in the USA, which required a great deal of [[light]] to work adequately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Television|url=http://encarta.msn.com|work=Microsoft® Encarta® Online Encyclopedia 2000|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Staff|year=1997–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image orthicon tube was developed at RCA by Albert Rose, Paul K. Weimer, and Harold B. Law. It represented a considerable advance in the television field, and after further development work, RCA created original models between 1939 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=JMTnTBmt7F0C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Abramson,+Albert,+The+History+of+Television,+1942+to+2000+orthicon#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000''], McFarland, 2003, pp. 7–8. ISBN 0-7864-1220-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Defense Research Committee]] entered into a contract with RCA where the NDRC paid for its further development. Upon RCA's development of the more sensitive image orthicon tube in 1943, RCA entered into a production contract with the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], the first tubes being delivered in January 1944.&lt;ref&gt;''Remington Rand Inc., v. U.S.'', 
120 F. Supp. 912, 913 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; RCA began production of image orthicons for civilian use in the second quarter of 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;AbramsonP18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aade.com/tubepedia/1collection/tubepedia1.htm aade.com] RCA 2P23, One of the earliest image orthicons&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Video camera tube#The iconoscope|iconoscope]] and the intermediate orthicon used capacitance between a multitude of small but discrete light sensitive collectors and an isolated signal plate for reading video information, the image orthicon employed direct charge readings from a continuous ''electronically charged'' collector. The resultant signal was immune to most extraneous signal &quot;crosstalk&quot; from other parts of the target, and could yield extremely detailed images. For instance, image orthicon cameras were used for capturing Apollo/Saturn rockets nearing orbit after the networks had phased them out, as only they could provide sufficient detail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/space/apollo.html The University of Alabama] Telescopic Tracking of the Apollo Lunar Missions&lt;/ref&gt;

An image orthicon camera can take television pictures by candlelight because of the more ordered light-sensitive area and the presence of an electron multiplier at the base of the tube, which operated as a high-efficiency amplifier. It also has a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] light sensitivity curve similar to the [[human eye]]. However, it tends to [[lens flare|flare]] in bright light, causing a dark halo to be seen around the object; this anomaly is referred to as &quot;[[blooming (CCD)|blooming]]&quot; in the broadcast industry when image orthicon tubes were in operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/435563.pdf dtic.mil] Westinghouse Non-blooming Image Orthicon.&lt;/ref&gt; Image orthicons were used extensively in the early color television cameras, where their increased sensitivity was essential to overcome their very inefficient optical system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0621683 oai.dtic.mil] Non-blooming Image Orthicon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/435563.pdf dtic.mil] Westinghouse Non-blooming Image Orthicon.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation===
An image orthicon consists of three parts: a [[photocathode]] with an image store (&quot;''target''&quot;), a scanner that reads this image (an [[electron gun]]), and a multistage electron multiplier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troysvintagevideo.741.com/ioproject.html roysvintagevideo.741.com] 3&quot; image orthicon camera project&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image store, light falls upon the photocathode which is a photosensitive plate at a very negative potential (approx. -600&amp;nbsp;V), and is converted into an electron image (a principle borrowed from the image dissector). This electron ''rain'' is then accelerated towards the target (a very thin glass plate acting as a semi-isolator) at ground potential (0&amp;nbsp;V), and passes through a very fine wire mesh (near 200 wires per cm), very near (a few hundredths of cm) and parallel to the target, acting as a [[screen grid]] at a slightly positive voltage (approx +2&amp;nbsp;V). Once the image electrons reach the target, they cause a &quot;splash&quot; of electrons by the effect of [[secondary emission]]. On average, each image electron ejects several &quot;splash&quot; electrons (thus adding amplification by secondary emission), and these excess electrons are soaked up by the positive mesh effectively removing electrons from the target and causing a positive charge on it in relation to the incident light in the photocathode. The result is an image painted in positive charge, with the brightest portions having the largest positive charge.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/IMAGE_ORTHICON.html acmi.net.au] The Image Orthicon (Television Camera) Tube c. 1940 - 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

A sharply focused beam of electrons (a cathode ray) is generated by the [[electron gun]] at ground potential and accelerated by the anode (the first [[dynode]] of the [[electron multiplier]]) around the gun at a high positive voltage (approx. +1500&amp;nbsp;V). Once it exits the electron gun, its inertia makes the beam move away from the dynode towards the back side of the target. At this point the electrons lose speed and get deflected by the horizontal and vertical deflection coils, effectively scanning the target. Thanks to the [[Video camera tube#Magnetic focusing in typical camera tubes|axial magnetic field of the focusing coil]], this deflection is not in a straight line, thus when the electrons reach the target they do so perpendicularly avoiding a sideways component. The target is nearly at ground potential with a small positive charge, thus when the electrons reach the target at low speed they are absorbed without ejecting more electrons. This adds negative charge to the positive charge until the region being scanned reaches some threshold negative charge, at which point the scanning electrons are reflected by the negative potential rather than absorbed (in this process the target recovers the electrons needed for the next scan). These reflected electrons return down the cathode ray tube toward the first dynode of the electron multiplier surrounding the electron gun which is at high potential. The number of reflected electrons is a linear measure of the target's original positive charge, which, in turn, is a measure of brightness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fazano.pro.br/ing/indi84.html fazano.pro.br] The Image Converter&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark halo===
The mysterious dark &quot;orthicon halo&quot; around bright objects in an IO-captured image is based on the fact that the IO relies on the emission of photoelectrons, but very bright illumination can produce more of them locally than the device can successfully deal with. At a very bright point on a captured image, a great preponderance of electrons is ejected from the photosensitive plate. So many may be ejected that the corresponding point on the collection mesh can no longer ''soak them up'', and thus they fall back to nearby spots on the target instead, much as water splashes in a ring when a rock is thrown into it. Since the resultant ''splashed'' electrons do not contain sufficient energy to eject further electrons where they land, they will instead neutralize any positive charge that has been built-up in that region. Since darker images produce less positive charge on the target, the excess electrons deposited by the splash will be read as a ''dark'' region by the scanning electron beam.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

This effect was actually &quot;cultivated&quot; by tube manufacturers to a certain extent, as a [[Unsharp masking|small, carefully controlled amount of the dark halo]] has the effect of &quot;crispening&quot; the visual image due to the [[contrast effect]]. (That is, giving the illusion of being more sharply focused than it actually is). The later Vidicon tube and its descendants (see below) do not exhibit this effect, and so could not be used for broadcast purposes until special &quot;detail correction&quot; circuitry could be developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morpheustechnology.com/ebooks/Multimedia/04%20Imaging.htm#_4.5.1_Camera_Tubes morpheustechnology.com] Morpheus Technology 4.5.1 Camera Tubes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vidicon==
A vidicon tube is a video camera tube design in which the target material is a photoconductor.  The Vidicon was developed in the 1950s at RCA by P. K. Weimer, S. V. Forgue and R. R. Goodrich as a simple alternative to the structurally and electrically complex Image Orthicon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  While the initial photoconductor used was selenium, other targets–including silicon diode arrays–have been used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[File:Vidicon.png|thumb|400px|Schematic of vidicon tube.]]
The vidicon is a storage-type camera tube in which a charge-density pattern is formed by the imaged scene radiation on a [[photoconductor|photoconductive]] surface which is then scanned by a beam of low-velocity [[electron]]s. The fluctuating voltage coupled out to a video [[amplifier]] can be used to reproduce the scene being imaged. The electrical charge produced by an image will remain in the face plate until it is scanned or until the charge dissipates. [[Pyroelectric]] [[photocathode]]s can be used to produce a vidicon sensitive over a broad portion of the [[infrared]] spectrum.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Prior to the design and construction of the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] probe to [[Jupiter]] in the late 1970s to early 1980s, [[NASA]] used Vidicon cameras on most of their unmanned deep space probes equipped with the remote sensing ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spacecraft Imaging: III. First Voyage into the PDS|url=http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/03-pds_voyager.ppt|publisher=The Planetary Society|accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vidicon tubes were also used aboard the first two [[Landsat]] earth imaging satellites launched in 1972, as part of each spacecraft's Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) imaging system.

Vidicon tubes were popular in 1970's and 1980's after which they were rendered obsolete by CCD and CMOS sensors.

===Plumbicon===
Plumbicon is a registered trademark of [[Philips]] for its [[Lead(II) oxide]] (PbO) target vidicons. Used frequently in broadcast camera applications, these tubes have low output, but a high [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. They had excellent resolution compared to Image Orthicons, but lacked the artificially sharp edges of IO tubes, which caused some of the viewing audience to perceive them as softer. CBS Labs invented the first outboard edge enhancement circuits to sharpen the edges of Plumbicon generated images.&lt;ref name=&quot;nimaging_history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Narragansett Imaging|url=http://www.nimaging.com/about/history.html|work=Narragansett Imaging|publisher=Narragansett Imaging|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Staff|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nimaging_index&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Camera Tubes|url=http://www.nimaging.com/products/tubes/index.html|work=Narragansett Imaging|publisher=Narragansett Imaging|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Staff|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nimaging_plumbicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Plumbicon Broadcast Tubes|url=http://www.nimaging.com/products/tubes/plumbicon_broadcast.html|work=Narragansett Imaging|publisher=Narragansett Imaging|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Staff|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plumbicon.jpg|thumb|400px|Schematic of a Plumbicon tube. (This image is schematic, not to scale; a Plumbicon has the same shape as a vidicon.)]]
Compared to Saticons, Plumbicons had much higher resistance to burn in, and comet and trailing artifacts from bright lights in the shot. Saticons though, usually had slightly higher resolution. After 1980, and the introduction of the diode gun plumbicon tube, the resolution of both types was so high, compared to the maximum limits of the broadcasting standard, that the Saticon's resolution advantage became moot. While broadcast cameras migrated to solid state Charged Coupled Devices, plumbicon tubes remain a staple imaging device in the medical field.&lt;ref name=&quot;nimaging_history&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nimaging_index&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nimaging_plumbicon&quot;/&gt;

Narragansett Imaging is the only company now making Plumbicons, and it does so from the factories Philips built for that purpose in [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island, USA]]. While still a part of the Philips empire, the company purchased EEV's (English Electric Valve) lead oxide camera tube business, and gained a monopoly in lead oxide tube production.&lt;ref name=&quot;nimaging_history&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nimaging_index&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nimaging_plumbicon&quot;/&gt;

===Saticon===
Saticon is a registered trademark of [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] also produced by [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] and [[Sony]]. It was developed in a joint effort by Hitachi and [[NHK]] (Japan Broadcasting Corporation). Its surface consists of Selenium with trace amounts of Arsenic and Tellurium added (SeAsTe) to make the signal more stable. SAT in the name is derived from (SeAsTe). {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Pasecon===
Pasecon is a registered trademark of [[Heimann]]. Its surface consists of [[Cadmium selenide]] (CdSe).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Newvicon===
Newvicon is a registered trademark of [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]]. The Newvicon tubes were characterized by high light sensitivity. Its surface consists of a combination of [[Zinc selenide]] (ZnSe) and [[Cadmium zinc telluride|Zinc Cadmium Telluride]] (ZnCdTe).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Trinicon===
Trinicon is a registered trademark of [[Sony]]. It uses a vertically striped RGB color filter over the faceplate of an otherwise standard vidicon imaging tube to segment the scan into corresponding red, green and blue segments. Only one tube was used in the camera, instead of a tube for each color, as was standard for color cameras used in television broadcasting. It is used mostly in low-end consumer cameras and camcorders, though Sony also used it in some moderate cost professional cameras in the 1980s, such as the DXC-1800 and BVP-1 models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinicon&quot;&gt;[http://www.labguysworld.com/Sony_DXC-1600.htm &quot;Sony DXC-1600&quot;], LabGuysWorld.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the idea of using color stripe filters over the target was not new, the Trinicon was the only tube to use the primary RGB colors.  This necessitated an additional electrode buried in the target to detect where the scanning electron beam was relative to the stripe filter.  Previous color stripe systems had used colors where the color circuitry was able to separate the colors purely from the relative amplitudes of the signals.  As a result the Trinicon featured a larger dynamic range of operation.

===Light biasing===
All the vidicon type tubes except the vidicon itself were able to use a light biasing technique to improve the sensitivity and contrast.  The photosensitive target in these tubes suffered from the limitation that the light level had to rise to a particular level before any video output resulted.  Light biasing was a method whereby the photosensitive target was illuminated from a light source just enough that no appreciable output was obtained, but such that a slight increase in light level from the scene was enough to provide discernible output.  The light came from either an illuminator mounted around the target, or in more professional cameras from a light source on the base of the tube and guided to the target by light piping.  The technique would not work with the baseline vidicon tube because it suffered from the limitation that as the target was fundamentally an insulator, the constant low light level built up a charge which would manifest itself as a form of 'fogging'.  The other types had semiconducting targets which did not have this problem.

== Color cameras ==
Early color cameras used the obvious technique of using separate red, green and blue image tubes in conjunction with a [[dichroic prism|color separator]], a technique still in use with [[3CCD]] solid state cameras today.  It was also possible to construct a color camera that used a single image tube.  One technique has already been described (Trinicon above).  A more common technique and a simpler one from the tube construction standpoint was to overlay the photosensitive target with a color striped filter having a fine pattern of vertical stripes of green, cyan and clear filters (i.e. Green; Green+Blue &amp; Green+Blue+Red) repeating across the target.  The advantage of this arrangement was that for virtually every color, the video level of the green component was always less than the cyan, and similarly the cyan was always less than the white.  Thus the contributing images could be separated without any reference electrodes in the tube.  If the three levels were the same, then that part of the scene was green.  This method suffered from the disadvantage that the light levels under the three filters were almost certain to be different, with the green filter passing not more than one third of the available light.

Variations on this scheme exist, the principal one being to use two filters with color stripes overlaid such that the colors form vertically oriented lozenge shapes overlaying the target.  The method of extracting the color is similar however.

=== Field-sequential color system ===
During the 1930s and 1940s, [[Field-sequential color system]]s were developed which used synchronized motor-driven color-filter disks at the camera's image tube and at the television receiver. Each disk consisted of red, blue, and green transparent color filters. In the camera, the disk was in the optical path, and in the receiver, it was in front of the CRT. Disk rotation was synchronized with vertical scanning so that each vertical scan in sequence was for a different primary color.  This method allowed regular black-and-white image tubes and CRTs to generate and display color images.  A field-sequential system developed by [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] for [[CBS]] was demonstrated to the press on September 4, 1940,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Color Television Achieves Realism&quot;, ''New York Times'', Sept. 5, 1940, p. 18. A color 16&amp;nbsp;mm film was shown; live pick-ups were first demonstrated to the press in 1941. &quot;Columbia Broadcasting Exhibits Color Television&quot;, ''Wall Street Journal'', Jan. 10, 1941, p. 4. &quot;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/cbs_1941_color_article.html CBS Makes Live Pick-up in Color Television]&quot;, ''Radio &amp; Television'', April 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; and was first shown to the general public on January 12, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Washington Chosen for First Color Showing; From Ages 4 to 90, Audience Amazed&quot;, ''The Washington Post'', Jan. 13, 1950, p.

== Magnetic focusing in typical camera tubes ==
The phenomenon known as ''magnetic focusing'' was discovered by A. A. Campbell-Swinton in 1896,
he found that a longitudinal magnetic field generated by an axial coil can focus an electron beam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swinton_ESMF&quot;&gt;

Diagrams in this article show that the focus coil surrounds the camera tube; it is much longer than the focus coils for earlier TV CRTs. Camera-tube focus coils, by themselves, have essentially parallel lines of force, very different from the localized semi-toroidal magnetic field geometry inside a TV receiver CRT focus coil. The latter is essentially a magnetic lens; it focuses the &quot;crossover&quot; (between the CRT's cathode and G1 electrode, where the electrons pinch together and diverge again) onto the screen.

The electron optics of camera tubes differ considerably. Electrons inside these long focus coils take helical paths as they travel along the length of the tube. The center (think local axis) of one of those helices is like a line of force of the magnetic field. While the electrons are traveling, the helices essentially don't matter. Assuming that they start from a point, the electrons will focus to a point again at a distance determined by the strength of the field. Focusing a tube with this kind of coil is simply a matter of trimming the coil's current. In effect, the electrons travel along the lines of force, although helically, in detail.

These focus coils are essentially as long as the tubes themselves, and surround the deflection yoke (coils). Deflection fields bend the lines of force (with negligible defocusing), and the electrons follow the lines of force.

In a conventional magnetically deflected CRT, such as in a TV receiver or computer monitor, basically the vertical deflection coils are equivalent to coils wound around an horizontal axis. That axis is perpendicular to the neck of the tube; lines of force are basically horizontal. (In detail, coils in a deflection yoke extend some distance beyond the neck of the tube, and lie close to the flare of the bulb; they have a truly distinctive appearance.)

In a magnetically focused camera tube (there are electrostatically focused vidicons), the vertical deflection coils are above and below the tube, instead of being on both sides of it. One might say that this sort of deflection starts to create S-bends in the lines of force, but doesn't become anywhere near to that extreme.

==Size==
The size of video camera tubes is simply the overall outside diameter of the glass envelope.  This differs from the size of the sensitive area of the target which is typically two thirds of the size of the overall diameter.  Tube sizes are always expressed in inches for historical reasons.  A one inch camera tube has a sensitive area of approximately two thirds of an inch on the diagonal or about 16&amp;nbsp;mm.

Although the video camera tube is now technologically obsolete, the size of solid state sensors is still expressed as the equivalent size of a camera tube.  For this purpose a new term was coined and it is known as the [[optical format]].  The optical format is approximately the true diagonal of the sensor multiplied by 3/2. &lt;!-- To say divided by 16 to give a mm result from inches although approximately valid is not technically correct.  It is a bad idea to mix units.---&gt;  The result is expressed in inches and is usually (though not always) rounded to a convenient fraction - hence the approximation. For instance, a 6.4x4.8&amp;nbsp;mm sensor has a diagonal of 8.0&amp;nbsp;mm and therefore an optical format of 8.0*3/2=12&amp;nbsp;mm which is rounded to the convenient imperial fraction of 1/2 inch. The parameter is also the source of the &quot;Four Thirds&quot; in the [[Four Thirds system]] and its [[Micro Four Thirds system|Micro Four Thirds]] extension—the imaging area of the sensor in these cameras is approximately that of a 4/3 inch video camera tube at appromimately {{convert|22|mm|inch}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making (some) sense out of sensor sizes|url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/2002/10/7/sensorsizes|work=Digital Photography Review|publisher=Digital Photography Review|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Staff|date=7 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the optical format size bears no relationship to any physical parameter of the sensor, its use means that a lens that would have been used with (say) a four thirds inch camera tube will give roughly the same angle of view when used with a solid state sensor with an optical format of four thirds inch.

Modern [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] and [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS-based sensors]] offer many advantages over their tube counterparts.  These include a lack of image lag, high overall picture quality, high light sensitivity and dynamic range, a better signal-to-noise ratio and significantly higher reliability and ruggedness.  Other advantages include the elimination of the respective high and low voltage power supplies required for the electron beam and [[Vacuum tube|heater filament]], elimination of the drive circuitry for the focusing coils, no warm-up time and a significantly lower overall power consumption.  Despite these advantages, acceptance and incorporation of solid-state sensors into television and video cameras was not immediate.  One reason was that early sensors were not able to best tubes in terms of resolution or performance and initially were mostly relegated to consumer-grade video recording equipment.

The second reason is that like all mature technologies, video tubes had progressed to a high standard of quality and were &quot;standard issue&quot; equipment to networks and production entities.  Those entities had a substantial investment in not only tube cameras, but also in the ancillary equipment needed to correctly process tube-derived video.  A switchover to solid-state image sensors would render much of that equipment (and the investments behind it) obsolete and would require new equipment optimized to work well with solid-state sensors, just as the old equipment was optimized for tube-sourced video.  It's difficult to justify junking a perfectly good camera along with corresponding rack of outboard gear, especially if one is the accountant.

Attrition in old gear and major improvements in solid-state image sensors eventually won the day, and today it would be difficult to find a tube-type video camera in use for anything other than a specialized purpose.

'''Thermionic emission''' is the thermally induced flow of [[charge carriers]] from a surface or over a potential-energy barrier. This occurs because the thermal energy given to the carrier overcomes the [[work function]] of the material. The charge carriers can be [[electron]]s or [[ion]]s, and in older literature are sometimes referred to as &quot;thermions&quot;. After emission, a charge that is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the total charge emitted is initially left behind in the emitting region. But if the emitter is connected to a battery, the charge left behind is neutralized by charge supplied by the battery as the emitted charge carriers move away from the emitter, and finally the emitter will be in the same state as it was before emission.

The classical example of thermionic emission is the emission of electrons from a [[hot cathode]] into a vacuum (also known as '''thermal electron emission''' or the '''Edison effect''') in a [[vacuum tube]]. The hot cathode can be a metal filament, a coated metal filament, or a separate structure of metal or carbides or borides of transition metals. Vacuum emission from metals tends to become significant only for temperatures over {{convert|1000|K|C F}}. The science dealing with this phenomenon has been known as &quot;thermionics&quot;, but this name seems to be gradually falling into disuse. {{According to whom|date=November 2013}}

The term &quot;thermionic emission&quot; is now also used to refer to any thermally-excited charge emission process, even when the charge is emitted from one [[solid-state physics|solid-state]] region into another. This process is crucially important in the operation of a variety of electronic devices and can be used for [[electricity generation]] (such as [[thermionic converter]]s and [[electrodynamic tether]]s) or cooling. The magnitude of the charge flow increases dramatically with increasing temperature.

Because the [[electron]] was not identified as a separate physical particle until the 1897 work of [[J. J. Thomson]], the word &quot;electron&quot; was not used when discussing experiments that took place before this date.

The phenomenon was initially reported in 1873 by [[Frederick Guthrie]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;See:

He also found that this did not happen if the sphere had a positive charge.&lt;ref&gt;

The effect was rediscovered by [[Thomas Edison]] on February 13, 1880, while trying to discover the reason for breakage of lamp filaments and uneven blackening (darkest near the positive terminal of the filament) of the bulbs in his [[incandescent lamp]]s.

Edison built several experimental lamp bulbs with an extra wire, metal plate, or foil inside the bulb that was separate from the filament and thus could serve as an electrode. He connected a [[galvanometer]], a device used to measure current (the flow of charge), to the output of the extra metal electrode. If the foil was put at a negative potential relative to the filament, there was no measurable current between the filament and the foil. When the foil was raised to a positive potential relative to the filament, there could be a significant current between the filament through the vacuum to the foil if the filament was heated sufficiently (by its own external power source).

We now know that the filament was emitting electrons, which were attracted to a positively charged foil, but not a negatively charged one.  This one-way current was called the ''Edison effect'' (although the term is occasionally used to refer to thermionic emission itself). He found that the current emitted by the hot filament increased rapidly with increasing voltage, and filed a patent application for a voltage-regulating device using the effect on November 15, 1883 (U.S. patent 307,031,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|inventor-first=Thomas A. |inventor-last=Edison |inventorlink1=Thomas Edison |title=Electrical indicator |country-code=US |patent-number=307031 |publication-date=November 15, 1883 |issue-date=October 21, 1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first US patent for an electronic device). He found that sufficient current would pass through the device to operate a telegraph sounder. This was exhibited at the [[International Electrical Exposition]] in Philadelphia in September 1884.

Fleming went on to develop the two-element [[vacuum tube]] known as the [[diode]], which he patented on November 16, 1904.&lt;ref&gt;See:

The thermionic diode can also be configured as a device that converts a heat difference to electric power directly without moving parts (a [[thermionic converter]], a type of [[heat engine]]).

==Richardson's Law== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] --&gt;

Following J. J. Thomson's identification of the electron in 1897, the British physicist [[Owen Willans Richardson]] began work on the topic that he later called &quot;thermionic emission&quot;. He received a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1928 &quot;for his work on the thermionic phenomenon and especially for the discovery of the law named after him&quot;.

From [[band theory]], there are one or two electrons per [[atom]] in a solid that are free to move from atom to atom. This is sometimes collectively referred to as a &quot;sea of electrons&quot;. Their velocities follow a statistical distribution, rather than being uniform, and occasionally an electron will have enough velocity to exit the metal without being pulled back in. The minimum amount of energy needed for an electron to leave a surface is called the [[work function]]. The work function is characteristic of the material and for most metals is on the order of several [[electronvolt]]s. Thermionic currents can be increased by decreasing the work function. This often-desired goal can be achieved by applying various oxide coatings to the wire.

In 1901 [[Owen Willans Richardson|Richardson]] published the results of his experiments: the current from a heated wire seemed to depend exponentially on the temperature of the wire with a mathematical form similar to the [[Arrhenius equation]].&lt;ref&gt;O. W. Richardson (1901) [http://books.google.com/books?id=QAUPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA286#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;On the negative radiation from hot platinum,&quot;] ''Philosophical of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'', '''11''' : 286-295.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he proposed that the emission law should have the mathematical form &lt;ref name=&quot;Crowell&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J = A_{\mathrm{G}} T^2 \mathrm{e}^{-W \over k T}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' is the emission [[current density]], ''T'' is the temperature of the metal, ''W'' is the [[work function]] of the metal, ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is a parameter discussed next.

In the period 1911 to 1930, as physical understanding of the behaviour of electrons in metals increased, various theoretical expressions (based on different physical assumptions) were put forwards for ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, by Richardson, [[Saul Dushman]], [[Ralph H. Fowler]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] and [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim]]. Over 60 years later, there is still no consensus amongst interested theoreticians as to what is the exact expression of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, but there is agreement that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; must be written in the form
:&lt;math&gt; A_{\mathrm{G}} = \; \lambda_{\mathrm{R}} A_0 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is a material-specific correction factor that is typically of order 0.5, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a universal constant given by &lt;ref name=&quot;Crowell&quot;&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 = {4 \pi m k^2 e \over h^3} = 1.20173 \times 10^6\,\mathrm{A\,m^{-2}\,K^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' and &amp;minus;''e'' are the mass and charge of an electron, and ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]].

In fact, by about 1930 there was agreement that, due to the wave-like nature of electrons, some proportion ''r''&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt; of the outgoing electrons would be reflected as they reached the emitter surface, so the emission current density would be reduced, and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; would have the value (1-''r''&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt;). Thus, one sometimes sees the thermionic emission equation written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;J = (1-r_{\mathrm{av}}) A_0 T^2 \mathrm{e}^{-W \over k T}&lt;/math&gt;.

However, a modern theoretical treatment by Modinos assumes that the [[band theory|band-structure]] of the emitting material must also be taken into account. This would introduce a second correction factor ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; into ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, giving &lt;math&gt; A_{\mathrm{G}} = \lambda_{\mathrm{B}} (1-r_{\mathrm{av}}) A_0 &lt;/math&gt;. Experimental values for the &quot;generalized&quot; coefficient ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; are generally of the order of magnitude of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, but do differ significantly as between different emitting materials, and can differ as between different [[crystallographic face]]s of the same material. At least qualitatively, these experimental differences can be explained as due to differences in the value of ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.

Considerable confusion exists in the literature of this area because: (1) many sources do not distinguish between ''A''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, but just use the symbol ''A'' (and sometimes the name &quot;Richardson constant&quot;) indiscriminately; (2) equations with and without the correction factor here denoted by ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; are both given the same name; and (3) a variety of names exist for these equations, including &quot;Richardson equation&quot;, &quot;Dushman's equation&quot;, &quot;Richardson–Dushman equation&quot; and &quot;Richardson–Laue–Dushman equation&quot;. In the literature, the elementary equation is sometimes given in circumstances where the generalized equation would be more appropriate, and this in itself can cause confusion. To avoid misunderstandings, the meaning of any &quot;A-like&quot; symbol should always be explicitly defined in terms of the more fundamental quantities involved.

Because of the exponential function, the current increases rapidly with temperature when ''kT'' is less than ''W''. (For essentially every material, melting occurs well before ''kT'' = ''W''.)

==Schottky emission==
{{sync|Schottky effect|date=March 2013}}
{{Main|Schottky effect}}
In electron emission devices, especially [[electron gun]]s, the thermionic electron emitter will be biased negative relative to its surroundings. This creates an electric field of magnitude ''F'' at the emitter surface. Without the field, the surface barrier seen by an escaping Fermi-level electron has height ''W'' equal to the local work-function. The electric field lowers the surface barrier by an amount Δ''W'', and increases the emission current. This is known as the '''Schottky effect''' (named for [[Walter H. Schottky]]) or field enhanced thermionic emission. It can be modeled by a simple modification of the Richardson equation, by replacing ''W'' by (''W''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;Δ''W''). This gives the equation&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta W = \sqrt{e^3 F \over 4\pi \epsilon_0},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the electric constant (also, formerly, called the [[Permittivity#Vacuum permittivity|vacuum permittivity]]).

Electron emission that takes place in the field-and-temperature-regime where this modified equation applies is often called '''Schottky emission'''. This equation is relatively accurate for electric field strengths lower than about 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; V&amp;nbsp; m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. For electric field strengths higher than 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; V&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, so-called [[Field electron emission|Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling]] begins to contribute significant emission current. In this regime, the combined effects of field-enhanced thermionic and field emission can be modeled by the Murphy-Good equation for thermo-field (T-F) emission.&lt;ref&gt;

==Photon-enhanced thermionic emission==
Photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) is a process developed by scientists at [[Stanford University]] that harnesses both the light and heat of the sun to generate electricity and increases the efficiency of solar power production by more than twice the current levels. The device developed for the process reaches peak efficiency above 200&amp;nbsp;°C, while most silicon [[solar cell]]s become inert after reaching 100&amp;nbsp;°C. Such devices work best in [[parabolic dish]] collectors, which reach temperatures up to 800&amp;nbsp;°C. Although the team used a [[gallium nitride]] semiconductor in its proof-of-concept device, it claims that the use of [[gallium arsenide]] can increase the device's efficiency to 55–60 percent, nearly triple that of existing systems,&lt;ref&gt;

==Thermionic emission from graphene==
Compared with the traditional bulk metal or semiconductor materials, [[graphene]] has many unique and excellent properties, such as atomic layer thickness, linear band structure near Dirac cone, ultrahigh Fermi velocity, etc, making traditional Richardson's law derived for bulk materials invalid for graphene. Researchers from Singapore University of Technology and Design have proposed that there exists a new scaling of thermionic emission from a single-layer graphene which has been verified with an experiment.&lt;ref&gt;

Many [[electric guitar]], [[electric bass]], and keyboard players in several genres also prefer the sound of tube [[instrument amplifier]]s or preamplifiers.

==History==
Before the commercial introduction of [[transistor]]s in the 1950s, electronic amplifiers used vacuum tubes (known in Great Britain as &quot;valves&quot;). By the 1960s, [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] (transistorized) amplification had become more common because of its smaller size, lighter weight, lower heat production, and improved reliability.  Tube amplifiers have retained a loyal following amongst some audiophiles and musicians. Some tube designs command very high prices, and tube amplifiers have been going through a revival since Chinese and Russian markets have opened to global trade—tube production never went out of vogue in these countries.

==Sound reproduction==
Audiophiles disagree on the relative merits of tube vs solid state amplification. Some prefer the sound produced from tube amplifiers on the grounds that it is more natural and satisfying than the sound from transistor amplifiers. Otherwise this preference or difference is far too generalised or even vague without taking amplifier designs into consideration, and there are many. Certainly these audible differences are due to distortion types: harmonic, distribution, level and many other factors.

Solid state designs can be manufactured without output transformers and are therefore immune to speaker-dependent impedance mismatches and other transformer effects which alter the system spectral response. On the other hand, flat frequency response does not necessarily mean a good sounding amplifier. The loudspeaker itself (regardless of price) will likely produce more non-linearity and uneven frequency response than any other part of the system. Typically, in [[sound reproduction]] systems, accurate reproduction of the sound of the original recording is the goal; distortion and uneven spectral response is to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;The Noisy Audiophile. [http://www.soundstage.com/noisy04.htm &quot;'Noisy' on Tubes vs. Solid State&quot;] in ''SoundStage!'', March 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical instrument amplification==
Some musicians&lt;ref&gt;For example, Robert Walser ''Running with the Devil: power, gender, and madness in heavy metal music'', Wesleyan University Press, 1993 ISBN 0-8195-6260-2 
 pages 43-44 discusses the &quot;tube sound&quot; sought by [[Eddie Van Halen]]&lt;/ref&gt; also prefer the [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]] characteristics of tubes over transistors for electric guitar, bass, and other instrument amplifiers.  In this case, generating deliberate (and sometimes considerable, in the case of electric guitars) audible [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] or overdrive is usually the goal. The term can also be used to describe the sound created by specially-designed transistor amplifiers or [[Digital data|digital]] modeling devices that try to closely emulate the characteristics of the tube sound.

The tube sound is often subjectively described as having a &quot;warmth&quot; and &quot;richness&quot;, but the source of this is by no means agreed on. It may be due to the non-linear clipping that occurs with tube amps, or due to the higher levels of second-order harmonic distortion, common in single-ended designs resulting from the characteristics of the tube interacting with the [[inductance]] of the output transformer.

==Audible differences==
The sound of a tube amplifier is partly a function of the circuit topologies typically used with tubes versus the topologies typically used with transistors, as much as the gain devices themselves. Beyond circuit design, there are other differences such as the differing electronic characteristics of [[triode]], [[tetrode]], and [[pentode]] vacuum tubes, along with their solid-state counterparts such as [[bipolar transistor]], [[FET]], [[MOSFET]], [[IGBT]], etc. These can be further divided into differences among various models of the said device type (e.g. EL34 vs. 6L6 tetrodes). In many cases circuit topologies need to account these differences to either homogenize their widely varying characteristics or to establish a certain operating point required by the device.

The low frequency roll-off can be explained by many tube amplifiers having high output [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] compared to transistor designs, due to the combination of both higher device impedance itself and typically reduced feedback margins (more feedback results in a lower output impedance).

==Harmonic content and distortion==
Triodes (and [[MOSFET]]s) produce a monotonically decaying harmonic distortion spectrum.{{Clarify|date=June 2010|reason=Explain how they differ from other vacuum tubes and transistors, if there is relevance to the article}} Even-order harmonics and odd-order harmonics are both [[natural number]] multiples of the input frequency.

Psychoacoustic phenomena include the effect that high-order harmonics are more offensive than low. Thus, in distortion measurements this should be taken into consideration to weight audible high-order harmonics more than low. The importance of high-order harmonics suggests that distortion should be regarded in terms of the complete series or of the composite wave-form that this series represents. It has been shown that weighting the harmonics by the square of the order correlates well with subjective listening tests. Weighting the distortion wave-form proportionally to the square of the frequency gives a measure of the reciprocal of the radius of curvature of the wave-form, and is therefore related to the sharpness of any corners on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shorter |first=D.

A huge issue is that measurements of objective nature (for example, those indicating magnitude of scientifically quantifiable variables such as current, voltage, power, THD, dB, and so on) fail to address subjective preferences. Especially in case of designing or reviewing instrument amplifiers this is a considerable issue because design goals of such differ widely from design goals of likes of HiFi amplifiers. HiFi design largely concentrates on improving performance of objectively measurable variables while instrument amplifier design largely concentrates on subjective issues, such as &quot;pleasantness&quot; of certain type of tone. Fine examples are cases of distortion or frequency response: HiFi design tries to minimize distortion and focuses on eliminating &quot;offensive&quot; harmonics. It also aims for ideally flat response. Musical instrument amplifier design deliberately introduces distortion and great non-linearities in frequency response. Former &quot;offensiveness&quot; of certain types of harmonics becomes a highly subjective topic, along with preferences towards certain types of frequency responses (whether flat or un-flat).

Push–pull amplifiers use two nominally identical gain devices &quot;back to back&quot;. One consequence of this is that all even-order harmonic products cancel, leaving odd order products to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;A First Course in Electronics, pg 414-416. Anwar A. Khan and Kanchan K. Dey&lt;/ref&gt; A push–pull amplifier is said to have a symmetric ([[even and odd functions|odd symmetry]]) [[transfer characteristic]], and accordingly produces only odd harmonics. It is wortwhile to acknowledge that generally past 5W - 10W output power mark most power amplifiers tend to be of push-pull -type due to said topology's efficiency.

A single-ended amplifier has an asymmetric transfer characteristic, and produces both even ''and'' odd harmonics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ask the doctors&quot;&gt;[http://www.uaudio.com/webzine/2005/october/content/content2.html Ask the Doctors: Tube vs. Solid-State Harmonics]—Universal Audio Webzine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;volume cranked up&quot;&gt;[http://www.trueaudio.com/at_eetjlm.htm Volume cranked up in amp debate]—Electronic Engineering Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tvtiega&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A particularly famous research about &quot;tube sound&quot; compared a selection of single-ended tube microphone preamplifiers to a selection of push-pull transistorized microphone preamplifiers. The difference in harmonic patterns of these two topologies has henceforth been often incorrectly attributed as difference of tube and solid-state devices (or even the amplifier class). Push–pull tube amplifiers can be run in class A, AB, or B. Also, a [[class-B amplifier]] may have crossover distortion that will be typically high order and thus sonically very undesirable indeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meusburger |first=Walter |authorlink1= |title=A Novel Power Amplifier Topology Without Crossover Distortion |url=http://www.moehrenbude.de/Moehre/images2/download/No_Crossoveramp_W.Meusberger.pdf |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-03-18 |type=D.Tech. thesis | date=October 1999 |publisher=Graz University of Technology |location=Graz, Austria |page=27 |chapter=4 Crossover Distortion in Class B |quote=Crossover distortion generates unpleasant high order harmonics with the potential to increase in percentage as signal level falls and is much more objectionable to the listener than distortion resulting from a smoothly curved characteristic, even if they have the same THD. Therefore it is desirable to reduce crossover distortion to a minimum amount.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor is that the distortion content of class-A circuits (SE or PP) typically monotonically reduces as the signal level is reduced, asymptotic to zero during quiet passages of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.passdiy.com/project/articles/audio-distortion-and-feedback |title=Audio, Distortion and Feedback |last=Pass |first=Nelson |authorlink=Nelson Pass |date= |month= |year=2008 |website=PassDiy |at= Harmonic Distortion and Sound  |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=12 October 2013 |quote=The smooth transfer curves of Class A amplifiers have a characteristic which is monotonic, that is to say the distortion goes down as the output declines. |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason class-A amplifiers are especially desired for classical and acoustic music etc. cf. class-B and AB amplifiers, for which the amplitude of the crossover distortion is more or less constant, and thus the distortion ''relative to signal'' in fact increases as the music gets quieter. Class-A amplifiers measure best at low power, class-AB and B amplifiers measure best just below max rated power.

Loudspeakers present a reactive load to an amplifier ([[capacitance]], [[inductance]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]). This impedance may vary in value with signal frequency and amplitude. This variable loading affects the amplifier's performance both because the amplifier has nonzero output impedance (it cannot keep its output voltage perfectly constant when the speaker load varies) and because the phase of the speaker load can change the stability margin of the amplifier. The influence of the speaker impedance is different between tube amplifiers and transistor amplifiers, principally because tube amplifiers normally use output transformers, and cannot use as much negative feedback due to phase problems in transformer circuits. Notable exceptions are various &quot;OTL&quot; (output-transformerless) tube amplifiers, pioneered by Julius Futterman in the 1950s, or somewhat rarer tube amplifiers that replace the impedance matching transformer with additional (often, though not necessarily, transistorized) circuitry in order to eliminate parasitics and musically unrelated magnetic distortions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://milbert.com/tubes_vs_transformers Tubes vs Transformers: An esoteric exploration of tubes, transformers, tone and transcendence]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, many solid-state amplifiers, designed specifically to amplify electric instruments such as guitars or bass guitars, employ current feedback circuitry that increases the amplifier's output impedance, resulting into response similar to that of tube amplifiers.

The design of speaker crossover networks and other electro-mechanical properties may result in a speaker with a very uneven impedance curve, for a nominal 8&amp;nbsp;Ω speaker, being as low as 6&amp;nbsp;Ω at some places and as high as 30–50&amp;nbsp;Ω elsewhere in the curve. An amplifier with little or no negative feedback will always perform poorly when faced with a speaker where little attention was paid to the impedance curve.

==Design comparison==
There has been considerable debate over the characteristics of tubes versus [[bipolar junction transistor]]s. Triodes and [[MOSFET]]s have certain similarities in their transfer characteristics, whereas later forms of the tube, the [[tetrode]] and [[pentode]], have quite different characteristics that are in some ways similar to the bipolar transistor. Despite this, e.g. MOSFET amplifier circuits typically do not reproduce tube sound any more than typical bipolar designs, due to the ''circuit topology differences'' between a typical tube design and a typical MOSFET design. But there are exceptions, for example designs such as the Zen series by [[Nelson Pass]].

===Input impedance===
A characteristic feature of most tube amplifier designs is the high input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (typically 100&amp;nbsp;[[Ohm|k&amp;Omega;]] or more) in modern designs and as much as 1&amp;nbsp;MΩ in classic designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mullard Tube Circuits for Audio Amplifiers |author=R.

By contrast, some transistor amplifiers for home use have lower input impedances, as low as 15&amp;nbsp;kΩ.&lt;ref&gt;Rotel stereo integrated amplifier RA-935BX owners manual. MN10002975-A. p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is possible to use high output impedance devices due to the high input impedance, other factors may need to be accounted for, such as cable capacitance and microphonics in such cases.

===Output impedance===
Audio amplifiers are usually loaded by loudspeakers and in the history nearly all loudspeakers have been electrodynamic loudspeakers, while there exists also minority of electrostatic loudspeakers and some other even more exotic loudspeakers. Electrodynamic loudspeakers transform electric current to force and force to acceleration of the diaphragm which causes sound pressure. Due to the principle of an electrodynamic speaker, most loudspeaker drivers ought to be driven by an electric current signal. The current signal drives the electrodynamic speaker more accurately, causing less distortion than a voltage signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mills |first1=Paul G.

Due to the nature of vacuum tubes and audio transformers, the output impedance of an average tube amplifier is usually considerably higher than of the modern audio amplifiers produced completely without vacuum tubes or audio transformers. Thus, most tube amplifiers with their higher output impedance are less ideal voltage amplifiers than the solid state voltage amplifiers with their smaller output impedance.

===Soft clipping===
Soft clipping is a very important aspect of tube sound especially for [[guitar amplifier]]s, although a [[High fidelity|Hi-fi]] amplifier should not normally ever be driven into clipping. The [[harmonics]] added to the signal are of lower energy with soft clipping than hard clipping. However, soft clipping is not exclusive to tubes, it can be simulated in transistor circuits (below the point that real hard clipping would occur). (See [[#Intentional distortion|&quot;Intentional distortion&quot;]] section).

Large amounts of global negative feedback are not available in tube circuits, due to phase shift in the output transformer, and lack of sufficient gain without large numbers of tubes. With lower feedback, distortion is higher and predominantly of low order. The onset of clipping is also gradual. Large amounts of feedback, allowed by transformerless circuits with many active devices, leads to numerically lower distortion but with more high harmonics, and harder transition to clipping—as input increases, the feedback uses the extra gain to ensure that the output follows it accurately until the amplifier has no more gain to give and the output saturates. However, phase shift is largely an issue only with global feedback loops. Design architectures with local feedback can be used to compensate the lack of global negative feedback magnitude. Design &quot;selectivism&quot; is again a trend to observe: designers of sound producing devices may find the lack of feedback and resulting higher distortion beneficial, designers of sound reproducing devices with low distortion have often employed local feedback loops.

Soft clipping is also not a product of lack of feedback alone: Tubes have different characteristic curves and elementary thing such as bias already affects the designed loadline and resulting clipping characteristics. Fixed and cathode biased amplifiers are also observed to behave and clip differently under overdrive and the type of phase inverter circuitry can also affect greatly on softness (or lack of it) of clipping: long-tailed pair circuit, for example, has softer transition to clipping than a cathodyne, and the coupling of the phase inverter and power tubes is also important since certain types of coupling arrangements (e.g. transformer coupling) can drive power tubes to class AB2 while some other types can't.

In the recording industry and especially with microphone amplifiers it has been shown that amplifiers are often overloaded by signal transients. Russell O. Hamm, an engineer working for [[Walter Sear]] at Sear Sound Studios, wrote in 1973 that there is a major difference between the harmonic distortion components of a signal with greater than 10% distortion that had been amplified with three methods: tubes, transistors, or operational amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamm |first=Russell O. |author= |authorlink= | date=May 1973 |day= |title=Tubes Versus Transistors –Is There an Audible Difference? |journal=J Audio Eng Soc |volume=21 |series= |issue=4 |pages=267–273 |publisher=Audio Engineering Society |location=New York |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |language= |format= |accessdate= |laysummary=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=1980 |laysource=AES |laydate= |quote=This paper, however, points out that amplifiers are often severely overloaded by signal transients ([[Total harmonic distortion|THD]] 30%). Under this condition there is a major difference in the harmonic distortion components of the amplified signal, and operational amplifiers separating into distinct groups.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Russell O. |last=Hamm |author=  |title=Tubes Versus Transistors –Is There an Audible Difference? |url=http://www.milbert.com/tstxt.htm |archiveurl= |work= |publisher=Milbert Amplifiers |location= |doi= |date= |month= |year= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastering engineer R. Steven Mintz wrote a rebuttal to Hamm's paper, saying that the circuit design was of paramount importance, more than tubes vs solid state components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Comments on 'Tubes Versus Transistors – Is There an Audible Difference?' |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=1937 |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society |last=Mintz |first=R. Steven | date=October 1973 |volume=21 |number=8 |page=651}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm's paper was also countered by Dwight O. Monteith Jr and Richard R. Flowers in their article &quot;Transistors Sound Better Than Tubes&quot;, which presented transistor mic preamplifier design that actually reacted to transient overloading similarly as the limited selection of tube preamplifiers tested by Hamm.&lt;ref name=MonteithFlowers&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Audio Eng Soc |publisher=Audio Engineering Society |first=Dwight O. |last=Monteith |title=Transistors Can Sound Better Than Tubes |url=http://radio.feld.cvut.cz/~vlk/dynamics/monteight.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monteith and Flowers said: &quot;In conclusion, the high voltage transistor preamplifier presented here supports the viewpoint of Mintz: 'In the field analysis, the characteristics of a typical system using transistors depends on the design, as is the case in tube circuits. A particular 'sound' may be incurred or avoided at the designer's pleasure no matter what active devices he uses.'&quot;&lt;ref name=MonteithFlowers/&gt;
In other words, soft clipping is not exclusive to vacuum tubes nor even an inherent property of them. In practice the clipping characteristics are largely dictated by the entire circuitry and as so they can range from very soft to very hard, depending on circuitry. Same applies to both vacuum tube and solid-state -based circuitry. For example, solid-state circuitry such as operational transconductance amplifiers operated open loop, or MOSFET cascades of CMOS inverters, are frequently used in commercial applications to generate softer clipping than what is provided by generic triode gain stages. In fact, the generic triode gain stages can be observed to clip rather &quot;hard&quot; if their output is scrutinized with an oscilloscope.

===Bandwidth===
Early tube amplifiers often had limited response [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], in part due to the characteristics of the inexpensive [[Passivity (engineering)|passive components]] then available. In power amplifiers most limitations come from the output transformer; low frequencies are limited by primary inductance and high frequencies by leakage inductance and capacitance. Another limitation is in the combination of high output impedance, decoupling capacitor and grid resistor, which acts as a [[high-pass filter]]. If interconnections are made from long cables (for example guitar to amp input), a high source impedance with high cable capacitance will act as a [[low-pass filter]].

Modern premium components make it easy to produce amplifiers that are essentially flat over the audio band, with less than 3&amp;nbsp;dB attenuation at 6&amp;nbsp;Hz and 70&amp;nbsp;kHz, well outside the audible range.

===Negative feedback===
Typical (non-OTL) tube power amplifiers could not use as much [[negative feedback]] (NFB) as transistor amplifiers due to the large phase shifts caused by the output transformers and their lower stage gains.  While the absence of NFB greatly increases harmonic distortion, it avoids instability, as well as [[slew rate]] and bandwidth limitations imposed by dominant-pole compensation in transistor amplifiers. However, the effects of using low feedback principally apply only to circuits where significant phase shifts are an issue (e.g. power amplifiers). In preamplifier stages high amounts of negative feedback can easily be employed and such designs are commonly found from many tube-based applications aiming to higher fidelity.

Since the alleged phenomenon of transient intermodulation distortion was believed to be mainly caused by negative feedback,&lt;ref&gt;Tapio M. Köykkä, &quot;Katkoäänien rikkoutuminen äänentoistossa&quot; (in Finnish), ''ERT'' (Elektroniikka-Radio-TV), vol. 22, no. 1, pp. 27–32, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matti Otala, &quot;Transient Distortion in Transistorized Audio Power Amplifiers&quot;, IEEE Transactions on Audio and Electroacoustics vol. AU-18, No. 3 September 1970&lt;/ref&gt; tube sound never suffered much of that kind of distortion.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

On the other hand, the dominant pole compensation in transistor amplifiers is precisely controlled: exactly as much of it can be applied as needed to strike a good compromise for the given application.

The effect of dominant pole compensation is that gain is reduced at higher frequencies and therefore there is in fact increasingly less NFB at high frequencies due to the reduced loop gain. This is why amplifiers exhibit increased distortion for higher frequency components of a signal. In effect, transistor amplifiers start to become more &quot;tube like&quot; (employ less negative feedback and distort more) at higher frequencies.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In audio amplifiers, the bandwidth limitations introduced by compensation are still far beyond the audio frequency range, and the slew rate limitations can be configured such that full amplitude 20&amp;nbsp;kHz signal can be reproduced without the signal encountering slew rate distortion, which is not even necessary for reproducing actual audio material.

===Power supplies===

Early tube amplifiers had power supplies based on rectifier tubes. These supplies were unregulated,  a practice which continues to this day in transistor amplifier designs. The typical [[anode]] supply was a [[rectifier]], perhaps half-wave, a choke ([[inductor]]) and a [[Rectifier#Rectifier output smoothing|filter capacitor]]. When the tube amplifier was operated at high volume, due to the high impedance of the rectifier tubes, the power supply voltage would dip as the amplifier drew more current (assuming class AB), reducing power output and causing signal modulation.  The  dipping effect is known as &quot;sag&quot;, which may be desirable effect for some electric guitarists when compared with hard clipping. As the amplifier load or output increases this [[voltage drop]] will increase distortion of the output signal. Sometimes this sag effect is desirable for guitar amplification.

[[File:Blackheart Single ended Class AAmp chassis with the GZ34 rectifier valve installed.jpg|thumb|right|Blackheart 5&amp;nbsp;W single-ended class-A guitar amplifier chassis, with additional GZ34 valve rectifier installed]]

Some instrument tube amplifier designs use a vacuum tube [[rectifier]] instead of silicon diodes, and some designs offer the choice of both rectifiers via a switch. Such an amplifier was introduced in 1989 by Mesa/Boogie, called &quot;Dual Rectifier&quot;, and the rectifier switching is the subject of a patent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5168438.html U.S. Patent 5168438: Selectable dual rectifier power supply for musical amplifier]&lt;/ref&gt;

The voltage sag of a tube rectifier can be emulated with silicon rectifiers,  by adding a resistance in series with the high voltage supply. This resistance can be switched in when required.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.comcast.net/~fredholz/Justin-Holton/The%20Tube%20Rectifier%20Sag%20Mod.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric guitar amplifiers often use a class-AB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; amplifier. In a class-A stage the average current drawn from the supply is constant with signal level, consequently it does not cause supply line sag until the clipping point is reached. Other audible effects due to using a tube [[rectifier]] with this amplifier class are unlikely.

Unlike their solid-state equivalents, tube rectifiers require time to warm up before they can supply B+/HT voltages. This delay can protect rectifier-supplied vacuum tubes from cathode damage due to application of B+/HT voltages before the tubes have reached their correct operating temperature by the tube's built-in heater.&lt;ref&gt;Langford-Smith, F. Radiotron Designer's Handbook 4th Edition. 1952, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class A===
The benefit of all [[class-A amplifier]]s is the absence of [[crossover distortion]]. This crossover distortion was found especially annoying after the first silicon-transistor [[Electronic amplifier#Class B and AB|class-B and class-AB]] transistor amplifiers arrived on the consumer market; earlier germanium-based designs with the much lower turn-on voltage of this technology and the non-linear response curves of the devices had not shown large amounts of cross-over distortion. Although crossover distortion is very fatiguing to the ear and perceptible in listening tests, it is also almost invisible (until looked for) in the traditional [[Total harmonic distortion]] (THD) measurements of that epoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Langford-Smith |first1=F. |title=[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]] |chapter-url=http://www.pmillett.com/Books/RDH4.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= |edition=4th |year=1952 |publisher=Wireless Press |location=Sydney, Australia |page=610 |chapter=14 Fidelity and distortion |quote=One interference which may reasonably be drawn is that any sharp kinks in the linearity curve, as usually occur in any class-AB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amplifier, have a far more serious subjective effect than is indicated by any of the standard methods of measuring distortion –whether total harmonic distortion, conventional weighted distortion factor or the standard form of intermodulation testing. |ref=crossover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Push–pull amplifiers===
A class-A [[Push–pull output|push–pull]] amplifier produces low distortion for any given level of applied [[feedback]], and also cancels the [[flux]] in the [[transformer]] cores, so this topology is often seen by HIFI-audio enthusiasts and do-it-yourself builders as the ultimate engineering approach to the tube [[High fidelity|Hi-fi]] amplifier for use with normal [[loudspeaker|speakers]]. Output power of as high as 15 watts can be achieved even with classic tubes such as the 2A3&lt;ref&gt;Pete Millett's DIY Audio pages. Tube data. [http://www.pmillett.com/tubedata/HB-3/Receiving_Tubes_Part_1/2A3.PDF ''RCA 2A3 Power Triode.'']&lt;/ref&gt; or 18 watts from the type 45. Classic pentodes such as the EL34 and KT88 can output as much as 60 and 100 watts respectively. Special types such as the V1505 can be used in designs rated at up to 1100 watts. See &quot;An Approach to Audio Frequency Amplifier Design&quot;, a collection of reference designs originally published by G.E.C.

===Single-ended triode (SET) amplifiers===
SET amplifiers typically show poor measurements for distortion with a resistive load, have low output power, are inefficient, have poor [[damping factor]]s and high measured harmonic distortion. But they perform somewhat better in dynamic and impulse response.

The triode, despite being the oldest signal amplification device, also can (depending on the device in question) have a more linear no-feedback transfer characteristic than more advanced devices such as beam tetrodes and pentodes.

Audiophiles who prefer SET-amplifiers state that measured sound performance is a poor indicator of real world sound performance and distortion level is not the only criterion for good sound reproduction. There are measurements not using resistive load but actual loudspeakers to back this up. In the 1970s, designers started producing transistor amps with higher [[open loop]] gain to support a greater value of negative feedback. In the following years, amplifiers were built with modest gain but good open loop linearity, deployed with only minimal levels of NFB.

All amplifiers distort, so do SETs. This for the most part [[harmonic]] distortion is a distortion with a unique pattern of simple and monotonically decaying series of harmonics, dominated by modest levels of second harmonic. The result is like adding the same tone one [[octave]] higher. The added harmonic tone is lower, at about 1–5% or less in a no feedback amp at full power and rapidly decreasing at lower levels. It has been also claimed that a single-ended power amplifier's second harmonic distortion could reduce similar harmonic distortion in a single driver loudspeaker, if their harmonic distortions were equal and amplifier was connected to the speaker so that the distortions would neutralize each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audiopax.com/papers_part1.htm About distortion behavior between SE amplifiers and speakers], Eduardo de Lima&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gboers.xs4all.nl/daisy/home/g3/139/g1/loudspeakers/systemdistortion.html System distortion], Gerrit Boers&lt;/ref&gt;

SETs usually only produce about 2&amp;nbsp;[[watt]] (W) for a 2A3 tube amp to 8&amp;nbsp;W for a 300B up to the practical maximum of 40&amp;nbsp;W for an 805 tube amp. The resulting [[sound pressure level]] depends on the sensitivity of the loudspeaker and the size and acoustics of the room as well as amplifier power output. Their low power also makes them ideal for use as [[preamp]]s. SET amps have a power consumption of a minimum of 8 times the stated stereo power. For example a 10&amp;nbsp;W stereo SET uses a minimum of 80&amp;nbsp;W, and typically 100&amp;nbsp;W.

===Single-ended pentode and tetrode amplifiers===
The special feature among tetrodes and pentodes is the possibility to obtain [[Ultra-Linear|ultra-linear]] or distributed load operation with an appropriate output transformer. In practice, in addition to loading the plate terminal, distributed loading (of which ultra linear circuit is a specific form) distributes the load also to cathode and screen terminals of the tube. an Ultra-linear connection and distributed loading are both in essence negative feedback methods, which enable less harmonic distortion along with other characteristics associated with negative feedback. Ultra-linear topology has mostly been associated with amplifier circuits based on research by D. Hafler and H. Keroes of Dynaco fame. Distributed loading (in general and in various forms) has been employed by the likes of McIntosh and Audio Research.

===Class AB===
The majority of modern commercial [[High fidelity|Hi-fi]] amplifier designs have until recently used [[class-AB]] topology (with more or less pure low-level class-A capability depending on the standing bias current used), in order to deliver greater [[Electric power|power]] and [[electrical efficiency|efficiency]], typically 12–25 watts and higher. Modern designs normally include at least some [[Negative feedback amplifier|negative feedback]].  However, class-D topology (which is vastly more efficient than class B, and has garnered some respect from audiophiles) is more and more frequently applied where traditional design would use class AB.

Class-AB push–pull topology is nearly universally used in tube amps for electric guitar applications that produce power of more than about 10 watts. Whereas audiophile amps are primarily concerned with avoiding distortion, a guitar amp embraces it. When driven to their respective limits, tubes and transistors distort quite differently. Tubes clip more softly than transistors, {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} allowing higher levels of distortion (which is sometimes desired by the guitarist) whilst still being able to distinguish the harmonies of a chord. This is because the soft profile of the tube amplifier's distortion means that the [[intermodulation product]]s of the distortion are generally more closely related to the harmonies of the chord. All sides of the question are inclined to agree about valve guitar amplifiers offering a very useful sound, though there are also some well-respected solid-state designs.

==Intentional distortion==

=== Tube sound from transistor amplifiers ===
Some individual characteristics of the tube sound, such as the [[Distortion synthesis|waveshaping]] on overdrive, are straightforward to produce in a transistor circuit or [[digital filter]]. For more complete simulations, engineers have been successful in developing transistor amplifiers that produce a sound quality very similar to the tube sound. Usually this involves using a circuit topology similar to that used in tube amplifiers.

In 1982, [[Tom Scholz]], a graduate of [[MIT]] and a member of ''[[Boston (band)|Boston]]'', introduced the [[Rockman (music)|Rockman]], which used JFET/BJT-based operational amplifiers and diode-based clipping circuits, but achieved a distorted sound adopted by many well known musicians. Advanced [[digital signal processing]] offers the possibility to simulate tube sound. [[Algorithms]] are currently available that transform digital sound from a CD or other digital source into a distorted digital sound signal.

Using modern [[passive component]]s, and modern sources, whether digital or analogue, and wide band [[loudspeaker]]s, it is possible to have tube amplifiers with the characteristic wide bandwidth and &quot;fast&quot; sound of modern transistor amplifiers, including using push–pull circuits, class AB, and feedback. Some enthusiasts, such as [[Nelson Pass]], have built amplifiers using transistors and MOSFETs that operate in class A, including single ended, and these often have the &quot;tube sound&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enjoythemusic.com/magazine/equipment/0701/volksamp.htm |title=The Volksamp Aleph 30 SE Power Amplifier (product review) |author=Olsher, Dick | date=July 2001 |work=Enjoy the Music.com |at=5th paragraph |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |quote=It effectively bridges the gap between solid-state and tube sound, blending tube and transistor virtues into a musically satisfying whole. |ref=aleph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid amplifiers===
Tubes are often used to impart  characteristics that many people find audibly pleasant to solid state amplifiers, such as [[Musical Fidelity]]'s use of [[Nuvistor]]s, tiny triode tubes, to control large bi-polar transistors in their [[NuVista]] 300 power amp. In America, Moscode and Studio Electric use this method, but use MOSFET transistors for power, rather than bi-polar. Pathos, an Italian company, has developed an entire line of hybrid amplifiers.

To demonstrate one aspect of this effect, one may use a light bulb in the feedback loop of an infinite gain multiple feedback (IGMF) circuit. The slow response of the light bulb's resistance (which varies according to temperature) can thus be used to moderate the sound and attain a tube-like &quot;soft limiting&quot; of the output, though other aspects of the &quot;tube sound&quot; would not be duplicated in this exercise.

==Tube sound enthusiasts==
{{Section OR|date=September 2011}}
[[File:RS242 triode 1.png|thumb|Directly heated triodes]]

Different uses of tube amplifiers can be found due to the different personal preferences of the enthusiasts. From those who opt to restrict their use as active devices to those who opt to include them in the audio circuit, accepting the use of semiconductor gain devices in the power supply or as [[constant current source]]s. Others, still, will use tubes for the main amplification circuit but add semiconductors (such as [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[diode]]s) for [[clipping (signal processing)|clipping]] purposes, particularly in the preamp section, which is often debated in advertised vintage instrument amplifiers such as the Marshall JCM900 or the Vintage Modern as to their integrity due to their use of solid-state devices in the tone-generation circuit. Other schisms concern the use of triodes vs. tetrodes and pentodes, and the use of directly heated tubes vs. indirectly heated tubes.

Many of the explanations relate to the circuit topologies pioneered using tubes, and traditionally associated with them ever since, regardless of whether they are built using tubes today, notably the directly heated single-ended triode amplifier circuit, which operates in [[Class-A amplifier|class A]] and often has no external negative feedback; this topology is a classic source of the tube sound. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013|reason=explain how many other(often more popular) circuit architectures would not equally qualify as &quot;classic sources of the tube sound&quot;?}}

Feedback paths coupled through the secondary of the output transformer reduce distortion because they compensate for the transformer's distortion to some extent. However only limited NFB can be used around the transformer, as there is phase lag caused by the transformer, and this causes instability if NFB is incorrectly (without any phase / frequency correction) used.

The '''EL34''' is a thermionic valve or [[vacuum tube]] of the power [[pentode]] type. It has an international [[Tube socket|octal]] base (indicated by the '3' in the part number) and is found mainly in the final output stages of [[sound|audio]] amplification circuits and was designed to be suitable as a series regulator by virtue of its high permissible voltage between heater and cathode and other parameters.  The American [[RETMA tube designation]] number for this tube is '''6CA7'''.  The Russian analog is 6P27S (Cyrillic: 6П27C).

==Specifications==
In common with all 'E' prefix tubes, using the [[Mullard-Philips tube designation]], the EL34 has a heater voltage of 6.3V. According to the data sheets found in old vacuum tube reference manuals, a pair of EL34s with 800V plate voltage can produce 90 watts output in [[Electronic amplifier|class AB1]] in push–pull configuration. However, this configuration is rarely found. One application of this type was in &quot;Australian Sound&quot; public address amplifiers commonly used in government schools in Australia in the 1950s, using four EL34s for ~200 watts.  More commonly found is a pair of EL34s running class AB1 in [[Electronic amplifier|push–pull]] around 375–450V plate voltage and producing 50 watts output (if fixed bias is used), while a quad of EL34s running [[Electronic amplifier|class AB1]] in [[Electronic amplifier|push–pull]] typically run anywhere from 425 to 500V plate voltage and produces 100 watts output.  This configuration is typically found in guitar amplifiers.

[[File:Jj e34l blue glass vacuum tube.jpg|thumb|left|Current production JJ E34L, blue glass edition]]

The EL34 is a pentode, while the 6L6, which delivers a similar range of power output, is a [[beam tetrode]] which [[RCA]] referred to as a ''beam power tube''. Although power pentodes and beam tetrodes have some differences in their principles of operation (the beam forming plates of the beam tetrode or fifth electrode (3rd grid) of the pentode, both serving to hinder the return of unabsorbed electrons from the anode (or plate) to the 4th electrode (2nd grid)) and have some internal construction differences, they are functionally closely equivalent. Unlike the [[6L6]], (EIA base 7AC) the EL34 has its grid 3 connection brought out to a separate Pin (Pin 1) (EIA base 8ET) and its heater draws 1.5 Amps compared to the 0.9 Amp heater in the 6L6. However, Sylvania (and possibly GE) marketed a tube as 6CA7 which was not only in a markedly different 'fat boy' envelope, but used a beam forming plate much like a 6L6. Examining the mica spacer on the top of the tube will confirm the lack of a suppressor grid. Although these tubes have similar (but not identical) characteristics, they are made very differently.

The EL34 was introduced in 1953 by [[Mullard]] and its parent company [[Philips]] and, although no longer made by them, is manufactured by [[JJ Electronic]], Shuguang, Svetlana and [[Reflector (company)|Reflector]] ([[Sovtek]], [[Electro-Harmonix]], [[Tung-Sol]] and some brands), amongst others. Some firms make a related tube called an E34L which is rated to require a higher [[grid bias]] voltage, but which may be interchangeable in some equipment.

==Application==

The EL34 was widely used in higher-powered audio amplifiers of the 1960s and 1970s, such as the very popular [[Dynaco]] [[Dynaco Stereo 70|Stereo 70]]  and the [[LEAK|Leak]] TL25(mono) and Stereo 60, and is also widely used in high-end guitar amplifiers because it is characterized by greater [[distortion]] (considered desirable in this application) at lower power than other octal tubes{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} such as [[6L6]], [[KT88]] or [[6550]].  The EL34 is found in many British guitar amps and is associated with the &quot;British Tone&quot; ([[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]], [[Hiwatt]], [[Orange Amplification|Orange]]) as compared to the 6L6 which is generally associated with the &quot;American Tone&quot; ([[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]/[[Mesa Boogie]], and the earlier classic Marshall &quot;Plexi&quot; amps used the KT 66, a beam tetrode similar to the 6L6, as well).

'''KT66''' is the designator for a [[beam tetrode]] [[vacuum tube]] introduced by [[Marconi-Osram Valve]] Co. Ltd. (M-OV) of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1937.

The KT66 is the direct descendant of the &quot;Harries Valve&quot; developed by British engineer J. Owen Harries and marketed by the Hivac Co. Ltd. in 1935. Harries is believed to be the first engineer to discover the &quot;critical distance&quot; effect, which maximized the efficiency of a power [[tetrode]] by positioning its [[anode]] at a distance which is a specific multiple of the [[screen grid]]-[[cathode]] distance. This design also minimized interference of [[secondary emission]] electrons dislodged from the anode.

[[EMI]] engineers Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda improved the Harries design with a pair of beam plates, connected to the cathode, which directed the electron streams into two narrow areas and also acted like a [[suppressor grid]] to deflect some secondary electrons back to the anode. The beam tetrode design was also undertaken to avoid the [[patent]]s which the giant [[Philips]] firm held on power pentodes in Europe. Because this overall design eliminated the &quot;tetrode kink&quot; in the lower parts of the tetrode's voltage-current characteristic curves (which sometimes caused tetrode amplifiers to become unstable), M-OV marketed this tube family as the &quot;KT&quot; series, standing for &quot;kinkless tetrode&quot;.

A number of different KT tubes were later marketed by M-OV. Some, but not all, were versions of existing American [[beam tetrode]] tubes or European power [[pentode]]s, such as the KT66 (6L6), KT77 (EL34 and 6CA7), [[KT88]] (6550), and KT63 (6V6).

Although the [[RCA]] [[6L6]] of 1936 (the result of a license agreement between RCA and M-OV) was the first true &quot;beam power tube&quot; on the market, the later KT66 became almost equally famous, at least in Europe. The two tubes were nearly interchangeable, except that the KT66 was somewhat more rugged than the early metal 6L6.

[[File:Sovtek kt66 power tetrode.jpg|200px|left]]The KT66 was very popular in European [[radio]]s and audio [[amplifier]]s. It was the standard output tube in the classic [[Quad Electroacoustics|Quad]] II (1952, a version of which is still being manufactured today) and in the [[LEAK]] Type 15 (1945) and TL/12 (1948), both among the earliest British [[hi-fi]] amplifiers. Because of their excellent electrical characteristics and overload tolerance, KT66s are preferred by some guitar players for use in [[guitar amp]]s in place of 6L6GC. However, the plate dissipation of the 6L6GC, at 30W, exceeds the KT66's 25W, and adjustment of the amplifier's [[Grid bias|bias]] is necessary.

M-OV ceased glass vacuum tube manufacture in 1988; their old audio tube types became valuable collectibles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In 2004 original M-OV KT66 tubes (bearing the official &quot;Genalex&quot; marketing brand that M-OV used outside the UK), unused in original carton, sold for US$250. {{As of|2012}} KT66 tubes continued to be manufactured at Reflektor Saratov in Russia, JJ Electronics in Slovakia, and at Liuzhou in China.

Some modern Russian manufacture Sovtek KT66 tubes are actually 6L6GC tubes in a KT66 style bottle. While these tubes have the same pinout and minimum tolerances required of a KT66 tube, they do not have the performance characteristics of a true kinkless tetrode KT66 tube.

By contrast the very latest Russian manufactured tubes (2012) not only carry the same internal electrode structure as the original KT66 (they now look the same) they also have the same rugged electrical characteristics and can with stand a high voltage on grid 2 comparable to the anode voltage rating, allowing greater power output afforded by higher voltage capability when run in ultralinear connection.

The '''Ferranti valve''' is a type of [[vacuum tube]] developed by Messers. [[Ferranti]] Ltd., in measuring the [[charge-to-mass ratio]] of an [[electron]]. It consists of an [[anode]] and two co-axial guard rings. A [[cathode]], as a thin wire of [[tungsten]] filament, runs through this arrangement. When heated to a particular temperature using an HT electricity supply, electrons are emitted.

The '''833A''' is a [[vacuum tube]] constructed for medium power oscillator or class B or C amplifier applications. It is a medium-mu power [[triode]] with 300 watts CCS or 350 watts ICAS anode dissipation. The long grid and anode leads, plus high internal capacitance, limits this tube to 15-30&amp;nbsp;MHz maximum frequency. Being medium mu, it is normally not suitable for grounded grid operation.

== Specifications ==
The 833A is a large tube of the type sometimes known as a &quot;cookie jar&quot; tube,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Harvey. [http://www.meta-gizmo.com/Tri/Dancing/PATH2POW.html Pathways to Power].&lt;/ref&gt; with the envelope nominally measuring 116.8&amp;nbsp;mm (4.60 in.) in diameter and 219.2&amp;nbsp;mm (8.63 in.) in height.  The 833A contains a thoriated tungsten filament rated at 10 volts and 10 amps.  A pair of 833A's with adequate forced air cooling can deliver 1000 watts of CCS RF power operating as a class C amplifier plate modulated stage.  

A pair of tubes used in a class B [[modulator]] can deliver 1800 watts of &quot;peak&quot; AF power in ICAS service with speech, or 1600 watts in CCS service with music or high duty cycle operation. Two 833A's are capable of approximately 800 watts sine wave power in a class B audio amplifier or modulator. This assumes approximately 58% efficiency, 1400 watts input, and 300 watts per tube anode dissipation. The anode normally shows a dull to medium red color when operating at full power.&lt;ref&gt;RCA Transmitting Tubes, TT5, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The tube is supported solely by its two filament posts. These posts are keyed with the F1 and F2 connection having a diameter of 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm (0.375&amp;nbsp;in) and 11.1&amp;nbsp;mm (0.438&amp;nbsp;in) respectively.

The 833A was preceded by the 833.&lt;ref&gt;RCA Transmitting Rubes, TT3, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

The 833A was widely used in small (1&amp;nbsp;kW class) AM broadcast transmitters. Typically, a pair of 833As would be used in the final amplifier, plate modulated by another pair. It was also used in small induction heaters. This tube has also been used by hobbyists to construct a vacuum tube [[Tesla coil]].&lt;ref&gt;Willis, Carl.

'''12AX7''' (also known as ECC83) is a miniature dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] with high voltage [[gain (electronics)|gain]]. It was developed around 1946 by [[RCA]] engineers&lt;ref name=&quot;vintage&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jung|first=David|title=Draw! A 12AX7 'Shooutout'|journal=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]]|date=September 2010|pages=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Camden, New Jersey]], under developmental number A-4522.  It was released for public sale under the 12AX7 identifier on September 15, 1947. The 12AX7 was originally intended as replacement for the [[6SL7]] family of dual-triode amplifier tubes for audio applications. It is popular with tube amplifier enthusiasts, and its ongoing use in such equipment makes it one of the few small-signal vacuum tubes in continuous production since it was introduced.

== History ==
The 12AX7 is basically two 6AV6 triodes in one package.  The 6AV6 was a miniature repackaging (with just a single cathode) of the triode and twin diodes from the octal 6SQ7 (a double-diode triode used in AM radios), which itself was very similar to the older type 75 triode-diode dating from 1930.

{{As of|2012}} the 12AX7 was made in various versions by two factories in [[Russia]] (Winged C, formerly Svetlana, and [[Sovtek|New Sensor]], which produces tubes under the Sovtek, Electro-Harmonix, Svetlana, [[Tung-Sol]], and other brands for which the firm has acquired trademark rights), one in [[China]] (Shuguang), and one in [[Slovakia]] (JJ), for a total annual production estimated at two million units.  The vast majority are used in new-production [[guitar amplifier]]s or for replacements in [[guitar]] and audio equipment.

== Application ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2015}}
The 12AX7 is a high-gain (typical amplification factor 100), low plate current [[triode]] best suited for low-level audio voltage amplification.  In this role it is widely used for the preamplifier (input and mid-level) stages of audio amplifiers. It has relatively high [[Miller effect|Miller]] capacitance, making it unsuitable for radio-frequency use.

Typically a 12AX7 triode is configured with a high-value plate resistor, 100k ohms in most guitar amps and 220k ohms or more in high-fidelity equipment. Grid bias is most often provided by a cathode resistor.  If the cathode resistor is unbypassed, negative feedback is introduced and each half of a 12AX7 provides a typical voltage gain of about 30; the amplification factor is basically twice the maximum stage gain, as the plate impedance must be matched.  Thus half the voltage is across the tube at rest, half across the load resistor. The cathode resistor can be bypassed to reduce or eliminate AC negative feedback and thereby increase gain; maximum gain is about 60 times.

&lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = µ * Rtot / ( rP + Rtot + ( RK * ( µ + 1 )))

Where &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = voltage gain, µ is the amplification factor of the valve, rP is the internal plate resistance,
RK is the cathode resistor and Rtot is the parallel combination of RP (external plate resistor) and Rload.
If the cathode resistor is bypassed, use RK = 0.

The initial &quot;12&quot; in the designator implies a 12-volt heater requirement; however, the tube has a center-tapped heater so it can be used in either 6.3V or 12.6V heater circuits.

== Similar twin-triode designs ==
The 12AX7 was the most common member of what eventually became a large family of twin-triode vacuum tubes, manufactured all over the world, all sharing the same pinout (EIA 9A). Most used heaters which could be optionally wired in series (12.6V, 150&amp;nbsp;mA) or parallel (6.3V, 300&amp;nbsp;mA).  Other tubes, which in some cases could be interchangeable in an emergency, include the [[12AT7]], [[12AU7]], [[12AV7]], and the low-voltage 12U7, plus many 4-digit EIA series dual triodes.  They span a wide range of voltage gain and transconductance. Different versions of each were made for enhanced ruggedness, low [[microphonics]], stability, lifespan, etc.

Those other designs offered lower voltage gain (traded off for higher plate current) than the 12AX7 (which had a voltage gain or &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; of 100), and were more suitable for high-frequency applications.

Some American designs similar to the 12AX7:
* 12ax7-HD (Tube 1965 Created 2015  &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 90 ultra low noise )
* 12AD7 (October 10, 1955 - 225mA heater - low hum)
* [[12AT7]] (May 20, 1947, dual 6AB4, &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 60)
* [[12AU7]] (October 18, 1946, dual 6C4, &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 17-20)
* 12AV7 (February 14, 1950 - dual 6BC4, &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 37-41)
* '''12AX7''' (September 15, 1947 - like miniature 6SL7, &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 100)
* 12AY7 (December 7, 1948 - &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 44, for audio preamp use)
* 12AZ7 (March 2, 1951 - 225mA heater, &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 60)
* 12DF7 (&lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 100, low microphonics)
* 12DT7 (&lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 100)
* 12DW7 (First triode: &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 100, Second triode: &lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 17)
* 12U7  (&lt;math&gt;A_v&lt;/math&gt; = 20, for use in automotive radios on 12-volt plate supply)

Although commonly known in Europe by its [[Mullard-Philips tube designation]] of ECC83, other European variations also existed including the low-[[signal noise|noise]] versions 12AX7A, 12AD7, 6681, 7025, and 7729; European versions B339, B759, CV492, CV4004, CV8156, CV8222, ECC803, ECC803S, E2164, and M8137; and the lower-gain low-noise versions 5751 and 6851, intended for avionics equipment.

In European usage special-quality valves of some sort were often indicated by exchanging letters and digits in the name: the E83CC was a special-quality ECC83.
In the US a &quot;W&quot; in the designation, as in 12AX7WA, designates the tube as complying with military grade, higher reliability specifications.

The 'E' in the European designation classifies this as having a 6.3 volt heater, whereas the American designation of 12AX7 classifies it as having a 12.6 volt heater.  It can, of course, be wired for operation off either voltage.

The '''25L6''' is an [[Tube socket|octal-based]] [[vacuum tube]] of the beam-power [[tetrode]] type. It found common application in AC/DC [[radio receiver]]s  - such as those of the [[All American Five]] type - and was also found in large numbers in early [[computers]], such as the [[UNIVAC I]].

[[Image:BPT Pinout.png|thumb|left|125px|The EIA 7AC pinout]]The tube used EIA base 7AC in common with many other power tubes.  The tube was identical in design and ratings with the '''50L6''' with the exception of having a 25 volt 300 mA heater, whereas the 50L6 has a 50 volt 150 mA heater.  The 12L6 and identical 12W6 were made with a 12 volt, 600 mA heater, and the 6W6 was made with a 6.3V, 1200mA heater. There was also a 35L6 with a 35V, 150 mA heater.  Because of the slightly lower-power heater, the 35L6 has slightly lower output than the rest of the family.  

This family is not to be confused with the [[6L6]] which has the same [[basing diagram]], but has more than twice the power capability of the 25L6. 

[[Image:25L6Tu-g-gt.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Size comparison of a 25L6G with a 25L6GT]]
The 25L6 was introduced as a metal tube November 4, 1936, but most examples of this family were made of glass.  The ST14 Glass 25L6G came out March 30, 1937, The T9 size GT version came out April 11, 1938. There was also a 25L6G in the smaller ST-12 glass envelope.

Computer equipment used this tube as a relay driver or to run the [[solenoid]]s in [[key punch]] machines.  The heater in this case ran off the 24 volt power line in the equipment resulting in long life, and slightly lower power output. The industrial type 6046 is a 25L6GT rated for that application.

A '''Wehnelt cylinder''' (also known as ''Wehnelt cap'', ''grid cap'' or simply ''Wehnelt'') is an [[electrode]] in the [[electron gun]] assembly of some [[thermionic emission|thermionic]] devices, used for focusing and control of the [[electron beam]]. It is named after [[Arthur Wehnelt|Arthur Rudolph Berthold Wehnelt]], a German physicist, who invented it during the years 1902 and 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Ambrose |last= Fleming |title= On the history and development of the thermionic valve |journal= Journal of Scientific Instruments |volume= 11 |issue= 2 |pages= 44 |year= 1934 |doi= 10.1088/0950-7671/11/2/303|bibcode = 1934JScI...11...44F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wehnelt cylinders are found in the electron guns of [[cathode ray tube]]s and [[electron microscope]]s, and in other applications where a thin, well-focused electron beam is required.

==Structure==
A Wehnelt cap has the shape of a topless, hollow cylinder. The bottom side of the cylinder has an aperture (through hole) located at its center, with a diameter that typically ranges from 200 to 1200 µm. The bottom face of the cylinder is often made from platinum or tantalum foil.

==Operation==
A Wehnelt acts as a [[control grid]] and it also serves as a convergent [[electrostatic lens]]. An electron emitter is positioned immediately above the Wehnelt aperture, and an anode is located below the Wehnelt. The anode is biased to a high positive voltage (typically +1 to +30 kV) relative to the emitter so as to accelerate electrons from the emitter towards the anode, thus creating an electron beam that passes through the Wehnelt aperture.

The Wehnelt is biased to a negative voltage (typically −200V to −300V) relative to the emitter, which is usually a [[tungsten]] filament or [[Lanthanum hexaboride]] (LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) [[hot cathode]]. The Wehnelt bias voltage creates a repulsive electrostatic field that condenses the cloud of primary electrons produced by the filament. The filament tip is formed into a &quot;v&quot; shape and located near the aperture so that the beam is emitted from a small area that is, effectively, a circular emission region.

Produced by the German [[Loewe AG]] company as far back as 1926, the device consisted of 3 triode valves (tubes) in a single glass envelope together with all the fixed capacitors and resistors required to make a complete radio receiver. The resistors and capacitors had to be sealed in their own glass tubes to prevent them from contaminating the vacuum. 

The only other parts required to build a [[Radio]] receiver were the tuning coil; the tuning capacitor and the loudspeaker. The device was produced not to enter the [[Integrated circuit]] era several decades early, but to evade German taxes levied on a per valveholder basis. As the Loewe set had only one valveholder, it was able to substantially undercut the competition.   The resultant radio receiver required a 90 volt HT plus a 4 volt LT (A and B) battery (the HT battery provided not only 82.5 volts for the HT but also two grid bias supplies at -1.5 volts and -7.5 volts).

One major disadvantage of the 3NF was that if one filament failed, the whole device was rendered useless. Loewe countered this by offering a filament repair service.

Loewe were to also offer the 2NF (two tetrodes plus passive components) and the WG38 (two pentodes, a triode and the passive components).

The '''evacuation tip''' is a port on any glass envelope or vessel inside of which specific gasses or a vacuum must be held. They are very often seen on [[nixie tube|nixies]] or [[vacuum tube]]s. It used to evacuate gases from the tube, and in the case of nixies, add the proper mix of gases before being sealed. It provides a convenient port for the amateur [[glasshacker]] to introduce gases to alter the performance of the tube. It is also known as the &quot;tubulation&quot; or &quot;pip&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1243">A '''tube caddy''' was a very large carrying case sometimes with hundreds of compartments for [[vacuum tube]]s.  They were carried by repair [[technicians]] who did home service calls in the days when [[Receiver (radio)|radios]] and [[Television#TV_sets|television]] sets were too large and heavy for the average homeowner to bring to the repair shop.  The tube caddy had to be large enough to hold several of each type of tube likely to be needed on a typical day of service calls so that the technician did not need to return to the shop during his rounds.  Because tubes are quite light the caddy did not have to accommodate a large payload and could also be constructed with very light materials so the overall package weighed far less than it appeared to.  Most repairs could be effected with the replacement of tubes since there were few other active components in [[electronics|electronic]] equipment at that time so this was a very efficient way to accomplish fixes.

[[Image:Roehre anode el84.jpg|thumb|The plate from an [[EL84]] [[pentode]] tube widely used in audio amplifiers in 1960s era radios and televisions, and still used in guitar amplifiers]]  
[[File:Triode schematic labeled.svg|thumb|[[Schematic symbol]] used in [[circuit diagram]]s for vacuum tube, showing plate]]

In electronics, a '''plate''', usually called '''anode''' in Britain,  is a type of [[electrode]] that forms part of a [[vacuum tube]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Edison {{US patent|307031}} &quot;Electrical Indicator&quot;, Issue date: 1884&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually made of sheet metal, connected to a wire which passes through the glass envelope of the tube to a terminal in the base of the tube, where it is connected to the external circuit.  The plate is given a positive [[electric potential|potential]], and its function is to attract and capture the electrons emitted by the [[cathode]].  Although it is sometimes a flat plate, it is more often in the shape of a cylinder or flat open-ended box surrounding the other electrodes.

The plate must dissipate heat created when the electrons hit it with a high velocity after being accelerated by the voltage between the plate and cathode.   Most of the waste power used in a vacuum tube is dissipated as heat by the plate.  In low power tubes it is usually given a black coating, and often has &quot;fins&quot; to help it radiate heat.  In power vacuum tubes used in radio transmitters it is often made of a [[refractory metal]] like [[molybdenum]]. and is part of a large [[heat sink]] that projects through the glass or ceramic tube envelope and is cooled by [[Glowing anode|radiation cooling]], forced air or water.&lt;ref&gt;C H Gardner (1965) [http://www.r-type.org/static/story.htm The Story of the Valve], Radio Constructor (See particularly the section &quot;Glass Base Construction&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Tomer, ''Getting the most out of vacuum tubes'', Howard W. Sams, Indianapolis, USA 1960, Library of Congress card no. 60-13843, available on the Internet Archive.  Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem in early vacuum tubes was ''[[secondary emission]]''; electrons striking the plate could knock other electrons out of the metal surface.  In some tubes such as [[tetrode]]s these ''secondary electrons'' could be absorbed by other electrods such as grids in the tube, resulting in a current out of the plate.  This current could cause the plate circuit to have [[negative resistance]], which could cause unwanted [[parasitic oscillation]]s.  To prevent this most plates in modern tubes are given a chemical coating which reduces secondary emission.

A '''klystron''' is a specialized [[linear particle accelerator|linear-beam]] [[vacuum tube]], invented in 1937 by American electrical engineers [[Russell and Sigurd Varian]],&lt;ref name=tubeguys&gt;Pond, Norman H. &quot;The Tube Guys&quot;. Russ Cochran, 2008 p.31-40&lt;/ref&gt; which is used as an [[amplifier]] for high [[radio frequencies]], from [[Ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] up into the [[microwave]] range. Low-power klystrons are used as oscillators in terrestrial [[microwave relay]] communications links, while high-power klystrons are used as output tubes in [[Ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] [[television transmitter]]s, [[satellite communication]], and [[radar]] [[transmitter]]s, and to generate the drive power for modern [[particle accelerator]]s.

In the klystron, an [[electron beam]] interacts with the radio waves as it passes through [[cavity resonator|resonant cavities]], metal boxes along the length of the tube.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilmour&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The energy of the electron beam amplifies the signal, and the amplified signal is taken from a cavity at the other end of the tube.  The output signal can be coupled back into the input cavity to make an [[electronic oscillator]] to generate radio waves.  The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of klystrons can be high, 60&amp;nbsp;dB (one million) or more, with output power up to tens of [[megawatt]]s, but the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] is narrow, usually a few percent although it can be up to 10% in some devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilmour&quot; /&gt;

A ''reflex klystron'' is an obsolete type in which the electron beam was reflected back along its path by a high potential electrode, used as an oscillator.

The name  ''klystron'' comes from the stem form κλυσ- (''klys'') of a [[Greek language|Greek]] verb referring to the action of waves breaking against a shore, and the suffix -τρον (&quot;tron&quot;) meaning the place where the action happens.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Varian |first1=R.

Pacific Books, 1983 p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Prototype klystron cutaway.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The first prototype klystron, manufactured by Westinghouse in 1940. Part of the tube is cut away to show the internal construction.  On the left is the cathode and accelerating anode which creates the electron beam. In the center between the wooden supports is the drift tube, surrounded by the two donut-shaped cavity resonators, the &quot;buncher&quot; and the &quot;catcher&quot;. The output terminal is visible at top. On the right is the cone shaped collector anode which absorbs the electrons.  It could generate 200 W of power at 40 centimeters (750 MHz) with 50% efficiency.]]

The klystron was the first significantly powerful source of radio waves in the [[microwave]] range.  Before its invention the only sources were the [[Barkhausen-Kurz tube]] and [[Magnetron|split anode magnetron]] which were limited to very low power.

The klystron was invented by the brothers [[Russell and Sigurd Varian]] at [[Stanford University]].  Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Varian, Dorothy. &quot;The Inventor and the Pilot&quot;. Pacific Books, 1983 p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon publication in 1939,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of US and UK researchers working on [[radar]] equipment. The Varians went on to found [[Varian Associates]] to commercialize the technology (for example, to make small [[linear accelerators]] to generate photons for external beam [[radiation therapy]]). Their work built on the description of velocity modulation by A. Arsenjewa-Heil and [[Oskar Heil]] (wife and husband) in 1935, though the Varians were probably unaware of the Heils' work.&lt;ref name=Heil&gt;{{cite journal | journal = American Physics Society: Division of Plasma Physics Conference, Pittsburg, PA | title = Invited paper: The Klystron: A microwave source of surprising range and endurance | author = George Caryotakis | publisher = Stanford, CA: Stanford SLAC | date = November 18, 1997 |url = http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-7731.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of physicist [[W.W. Hansen]] was instrumental in the development of the klystron and was cited by the Varian brothers in their 1939 paper.  His resonator analysis, which dealt with the problem of accelerating electrons toward a target, could be used just as well to decelerate electrons (i.e., transfer their kinetic energy to RF energy in a resonator).  During the [[World War II|second World War]], Hansen lectured at the MIT Radiation labs two days a week, commuting to Boston from Sperry gyroscope company on Long Island.  His resonator was called a &quot;rhumbatron&quot; by the Varian brothers.&lt;ref name=tubeguys /&gt;  Hansen died of [[beryllium disease]] in 1949 as a result of exposure to [[beryllium oxide]] (BeO).

During the [[Second World War]], the Axis powers relied mostly on (then low-powered and long wavelength) klystron technology for their radar system microwave generation, while the Allies used the far more powerful but frequency-drifting technology of the [[cavity magnetron]] for much shorter one centimeter microwave generation. Klystron tube technologies for very high-power applications, such as [[synchrotron]]s and radar systems, have since been developed.

Right after WW II AT&amp;T used 4 watt klystrons in its brand new network of microwave links that covered the US continent.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The network provided long distance telephone service and also carried television signals for the major TV networks.  Western Union Telegraph Company also built point-to-point microwave communication links using intermediate repeater stations at about 40 mile intervals at that time, using 2K25 reflex klystrons in both the transmitters and receivers.

== How it works ==
Klystrons amplify RF signals by converting the kinetic energy in a DC electron beam into radio frequency power. A beam of electrons is produced by a [[Hot cathode|thermionic cathode]] (a heated pellet of low [[work function]] material), and accelerated by high-voltage electrodes (typically in the tens of kilovolts). This beam is then passed through an input [[cavity resonator]].  RF energy is fed into the input cavity at, or near, its [[resonant frequency]], creating [[standing wave]]s, which produce an oscillating voltage which acts on the electron beam. The electric field causes the electrons to &quot;bunch&quot;: electrons that pass through when the electric field opposes their motion are slowed, while electrons which pass through when the electric field is in the same direction are accelerated,  causing the previously continuous electron beam to form bunches at the input frequency.  To reinforce the bunching, a klystron may contain additional &quot;buncher&quot; cavities.  The beam then passes through a &quot;drift&quot; tube in which the faster electrons catch up to the slower ones, creating the &quot;bunches&quot;, then through a &quot;catcher&quot; cavity.  In the output &quot;catcher&quot; cavity, each bunch enters the cavity at the time in the cycle when the electric field opposes the electrons' motion, decelerating them.  Thus the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted to potential energy of the field, increasing the amplitude of the oscillations. The oscillations excited in the catcher cavity are coupled out through a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide]].  The spent electron beam, with reduced energy, is captured by a collector electrode.

To make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]], the output cavity can be coupled to the input cavity(s) with a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide]]. [[Positive feedback]] excites spontaneous oscillations at the resonant frequency of the cavities.

==Two-cavity klystron==
[[Image:Klystron.enp.gif|right]]
The simplest klystron tube is the two-cavity klystron.  In this tube there are two microwave cavity resonators, the &quot;catcher&quot; and the &quot;buncher&quot;.  When used as an amplifier, the weak microwave signal to be amplified is applied to the buncher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide, and the amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity.

At one end of the tube is the [[hot cathode]] heated by a filament which produces electrons.  The electrons are attracted and pass through an [[anode]] cylinder at a high positive potential; these act as an [[electron gun]] to produce a high velocity stream of electrons.  An external [[electromagnet]] winding creates a longitudinal [[magnetic field]] along the beam axis which prevents the beam from spreading.

The beam first passes through the &quot;buncher&quot; cavity resonator, through grids attached to each side.  The buncher grids have an oscillating AC potential across them, produced by standing wave oscillations within the cavity, excited by the input signal at the cavity's [[resonant frequency]] applied by a coaxial cable or waveguide.  The direction of the field between the grids changes twice per cycle of the input signal.  Electrons entering when the entrance grid is negative and the exit grid is positive encounter an electric field in the same direction as their motion, and are accelerated by the field.  Electrons entering a half-cycle later, when the polarity is opposite, encounter an electric field which opposes their motion, and are decelerated.

Beyond the buncher grids is a space called the ''drift space''.  This space is long enough so that the accelerated electrons catch up to the retarded electrons, forming &quot;bunches&quot; longitudinally along the beam axis.  Its length is chosen to allow maximum bunching at the resonant frequency, and may be several feet long.

[[File:Klystron oscillator 1944.jpg|thumb|Klystron oscillator from 1944. The electron gun is on the right, the collector on the left.  The two [[cavity resonator]]s are in center, linked by a short coaxial cable to provide positive feedback.]]

The electrons then pass through a second cavity, called the &quot;catcher&quot;, through a similar pair of grids on each side of the cavity.  The function of the ''catcher grids'' is to absorb energy from the electron beam.  The bunches of electrons passing through excite standing waves in the cavity, which has the same resonant frequency as the buncher cavity.  Each bunch of electrons passes between the grids at a point in the cycle when the exit grid is negative with respect to the entrance grid, so the electric field in the cavity between the grids opposes the electrons motion.  The electrons thus do work on the electric field, and are decelerated, their [[kinetic energy]] is converted to electric [[potential energy]], increasing the amplitude of the oscillating electric field in the cavity.  Thus the oscillating field in the catcher cavity is an amplified copy of the signal applied to the buncher cavity.  The amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide.

After passing through the catcher and giving up its energy, the lower energy electron beam is absorbed by a &quot;collector&quot; electrode, a second anode which is kept at a small positive voltage.

===Klystron oscillator===
An [[electronic oscillator]] can be made from a klystron tube, by providing a [[feedback]] path from output to input by connecting the &quot;catcher&quot; and &quot;buncher&quot; cavity with a [[coaxial cable]] or [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]].  When the device is turned on, [[electronic noise]] in the cavity is amplified by the tube and fed back from the output catcher to the buncher cavity to be amplified again.  Because of the high [[Q factor|Q]] of the cavities, the signal quickly becomes a sine wave at the [[resonant frequency]] of the cavities.

==Multicavity klystron==
In all modern klystrons, the number of cavities exceeds two.  Additional &quot;buncher&quot; cavities added between the first &quot;buncher&quot; and the &quot;catcher&quot; may be used to increase the gain of the klystron, or to increase the bandwidth.

The residual kinetic energy in the electron beam when it hits the collector electrode represents wasted energy, which is dissipated as heat, which must be removed by a cooling system.  Some modern klystrons include depressed collectors, which recover energy from the beam before collecting the electrons, increasing efficiency.  Multistage depressed collectors enhance the energy recovery by &quot;sorting&quot; the electrons in energy bins.

==Reflex klystron==
[[Image:ExKlystron.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Low-power Russian reflex klystron from 1963.  The [[cavity resonator]] from which the output is taken, is attached to the electrodes labeled ''Externer Resonator''.  Reflex klystrons are almost obsolete now.]]

{{main|Sutton tube}}

The [[reflex klystron]] (also known as a [[Sutton tube]] after one of its inventors, Robert Sutton) was a low power klystron tube with a single cavity, which functioned as an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]].  It was used as a [[local oscillator]] in some radar receivers and a [[modulator]] in microwave transmitters the 1950s and 60s, but is now obsolete, replaced by semiconductor microwave devices.

In the reflex klystron the electron beam passes through a single resonant cavity. The electrons are fired into one end of the tube by an [[electron gun]]. After passing through the resonant cavity they are reflected by a negatively charged reflector electrode for another pass through the cavity, where they are then collected.  The electron beam is velocity modulated when it first passes through the cavity. The formation of electron bunches takes place in the drift space between the reflector and the cavity. The [[volt]]age on the reflector must be adjusted so that the bunching is at a maximum as the electron beam re-enters the resonant cavity, thus ensuring a maximum of energy is transferred from the electron beam to the [[Radio frequency|RF]] oscillations in the cavity. The reflector voltage may be varied slightly from the optimum value, which results in some loss of output power, but also in a variation in frequency. This effect is used to good advantage for automatic frequency control in receivers, and in [[frequency modulation]] for transmitters. The level of modulation applied for transmission is small enough that the power output essentially remains constant. At regions far from the optimum voltage, no oscillations are obtained at all.

There are often several regions of reflector voltage where the reflex klystron will oscillate; these are referred to as modes. The electronic tuning range of the reflex klystron is usually referred to as the variation in frequency between half power points&amp;mdash;the points in the oscillating mode where the power output is half the maximum output in the mode.

Modern [[semiconductor]] technology has effectively replaced the reflex klystron in most applications.

== Tuning ==
[[Image:Aust.-Synchrotron,-Klystron-for-Storage-Ring,-14.06.2007.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Large klystrons as used in the [[storage ring]] of the [[Australian Synchrotron]] to maintain the energy of the [[electron]] beam]]

Some klystrons have cavities that are tunable.  By adjusting the frequency of individual cavities, the technician can change the operating frequency, gain, output power, or bandwidth of the amplifier. No two klystrons are exactly identical (even when comparing like part/model number klystrons). Each unit has manufacturer-supplied calibration values for its specific performance characteristics. Without this information, the klystron would not be tunable properly, and hence not perform well, if at all.

Tuning a klystron is delicate work which, if not done properly, can cause damage to equipment or injury to the technician due to the very high voltages that could be produced. The technician must be careful not to exceed the limits of the graduations, or damages to the klystron can result. Other precautions taken when tuning a klystron include using nonferrous tools. Some klystrons employ permanent [[magnets]].  If a technician uses [[ferrous]] tools (which are [[ferromagnetic]]) and comes too close to the intense magnetic fields that contain the electron beam, such a tool can be pulled into the unit by the intense magnetic force, smashing fingers, injuring the technician, or damaging the unit. Special lightweight nonmagnetic (aka [[diamagnetic]]) tools made of [[beryllium]] alloy have been used for tuning U.S. Air Force klystrons.

Precautions are routinely taken when transporting klystron devices in aircraft, as the intense magnetic field can interfere with magnetic navigation equipment. Special overpacks are designed to help limit this field &quot;in the field,&quot; and thus allow such devices to be transported safely.

==Optical klystron==
The technique of amplification used in the klystron is also being applied experimentally at optical frequencies in a type of [[laser]] called the [[free-electron laser]] (FEL); these devices are called ''optical klystrons''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonifacio&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The electron beam passes through an undulator, in which a laser light beam causes bunching of the electrons.  Then the beam passes through a second undulator, in which the electron bunches cause oscillation to create a second, more powerful light beam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonifacio&quot; /&gt;

==Floating drift tube klystron==
The floating drift tube klystron has a single cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated central tube. Electrically, this is similar to the two cavity oscillator klystron with a lot of feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based. It only needs one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.

==Applications==
Klystrons can produce far higher microwave power outputs than [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] microwave devices such as [[Gunn diode]]s.  In modern systems, they are used from UHF (hundreds of MHz) up through hundreds of gigahertz (as in the Extended Interaction Klystrons in the [[CloudSat]] satellite).  Klystrons can be found at work in [[radar]], satellite and wideband high-power communication (very common in [[television]] [[broadcasting]] and EHF [[satellite]] terminals), medicine (radiation oncology), and [[high-energy physics]] ([[particle accelerator]]s and experimental reactors). At [[SLAC]], for example, klystrons are routinely employed which have outputs in the range of 50 megawatts (pulse) and 50 kilowatts (time-averaged) at 2856&amp;nbsp;MHz.  The [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo Planetary Radar]] uses two klystrons that provide a total power output of 1 megawatt (continuous) at 2380&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=D.

A '''field emission gun''' is a type of [[electron gun]] in which a sharply pointed Müller-type{{clarify|reason=what is this?|date=July 2014}} emitter is held at several kilovolts negative [[potential]] relative to a nearby [[electrode]], so that there is sufficient potential [[gradient]] at the emitter surface to cause [[field electron emission]]. Emitters are either of [[cold-cathode]] type, usually made of single crystal tungsten sharpened to a tip radius of about 100 nm, or of the [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] type, in which [[thermionic emission]] is enhanced by barrier lowering in the presence of a high electric field. Schottky emitters are made by coating a tungsten tip with a layer of [[zirconium oxide]], which has the unusual property of increasing in [[electrical conductivity]] at high temperature.  

In  [[electron microscope]]s, a field emission gun is used to produce an electron beam that is smaller in diameter, more coherent and with up to three orders of magnitude greater current density or brightness than can be achieved with conventional [[thermionic emission|thermionic emitters]] such as tungsten or [[lanthanum hexaboride]] ({{chem|LaB|6}})-tipped filaments. The result in both [[scanning electron microscope|scanning]] and [[transmission electron microscope|transmission electron microscopy]] is significantly improved [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and spatial resolution, and greatly increased emitter life and reliability compared with thermionic devices.

The '''866''' is a [[Mercury-arc valve|mercury vapor]] [[Rectifier#Half-wave rectification|half-wave rectifier]] intended for [[high-voltage]] applications. The voltage drop is approximately 15&amp;nbsp;volts up to 150&amp;nbsp;Hz. To avoid unwanted shorts the tube must be operated in a vertical position and the [[Heating element|filament]] preheated for at least 30 seconds before applying the plate voltage.

==Construction==
Structurally, it consists of a linear [[electrode]] arrangement; a cup shaped anode with top cap and a cylindrical [[cathode]]. The socket is a medium 4 pin bayonet [[Tube socket#Early bases|UX-4]] and the glass envelope is ST-19. The 2.5 volt/ 5 Amp filament is connected to pins 1 and 4.

==Operation==
Under normal operating conditions the tube glows blue and mercury droplets are visible.

[[Image:12SA7GT GridDetail.jpg|right|148px|thumb|Grids of a 12SA7GT pentagrid converter, showing all five grids]]

The '''pentagrid converter''' is a type of radio receiving valve ([[vacuum tube]]) with five grids used as the [[frequency mixer]] stage of a [[superheterodyne]] radio receiver.

The pentagrid was part of a line of development of valves that were able to take an incoming RF signal and change its frequency to a fixed [[intermediate frequency]] which was then amplified, and detected in the remainder of the receiver circuitry.  The device was generically referred to as a ''frequency changer'' or just ''mixer''.

==Origins==
The first devices designed to change frequency in the manner described above seem to have been developed by the French, who simply put two grids into what would otherwise have been an ordinary [[triode]] valve (the ''bi-grille'').  Although technically a four-component [[electrode]] device, neither the term [[tetrode]] nor the tetrode valve as it is known today had yet appeared.  Each grid was able to accept one of the incoming signals and the non-linearity of the device produced the sum and difference frequencies.  The valve would have been very inefficient but, most importantly, the capacitive coupling between the two grids would have been very large.  It would therefore have been quite impossible to prevent the signal from one grid coupling out of the other.  At least one reference claims that the ''bi-grille'' was self-oscillating, but this has not been confirmed.

In 1918, [[Edwin Armstrong]] used only triodes when he invented the [[superheterodyne receiver]].  One triode operated in a conventional oscillator circuit. Another triode acted as a mixer by coupling the oscillator signal into the mixer's cathode, and the received signal to the grid. The sum and difference frequencies were then available in the mixer's [[anode]] circuit.  Once again, the problem of coupling between the circuits would be ever present.

Shortly after Armstrong invented the superhet, a triode mixer stage design was developed that not only mixed the incoming signal with the local oscillator, but the same valve doubled as the oscillator.  This was known as the [[autodyne]] mixer.  Early examples had difficulty oscillating across the frequency range because the oscillator feedback was via the first [[intermediate frequency]] [[transformer]] primary tuning capacitor which was too small to give good feedback.  Also keeping the oscillator signal out of the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] circuit was difficult.

The invention of the tetrode demonstrated the idea of screening electrodes from each other by using additional earthed (grounded) grids (at least as far as the signal was concerned).  In 1926, Philips invented a technique of adding yet another grid to combat the [[secondary emission]] that the tetrode suffered from.  All the ingredients for the pentagrid were now in place.

==Pentagrid==
[[File:Heptode.svg|thumb|100px|Circuit symbol of a heptode]]

The development of the pentagrid or '''heptode''' (seven-electrode) valve was a novel development in the mixer story.  The idea was to produce a single valve that not only mixed the oscillator signal and the received signal and produced its own oscillator signal at the same time but, importantly, did the mixing and the oscillating in different parts of the same valve.

The invention of the device at first sight doesn't seem to be obscure, but it would appear that it was developed in both America and the United Kingdom, more or less at the same time.  However, the UK device is different from its American counterpart.

It is known that Donald G. Haines of RCA applied for a patent for the pentagrid on 28 March 1933 (subsequently granted on 29 March 1939) under US patent number 2,148,266.  The pentagrid also featured in a UK patent (GB426802) granted on 10 April 1935.  However, the Ferranti company of Great Britain entered the valve business with the first known UK-produced pentagrid, the '''VHT4''', late in 1933 (though it must have been in development, and would certainly have existed as a prototype well before that time).

The pentagrid proved to be a much better mixer.  Since the oscillator circuit was more or less self-contained, good feedback for reliable oscillation across the frequency range was easy to obtain.  Some manufacturers that had adopted the [[autodyne]] mixer converted some, if not all, of their designs to pentagrid mixers.

What was the goal to develop a reliable self-oscillating mixer?  The reasons were to differ from the UK to America.  The UK radio manufacturers had to pay a royalty of £1 per valve holder to the [[British Valve Association]] to cover use of their members' patent rights.  Further, they dictated that not more than one electrode structure could be contained in a single envelope (which would have evaded the royalty - at least in part).  The Americans appeared to be driven by the desire to produce a low-cost 'every expense spared' design which was to lead to the [[All American Five]].  By making the mixer self-oscillate, the necessity of providing a separate oscillator valve is avoided.  The All American Five was to use a pentagrid converter from when it first appeared in 1934, right up until valves became obsolete when transistors took over.

In the UK, the five grids operated thus.  Grid 1 acted as the oscillator grid in conjunction with grid 2 which acted as its anode.  Grid 4 accepted the incoming signal with the remaining two grids, 3 and 5 connected together (usually internally) which acted as screen grids to screen the anode, grid 4 and grid 2 from each other.  Because grid 2 was a 'leaky' anode in that it allowed part of the modulated electron stream through, the oscillator was coupled into the mixing section of the valve.  In fact, in some designs, grid 2 consisted of just the support rods, the actual grid wire itself being omitted.

In America, the configuration was different.  Grid 1 acted as the oscillator grid as before, but in this case, grids 2 and 4 were connected together (again usually internally).  Grid 2 functioned as both a screen and the oscillator anode; in this case the grid wire had to be present to provide the screening.  Grid 3 accepted the incoming signal.  Grid 4 screened this from the anode, and grid 5 was a suppressor grid to suppress secondary emission.  This configuration limited the oscillator design to one where the oscillator 'anode' was operated from the HT+ (B+) rail.  This was often accomplished by using a [[Hartley Oscillator]] circuit and taking the cathode to the tap on the coil.

It will be noted that the UK version would have had significant secondary emission and would also have had a [[tetrode|tetrode kink]].  This was exploited in providing the non linearity necessary to produce good sum and difference signals.  The American devices although having no secondary emission due to the suppressor grid, nevertheless were able to get the required non linearity by biasing the oscillator such that the valve was overdriven.  The American version was also a little more sensitive because the grid that accepted the signal was closer to the cathode increasing the amplification factor.

The pentagrid converter in either guise operated extremely well, but it suffered from the limitation that a strong signal was able to 'pull' the oscillator frequency away from a weaker signal.  This was not considered a major problem in broadcast receivers where the signals were likely to be strong, but it became a problem when trying to receive weak signals that were close to strong signals.  Some short wave radios managed quite satisfactorily with these devices.  Special high frequency versions appeared after World War II for the 100&amp;nbsp;MHz FM bands.  Examples are the '''6SB7Y''' (1946) and the '''6BA7''' (1948).  The pulling effect had a beneficial side effect in that it gave a degree of automatic tuning.

Another disadvantage was that in spite of the presence of the screen grids, the electron beam, modulated by the oscillator electrodes, still had to pass through the signal grid, and coupling of the oscillator into the signal circuit was inevitable.  The American [[Federal Communication Commission]] (FCC) started requiring radio manufacturers to certify that their products avoided this interference under Part 15 of their rules.  In the UK, the Postmaster General (who was responsible for radio licensing), laid down a set of stringent rules concerning radio interference.

==Hexode==
[[File:Hexode symbol.svg|thumb|100px|Circuit symbol of a hexode]]

The '''hexode''' (six-electrode) was actually developed after the heptode or pentagrid.  It was developed in Germany as a mixer but was designed from the start to be used with a separate triode oscillator.  Thus the grid configuration was grid 1, signal input; grids 2 and 4 screen grids (connected together - again, usually internally) and grid 3 was the oscillator input.  The device had no suppressor grid.  A major advantage was that by using grid 1 as the signal input grid, the device was more sensitive to weak signals.

It was not long before the triode and hexode structures were placed in the same glass envelope - by no means a new idea.  The triode grid was usually internally connected to the hexode grid 3, but this practice was dropped in later designs when the mixer section operated as a straight IF amplifier in AM/FM sets when operating on FM, the mixing being carried out in a dedicated FM frequency changing section.

The UK manufacturers were initially unable to use this type of mixer because of the [[British Valve Association|BVA]] prohibition on multiple structures (and indeed unwilling to use separate valves because of the levy).  One UK company, [[Marconi-Osram Valve|MOV]], successfully enforced the cartel rules against the German Lissen company in 1934 when they attempted to market a radio in the UK which had the triode-hexode mixer.

Following pressure from the UK manufacturers, the BVA were compelled to relax the rules and the UK started to adopt triode-hexode mixers.  The [[Mullard]] '''ECH35''' was a popular choice.

One company, [[Osram]], made an ingenious move.  One of their popular pentagrid converter designs was the '''MX40''', initially marketed in 1934.  They put on sale in 1936, the '''X41''' triode-hexode frequency changer.  The clever bit was that the '''X41''' was a direct plug-in pin-compatible replacement for the MX40.  Thus a pentagrid radio could easily be converted to a triode-hexode without any other circuit modifications.

America never really adopted the triode-hexode and it was seldom used, even though the '''6K8''' triode-hexode was available to manufacturers in 1938.

In some designs, a suppressor grid was added to produce yet another heptode design.  Mullard's '''ECH81''' became popular with the move to miniature nine-pin valves.

==Octode==
[[Image:Mixer oktode.png|right|162px|thumb|Octode-based pentagrid converter circuit]]
Although not strictly a pentagrid (in that it has more than five grids), the '''octode''' (eight-electrode) nevertheless operates on the pentagrid principle.  It resulted simply from the addition of an extra screen grid to the UK version of the pentagrid heptode.  This was done mainly to improve the antenna/oscillator separation and to reduce the power consumption for use in radio sets operated by dry batteries that were becoming increasingly popular.

In North America, the only octode manufactured was the '''7A8'''.  Introduced by [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]] in 1939 (and used mostly by [[Philco]]), this valve was the product of adding a suppressor grid to type '''7B8''', which was the [[Loctal base|loctal]] version of type '''6A7'''.  Adding the suppressor allowed Sylvania to lower the current of the 6.3-volt heater from 320 milliamperes&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/084/7/7B8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to 150 milliamperes&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/108/7/7A8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining the same conversion [[transconductance]] (550 microsiemens).  This allowed Philco to use this valve in every line of radio throughout the 1940s.

The Philips '''EK3''' octode was designated as a 'beam octode'.  The novel part about the design was that grids 2 and 3 were constructed as beam forming plates.  This was done in such a way that Philips claimed that the oscillator electron beam and the mixer electron beams were separated as much as possible and thus the pulling effect was minimised.&lt;ref&gt;http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/046/e/EK3.pdf Manufacturer's marketing information.&lt;/ref&gt;  No information is available as to the degree of success.  The manufacturer's information also notes that the valve's high performance comes at a cost of a high heater current of 600 mA – double that of more conventional types.

==Pentode==
{{main|Pentode}}
The use of a [[pentode]] would seem an unlikely choice for a frequency converter because it only has one control grid.  However, during the [[Great Depression]], many American radio manufacturers used pentode types '''6C6''', '''6D6''', '''77''' and '''78''' in their lowest priced AC/DC receivers because they were cheaper than pentagrid type '''6A7'''.  In these circuits, the suppressor (grid 3) acted as the oscillator grid, and the valve operated in a similar manner to a true pentagrid.

One UK company, [[Mazda (light bulb)|Mazda]], produced a triode-pentode frequency changer, the '''AC/TP'''.  Designed for low-cost AC radios, the device was deliberately designed to allow strong signals to pull the oscillator without the risk of radiating the oscillator signal from the aerial.  The cathode was common to both sections of the valve.  The cathode was connected to a secondary coil on the oscillator coil and thus coupled the oscillator into the pentode mixer section, the signal being applied to grid 1 in the conventional manner.  The AC/TP was one of the AC/ range of valves designed for low-cost radios.  They were considered durable for their time (even the AC/TP frequency changer, which was normally problematic).  Any AC/ valves encountered today are likely to be brand new as service shops stocked up on spares which were seldom required.

==Nomenclature==
In order to distinguish between the two versions of the heptode, manufacturers data often describes them as 'heptode of the hexode type' for a heptode without a suppressor grid, and a 'heptode of the octode type', where a suppressor grid is present.

A '''Gyrotron''' is a high-power linear-beam [[vacuum tube]] which generates [[millimeter wave|millimeter-wave]] electromagnetic waves by the [[cyclotron resonance]] of [[electron]]s in a strong [[magnetic field]]. Output [[Frequency|frequencies]] range from about 20 to 250 [[GHz]], covering wavelengths from [[microwave]] to the edge of the [[terahertz gap]]. Typical output [[Power (physics)|power]]s range from tens of [[kilowatt]]s to 1–2 [[megawatt]]s. Gyrotrons can be designed for pulsed or continuous operation.

==Principle of operation==
[[Image:Gyrotron plateforme.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|High-power 84–118 GHz gyrotron tubes for plasma heating in the [[Tokamak à configuration variable|TCV]] [[tokamak]] fusion reactor, Switzerland. The colored cylinders are the tops of the gyrotron tubes.]]
[[Image:Gyrotron.png|thumb|Diagram of a gyrotron]]

The gyrotron is a type of free-electron [[maser]] which generates high-frequency electromagnetic radiation by stimulated [[cyclotron resonance]] of electrons moving through a strong magnetic field.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge12&quot;&gt;{{cite web

This is unlike conventional microwave [[vacuum tube]]s such as [[klystron]]s and [[magnetron]]s, in which the wavelength is determined by a single-mode [[resonant cavity]], a ''slow-wave'' structure, and thus as operating frequencies increase, the resonant cavity structures must decrease in size, which limits their power-handling capability.

In the gyrotron a hot [[electrical filament|filament]] in an [[electron gun]] at one end of the tube emits an annular-shaped (hollow tubular) beam of [[electron]]s, which is accelerated by a high-voltage [[anode]] and then travels through a large tubular resonant cavity structure in a strong axial [[magnetic field]], usually created by a [[superconducting magnet]] around the tube.  The field causes the electrons to move [[helix|helically]] in tight circles around the magnetic field lines as they travel lengthwise through the tube.  At the position in the tube where the magnetic field reaches its maximum the electrons radiate electromagnetic waves in a transverse direction (perpendicular to the axis of the tube) at their [[cyclotron resonance]] frequency.  The millimeter radiation forms standing waves in the tube, which acts as an open-ended [[resonant cavity]], and is formed into a beam, which radiates through a window in the side of the tube into a [[waveguide]].  The spent electron beam is absorbed by a collector electrode at the end of the tube.

As in other linear-beam microwave tubes, the energy of the output electromagnetic waves comes from the [[kinetic energy]] of the electron beam, which is due to the accelerating anode voltage.  In the region before the resonant cavity where the magnetic field strength is increasing, it compresses the electron beam, converting the longitudinal drift velocity to transverse orbital velocity, in a process similar to that occurring in a [[magnetic mirror]] used in [[plasma confinement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Borie&quot; /&gt;  The orbital velocity of the electrons is 1.5 to 2 times their axial beam velocity.   Due to the standing waves in the resonant cavity, the electrons become &quot;bunched&quot;; that is, their phase becomes synchronized so they are all at the same point in their orbit at the same time.  Therefore, they emit coherent radiation. 
  
The electron speed in a gyrotron is slightly relativistic (comparable to but not close to the speed of light). This contrasts to the [[free-electron laser]] (and [[xaser]]) that work on different principles and whose electrons are highly relativistic.

==Applications==
Gyrotrons are used for many industrial and high-technology heating applications. For example, gyrotrons are used in [[nuclear fusion]] research experiments to heat [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] and also in manufacturing industry as a rapid heating tool in processing glass, composites, and ceramics, as well as for annealing (solar and semiconductors). Military applications include the [[Active Denial System]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3999">'''Output transformerless''' ('''OTL''') is a term which describes a subset of [[vacuum tube]] audio [[power amplifier]] topologies, all of which omit an [[Transformer types#Audio transformer|output transformer]] for the purpose of greater linearity and fidelity. Conventional vacuum tube amplifier designs rely upon an output transformer to couple the amplifier's output stage to the [[loudspeaker]]. Instead, OTLs use one of two primary methods for output stage coupling: direct coupling (DC) or capacitive coupling (AC).

== Additional definitions ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
There is some contention with respect to applying the broader term &quot;OTL&quot; to capacitively coupled designs and variants. The need to delineate these designs from their directly coupled counterparts has led to the informal adoption of several additional terms, including:

* '''OCL''' ('''output capacitorless''') - which distinguishes OTL designs lacking an output coupling capacitor (directly coupled)
* '''DC-OTL''' - which denotes a directly coupled design; synonymous with OCL
* '''AC-OTL''' - which denotes an AC (capacitively) coupled design
* '''Z-OTL''' - which denotes a small class of variants

== Differentiation of designs ==

=== By coupling methods: direct versus capacitive coupling and variants ===

Background: The output coupling method of a vacuum tube amplifier generally serves two basic purposes:

* Negation (blocking) of high DC voltages in the output section to prevent a damaging flow of direct electric current through the loudspeaker.
* Matching the relatively high output [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the conventional vacuum tube to the relatively low impedance of conventional loudspeakers.

==== Direct coupled designs ====

In direct coupled OTL designs, both the necessary blocking of DC and matching of impedances are accomplished, respectively, through the topology of the amplifier's output section and the selection of vacuum tube types with sufficiently low impedance to allow effective power transfer to the loudspeaker. Typically, direct coupled OTL amplifiers will have a user-adjustable '''DC offset''' control, which allows the user to trim off any residual DC voltage residing at the amplifier's output terminals prior to operation. Servo-controlled variants also exist.

==== Capacitively coupled designs ====

Like the direct coupled designs, capacitively coupled designs rely on the selection of tube types with a sufficiently low impedance to effect the transfer of power to the loudspeaker. However, unlike direct coupled designs, capacitively coupled designs do not have inherent DC blocking by virtue of their topology. Instead, DC voltage in the output section is blocked by an ''output coupling capacitor'' - typically a large-value (3000-6000μF) electrolytic capacitor - which is interposed between the amplifier's output section and the loudspeaker.

=== By output section topology ===

There are several practical approaches to the design of an OTL amplifier's output section, each with their own respective strengths and weaknesses. While certain topologies lend themselves well to direct coupling, others are more suitable for capacitive coupling. The various designs in service may thus be grouped based upon their common output section topologies. Common topologies include:

* ''Futterman'' type and variants (Examples: Counterpoint, Fourier, Julius Futterman, New York Audio Labs (NYAL), Prodigy Audio Labs., Silvaweld et al.)
* ''[[Circlotron]]'' type (Examples: Atma-Sphere Music Systems,&lt;ref&gt;[[Atma-Sphere Music Systems, Inc|Atma-Sphere's]] patented technology [http://www.atma-sphere.com/Resources/OTLs_Defined.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Joule Electra, Tenor et al.)
* ''Totem-pole'' type (Many examples)
* ''H-bridge'' type (Few examples)
* ''Single-ended'' type (Examples: Transcendent Sound SE-OTL, various low-power headphone amplifiers)

The type '''SY4307A''' is a power output [[pentode]] possessing a similar power rating, but significantly different characteristics to the far more common type [[807 (vacuum tube)|807]] thermionic valve/vacuum tube.

==Uses==

Although the 807 is used for both audio amplification, (usually [[class AB]], and radio frequency amplification in the 1-30&amp;nbsp;MHz range, (usually [[class C]]), this type was usually used for the latter.&lt;br /&gt;
This tube/valve is a pentode with a 'directly heated cathode', meaning that the cathode consists of an emissive oxide coated filament. These features suggest the SY4307A could predate and is contemporary with, the 807 which is a beam power tetrode, a more advanced design with a more linear transfer characteristic and a more complex 'indirectly heated cathode'.

==Similarity to 807==

If the pinout of the SY4307A is compared to that of the 807 the similarity is striking. All pins are assigned equivalent electrodes with the exception of pin 4, which is the suppressor grid, g3, in this type but in the 807 pin 4 is the connected to equivalent of a suppressor grid, the 'beam plates' and also the separate indirectly heated cathode.
It is possible to interchange the two with the relatively minor alteration involving the linking of pins 4 and 5 and ensuring the heater supply is [[Floating_ground|Floating]]{{dn|date=April 2014}} (not connected to other heaters). If the heater is supplied from an [[Alternating current|A.C.]] source, linking pin 4 to the centre of that source and the cathode [[bootstrap]] minimizes hum pickup.

==Historical significance==

The SY4307A was used extensively during World War II by the Australian armed forces and the example depicted is marked on the [[Bakelite]] collar of its base with the &quot;D broad arrow D&quot; commonwealth department of defense mark. &lt;br /&gt;
Two SY4307As were used, wired in parallel, as the output stage, or &quot;[[Finality|final]]&quot;, in a transmitter constructed clandestinely by the Australian soldiers of Sparrow Force in Japanese occupied Portuguese Timor in 1942. This transmitter became known affectionately as &quot;[http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/japadvance/boots.html Winnie the War Winner]&quot;, named after the British wartime Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]].

A '''voltage reference''' is an electronic device that ideally produces a fixed (constant) voltage irrespective of the loading on the device, power supply variations, temperature changes, and the passage of time. Voltage references are used in [[power supply|power supplies]], [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, [[digital-to-analog converter]]s, and other measurement and control systems. Voltage references vary widely in performance; a regulator for a computer power supply may only hold its value to within a few per cent of the nominal value, whereas laboratory voltage standards have precisions and stability measured in [[parts per million]].

== In metrology ==

The earliest voltage references or standards were wet-chemical cells such as the [[Clark cell]] and [[Weston cell]], which are still used in some laboratory and calibration applications.

Laboratory-grade [[Zener diode]] secondary solid-state voltage standards used in [[metrology]] can be constructed with a drift of about 1 part per million per year.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Kochsiek, Michael Gläser, ''Handbook of Metrology'',  Wiley-VCH, 2010 ISBN 3-527-40666-2  p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the &quot;[[Conventional electrical unit| conventional]]&quot; [[volt]] is now maintained by superconductive integrated circuits using the [[Josephson Effect]] to get a voltage to an accuracy of 1 [[parts per billion]] or better, the [[Josephson voltage standard]]. The paper titled, &quot;Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling&quot;, was published by [[Brian David Josephson]] in 1962 and earned Josephson the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973.

Formerly, [[mercury battery|mercury batteries]] were much used as convenient voltage references especially in portable instruments such as photographic [[light meter]]s; mercury batteries had a very stable discharge voltage over their useful life.

==Solid state devices==

Any semiconductor [[diode]] has an exponential voltage /current characteristic that gives an effective &quot;knee&quot; voltage sometimes used as a voltage reference. This voltage ranges from 0.3 V for [[germanium]] diodes up to about 3 volts for certain [[light emitting diode]]s.  These devices have a strong temperature dependence, which may make them useful for temperature measurement or for compensating [[biasing|bias]] in analog circuits.

[[Zener diode]]s are also frequently used to provide a reference voltage of moderate stability and accuracy, useful for many electronic devices. An [[avalanche diode]] displays a similar stable voltage over a range of current. The most stable diodes of this type are made by temperature-compensating a Zener diode by placing it in series with a forward diode; such diodes are made as two-terminal devices, e.g. the 1N821 series having an overall voltage drop of 6.2 V at 7.5 mA, but are also sometimes included in integrated circuits.

The most common voltage reference circuit used in integrated circuits is the [[bandgap voltage reference]]. A [[bandgap]]-based reference (commonly just called a 'bandgap') uses analog circuits to add a multiple of the voltage difference between two bipolar junctions biased at different current densities to the voltage developed across a diode. The diode voltage has a negative temperature coefficient (i.e. it decreases with increasing temperature), and the junction voltage difference has a positive temperature coefficient. When added in the proportion required to make these coefficients cancel out, the resultant constant value is a voltage equal to the bandgap voltage of the semiconductor. In [[silicon]], this is approximately 1.25V. [[Zener diode#Subsurface_Zeners|Buried-Zener references]] can provide even lower noise levels, but require higher operating voltages which are not available in many battery-operated devices.

==Gas filled devices==
[[Gas filled tube]]s and [[neon lamp]]s have also been used as voltage references, primarily in tube-based equipment, as the voltage needed to sustain the [[gas discharge]] is comparatively constant.  For example, the popular RCA 991&lt;ref name=&quot;RCA991&quot;&gt;RCA 991 Voltage Regulator tube [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/049/9/991.pdf data sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Voltage regulator tube]]&quot; is an NE-16 [[neon lamp]] which fires at 87 Volts and then holds 48&amp;ndash;67 Volts across the discharge path.

'''Vintage amateur radio''' is a subset of [[amateur radio]] activity, considered a form of [[nostalgia]] or hobby much like antique car collecting, where enthusiasts collect, restore, preserve, build, and operate amateur radio equipment from bygone years, most notably those using [[vacuum tube]] technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haring&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Haring|first=Kristen |title=Ham radio's technical culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2ly7rDKeGZsC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=Kristen+Haring+vintage&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MOccTBqB-_AG-qKwtww&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 19, 2010|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-08355-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular modes of operation include voice communication using [[amplitude modulation]] (AM), and [[Morse code]] using [[continuous wave]] (CW) [[radiotelegraphy]]. Among enthusiasts, there is considerable interest in owning, restoring and operating vintage military and commercial radio equipment, much of it more than 40 years old. Some undertake to construct their own gear, known in ham slang as [[Amateur radio homebrew|homebrewing]], using vintage parts and designs. A number of amateur radio clubs and organizations sponsor contests, events, and swap meets that cater to this specialized aspect of the hobby.

== Appeal ==
Many amateurs prefer the relatively precise digital frequency displays and stability of modern, state-of-the-art, [[microprocessor]] based amateur radios. Vintage radio enthusiasts contend that modern amateur equipment lacks the aesthetic appeal and &quot;soul&quot; of amateur electronic gear from the vacuum tube era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virhistory.com/ham/rrab.faq.htm#why |title=Why Boatanchors? by John Brewer WB5OAU |publisher=Virhistory.com |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many find satisfaction in taking commercially-made amateur equipment from the 1930s-1970s (affectionately called [[Boat anchor (metaphor)|boat anchor]]s by US amateurs&lt;ref name=&quot;Boatanchors FAQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ac6v.com/73.htm#ba |title=Origins Of Hamspeak |publisher=Ac6v.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of their large size and weight) and carefully restoring it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haring&quot; /&gt;

[[File:N3wwl.ogg|thumb|right|Audio recording of voice transmission by amateur station N3WWL using vacuum tube gear]]
Enthusiasts feel that the spacious electrical and mechanical designs of boat anchor radios are more easily worked on than the miniaturized layouts of modern Japanese gear. Fixing a modern transceiver often involves nothing more than a [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI chip]] replacement. Vintage amateur radio devotees enjoy the more primitive experience that boat anchor radios offer, calling it &quot;real radio&quot;. Enthusiasts claim that boat anchors sound better than modern equipment, saying that the [[Valve sound|tube audio]] from vintage gear is &quot;warmer&quot; and more aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boatanchors FAQ&quot;&gt;[http://www.virhistory.com/ham/rrab.faq.htm Boatanchors FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Some hobbyists see vintage radio operation as a valuable asset to help preserve the history and heritage of radio for future generations, and may assist in the restoration and operation of vintage radio equipment for historical exhibits, museums and museum ships.

== AM activity ==
[[File:Wb6acu.png|thumb|left|&quot;AM'er&quot; [[Joe Walsh]] WB6ACU on the air]]
[[File:WB6ACU.ogg|thumb|left| Audio recording of Joe Walsh on the air]]
Amplitude modulation (AM) was once the main voice mode in amateur radio before being superseded by [[Single-sideband modulation]] (SSB). But AM has recently become a nostalgic specialty interest on the [[shortwave]] ham bands. Vintage radio operation has drawn a wide range of amateur radio enthusiasts from rock star [[Joe Walsh]], WB6ACU, to former [[Federal Communications Commission]] attorney Riley Hollingsworth, K4ZDH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eham.net/articles/2970, &quot;Hollingsworth Era&quot; of Amateur Enforcement Enters Fourth Year &quot;&quot;I am proud of the Amateur Service.&quot; Riley Hollingsworth, K4ZDH, at home in his well-equipped basement ham shack. Hollingsworth's gear includes several &quot;vintage&quot; operating positions.&quot; Source: The ARRL Letter Vol. 20, No. 49 December 14, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;
A majority of &quot;AM'ers&quot; stations consist of vintage transmitters and receivers housed in separate cabinets. Some operators have even obtained old [[AM broadcast]] transmitters from radio stations that have upgraded their equipment. Others build their equipment from scratch (called [[Amateur radio homebrew|homebrewing]]) using both modern and vintage-era components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioworld.com/article/3760 |title=Radio World Online |publisher=Radioworld.com |date=2001-06-20 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, shortwave [[High frequency|HF]] [[frequencies]] (in [[Hertz|MHz]]) on which amateur radio AM activity can be found include ''1.885, 1.930, 1.985, 3.870-3.885, 7.290-7.295, 7.160, 14.286, 14.330, 21.425, and 29.000-29.200,'' and sometimes feature &quot;special event&quot; stations using unique [[call sign]]s. In the United Kingdom, AM activity can be found almost every day on frequencies between ''3.615'' and ''3.625'' MHz. The French AM activity can be found almost every day the morning between 6h30 and 8h00 the frequency ''3.550'' MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Bande des 80 mètres|AM activity frequency ''3.550'' MHz]]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversations ([[Q code|QSO's]] in ham [[slang]]) are typically configured as &quot;roundtables&quot; consisting of several participants. Interested newcomers are usually encouraged to switch their modern [[transceiver]]s to AM mode, introduce themselves, and join the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/tis/info/pdf/9302043.pdf ARRL QST article: Classic Rigs And Amplitude Modulation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classic gear ==
[[File:Johnson Viking Ranger transmitter-02.png|thumb|right|EF Johnson Viking Ranger transmitter, circa 1958]]
[[File:Atlas210x.png|thumb|left|Atlas 215X solid state [[transceiver]] circa 1977]]
Vintage operating activity is not limited to the AM mode. Many devotees use their &quot;classic&quot; amateur gear from vintage-era American manufacturers like [[Eico]], [[E.F. Johnson Company|EF Johnson]], [[National Radio Company|National]], [[Heathkit]], [[Hammarlund]], [[R. L. Drake Company|Drake]], [[Collins Radio|Collins]], [[World Radio Laboratories|WRL]], [[Swan electronics|Swan]], [[Signal/One]], [[Lafayette Radio|Lafayette]] and [[Hallicrafters]], to make radiotelegraphy (CW), [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]], [[frequency modulation|FM]] and [[RTTY]] two-way contacts. Although 1930s through 1970s gear is considered &quot;vintage&quot;, collectors may differ on the cutoff dates.

Some even sub-specialize in [[military radio]] collecting and undertake to restore and operate surplus communications equipment, much of it dating back to [[World War II]], from the ubiquitous [[United States Army Signal Corps|US Signal Corps]] [[SCR-300]] and [[SCR-536]] [[walkie talkie]]s to exotic gear like the British [[Paraset]], a small [[espionage]] transceiver supplied to Resistance forces in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.

[[File:Eddystone.png|thumb|left|Eddystone EC10 shortwave receiver circa 1967]]
There is considerable interest in vintage military and commercial radio equipment among [[European Union|EU]] amateur radio operators, especially gear from British manufacturers such as [[Marconi Company|Marconi]], [[Racal]], [[Eddystone Radio|Eddystone]], [[Pye Ltd.|Pye]], and a variety of Russian, German, Canadian, British [[RAF]] and [[British Army]] equipment, such as the well known [[Wireless Set No. 19]].

=== Glowbugs ===
[[File:Ai2q.png|thumb|right|upright|Glowbug transmitter hand built by AI2Q]]
&quot;Glowbugs&quot; are a related aspect of vintage radio and harken back to the early days of amateur radio, when the majority of hams hand-crafted their own equipment. Smaller in size than &quot;boat anchors&quot;, &quot;glowbug&quot; is a term used by US amateurs to describe a simple home-made tube-type radio set, reminiscent of the shortwave radio-building craze of the 1920s and 30s. &quot;Glow&quot; refers to the glow of the vacuum tubes and &quot;bug&quot; to the gear's relatively diminutive size. The Doerle [[Regenerative circuit|regenerative]] receiver and [[Hartley oscillator|Hartley]] transmitter circuits are considered &quot;classic&quot; glowbug designs. Generally, any small, home-built tube-type transmitter or receiver may be referred to as a glowbug. The majority of glowbug transmitters are designed to be used in the CW radiotelegraphy mode.

As late as the 1960s, glowbugs were part of many beginner ham stations, and the ARRL Radio Amateur Handbook for those years exhibited a number of such simple, tube-based designs. Today, glowbug operators are enjoying a resurgence of interest among [[QRP operation|QRP]] enthusiasts and others with a penchant for constructing their own equipment. Many hams are assembling &quot;glowbug rigs&quot; on improvised chassis such as tin cakepans and wooden boards, and putting them on the air between 7040 – 7050&amp;nbsp;kHz and 7114 – 7125&amp;nbsp;kHz. Amateur radio Glowbug enthusiasts can often be heard communicating on the shortwave bands via CW using [[Morse code]]. Popular frequencies to hear glowbug contacts are around 3560&amp;nbsp;kHz and also 3579.5&amp;nbsp;kHz, chosen because [[crystal oscillator|crystals]] for this frequency can be salvaged from discarded color TV sets, along with other transmitter components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.make-digital.com/make/vol09/?pg=141&amp;search=tv+set+color+burst+crystals&amp;u1=texterity&amp;cookies=1 |title='&amp;#39;TV Set Salvage'&amp;#39; by ThomasArey |publisher=Make-digital.com |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webhome.idirect.com/~griffith/gb.htm |title=Glowbugs resources |publisher=Webhome.idirect.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clubs, events, and publications ==

Those accustomed to making repairs on [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain ''potentially lethal voltages''. The practice of discharging power-supply [[capacitors]] and keeping one hand in your pocket when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis to one side of the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station [[ground connection]] to all equipment is encouraged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boatanchors FAQ&quot;/&gt; Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bob Cooke, VE3BDB |url=http://www.qsl.net/ve3bdb/hazards.html |title=Danger!

A '''suppressor grid''' is a  grid used in a [[thermionic valve]] (also called [[vacuum tube]]) to suppress [[secondary emission]]. A suppressor grid is also called the antidynatron grid, as it helps to reduce the [[dynatron]] effect.

== Placement ==

In its simplest form, a suppressor grid, typically of coarse structure, is interposed between the [[screen grid]] and the [[anode]] ([[Plate electrode|plate]]) of a [[tetrode]], turning it into a [[pentode]].

== Electrical connection of grid ==

The suppressor grid is usually connected to the cathode and more often than not, this connection is made within the glass envelope. Because the grid is negatively charged relative to both the anode and the screen grid, it repels any secondary electrons back to the anode preventing them from contributing to the screen grid current, and to any [[negative resistance]] characteristic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5223">[[File:GU50.JPG|thumb|right|GU-50 produced in 1977 at the Ulianovsk factory]]
The '''GU-50''' (Russian: '''ГУ-50''') is a power [[pentode]] [[vacuum tube]] intended for 50 watt operation as a linear [[Radio frequency|RF]] amplifier on frequencies up to 120 [[MHz]].  It is in fact a Soviet-produced copy of the [[Telefunken]] '''LS-50''' power pentode, possibly reverse-engineered from German ([[Wehrmacht]]) military radios captured during [[World War II]], or based on documentation, machines and materials captured as a trophy.  It is one of the more unusual types of tube because of its non-standard 8-pin base and a metal &quot;cap&quot; (not connected to any of the tube internal elements) with a plastic &quot;handle&quot; on top of the envelope - which is meant to ease extracting the tube from its socket (especially when the tube is hot). One stock Russian-produced socket includes a rugged die-cast metal cage-like enclosure for the tube with spring-loaded locking lid. (The cap was made for fixation of the tube in the metal can, since tubes were designed for mobile operations). Another stock Russian-produced socket is stamped of light aluminium sheet metal, without a lid on top.

In the past the tube was very popular with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Eastern European]] [[amateur radio]] operators because it was commonly available (from military and government warehouses) and could produce fairly large amounts of output power using relatively simple designs. Also, it was popular in Soviet era DIY audio amplifiers for hi-fi and musical instruments. GU-50 tubes were used also in early TV sets as a horizontal sweep output stage, and in medical devices as RF generators. The tube was never used in mass production amplifiers for civil usage because of relatively expensive technology and materials used.

Although the tube was not originally designed for the purpose, recently{{when|date=January 2011}} some [[valve sound]] enthusiasts have used the GU-50 in [[hi-fi]] tube audio, both in [[Single-Ended Triode|single-ended triode]] and [[push-pull amplifier]] designs. 

During the Soviet years the tube was produced by one of the major Soviet transmitting-tube manufacturers in the city of [[Ulianovsk]]. It was also made in Poland, in the Unitra factory. At this time it is unclear if current production of the tube exists; however, large quantities of New Old Stock (NOS) GU-50s appear to be available in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the type is far more readily found than the original LS-50. 

GU-50 was not alone. There were other successors of LS-50 designed by Telefunken. Switzerland's BBC produced P50/1 and later modified version P50/2. They had the same base and pinout as the original LS-50. German Democratic Republic made a P50 that had the same bulb as Soviet ГУ-50.  Later RFT made a P50-1 version of their tube. Unlike Soviet TV designers that used stock military GU-50 for their first TV sets, Eastern German manufacturers offered P50-2 especially made for TV horizontal sweep duties. There were also versions with simplified bulbs made for civil usage, but internals were still too expensive to compete with civil tubes like rugged clones of RCA 6L6 and especially designed later sweep tubes like EL500. The Western German version was called FL152 (or, with 6.3 volts heater, EL152); Eastern German version was called SRS552N. 

The tube, despite its European popularity, was not well known in U.S.A. and Canada until audiophiles rediscovered it after the collapse of Eastern political block and Soviet Union.

The Chinese version of this tube is called FU-50 and production still continues, probably by Shuguang, the major Chinese tube builder.

[[Image:Traveling wave tube diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.9|Diagram of helix TWT]]

==Description==

===Basic TWT===
The TWT is an elongated vacuum tube with an [[electron gun]] (a heated [[cathode]] that emits [[electron]]s) at one end. A [[voltage]] applied across the cathode and [[anode]] accelerates the electrons towards the far end of the tube, and an external magnetic field around the tube focuses the electrons into a beam. At the other end of the tube the electrons strike the &quot;collector&quot;, which returns them to the circuit.

Wrapped around the inside of the tube, just outside the beam path, is a helix of wire, typically [[oxygen-free copper]]. The RF signal to be amplified is fed into the helix at a point near the emitter end of the tube. The signal is normally fed into the helix via a [[waveguide]] or electromagnetic coil placed at one end, forming a one-way signal path, a [[directional coupler]].

By controlling the accelerating voltage, the speed of the electrons flowing down the tube is set to be similar to the speed of the RF signal running down the helix. The signal in the wire causes a magnetic field to be induced in the center of the helix, where the electrons are flowing. Depending on the phase of the signal, the electrons will either be sped up or slowed down as they pass the windings. This causes the electron beam to &quot;bunch up&quot;, known technically as &quot;velocity modulation&quot;. The resulting pattern of electron density in the beam is an analog of the original RF signal.

Because the beam is passing the helix as it travels, and that signal varies, it causes induction in the helix, amplifying the original signal. By the time it reaches the other end of the tube, this process has had time to deposit considerable energy back into the helix. A second directional coupler, positioned near the collector, receives an amplified version of the input signal from the far end of the RF circuit. Attenuators placed along the RF circuit prevent the reflected wave from traveling back to the cathode.

Higher powered Helix TWTs usually contain [[beryllium oxide]] ceramic as both a helix support rod and in some cases, as an electron collector for the TWT because of its special electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties.&lt;ref&gt;1997 Industrial Assessment of the Microwave Power Tube Industry - US Department of Defense [http://www.triodeel.com/images/tubeassessment.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanberyllia.com/tech_info1.html Beryllium Oxide Properties]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison===
[[Image:Uv 1008 1976.jpg|thumb|Soviet UV-1008 (УВ-1008) TWT from 1976, with waveguide input and output]]

There are a number of RF amplifier tubes that operate in a similar fashion to the TWT, known collectively as velocity-modulated tubes. The best known example is the [[klystron]]. All of these tubes use the same basic &quot;bunching&quot; of electrons to provide the amplification process, and differ largely in what process causes the velocity modulation to occur.

In the klystron, the electron beam passes through a hole in a resonant cavity which is connected to the source RF signal. The signal at the instant the electrons pass through the hole causes them to be accelerated (or decelerated). After this the faster electrons overtake the slower ones, causing the density to rise. This process ends when the mutual repulsion between the electrons causes the velocity to average out. This takes time to complete as the electrons drift down the tube, leading to their alternate name &quot;drift tubes&quot;.

In comparison, in the TWT the acceleration is caused by the interactions with the helix along the entire length of the tube. This allows the TWT to have a very low noise output, a major advantage of the design. More usefully, this process is much less sensitive to the physical arrangement of the tube, which allows the TWT to operate over a wider variety of frequencies. TWT's are generally at an advantage when low noise and frequency variability are useful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radartutorial.eu/08.transmitters/Traveling%20Wave%20Tube.en.html &quot;Traveling Wave Tube&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radartutorial.eu/18.explanations/ex19.en.html &quot;Velocity-modulated Tubes&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coupled-cavity TWT===
Helix TWTs are limited in peak RF power by the current handling (and therefore thickness) of the helix wire. As power level increases, the wire can overheat and cause the helix geometry to warp. Wire thickness can be increased to improve matters, but if the wire is too thick it becomes impossible to obtain the required [[helix|helix pitch]] for proper operation. Typically helix TWTs achieve less than 2.5&amp;nbsp;kW output power.

The '''coupled-cavity TWT''' overcomes this limit by replacing the helix with a series of coupled cavities arranged axially along the beam. This structure provides a helical [[waveguide]], and hence amplification can occur via velocity modulation. Helical waveguides have very nonlinear dispersion and thus are only narrowband (but wider than [[klystron]]). A coupled-cavity TWT can achieve 60&amp;nbsp;kW output power.

Operation is similar to that of a [[klystron]], except that coupled-cavity TWTs are designed with attenuation between the slow-wave structure instead of a drift tube. The slow-wave structure gives the TWT its wide bandwidth. A [[free electron laser]] allows higher frequencies.

==Traveling-wave-tube amplifier==
A TWT integrated with a regulated [[power supply]] and protection circuits is referred to as a traveling-wave-tube amplifier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vsats: Very Small Aperture Terminals|author=John Everett|publisher=IET|year=1992|isbn=0-86341-200-9|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MWuXmf4V4NwC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=twta+power-supply+protection+control&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=KmiMR5uEKozitQPomLHQBQ&amp;sig=D15Vi396wr6gRWzB1o3JtBiUF1I#PPA64,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated '''TWTA''' and often pronounced &quot;TWEET-uh&quot;). It is used to produce high-power [[radio frequency]] signals. The bandwidth of a broadband TWTA can be as high as one [[Octave (electronics)|octave]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} although tuned (narrowband) versions exist; operating frequencies range from 300&amp;nbsp;MHz to 50&amp;nbsp;GHz.

A TWTA consists of a traveling-wave tube coupled with its protection circuits (as in [[klystron]]) and regulated [[power supply]] [[Active power conditioner|Electronic Power Conditioner]] (EPC),&lt;!--Unsure if active is correct--&gt; which may be supplied and integrated by a different manufacturer. The main difference between most power supplies and those for vacuum tubes is that efficient vacuum tubes have depressed collectors to recycle kinetic energy of the electrons, so the secondary winding of the power supply needs up to 6 taps of which the helix voltage needs precise regulation. The subsequent addition of a [[linear]]izer (as for [[inductive output tube]]) can, by complementary compensation, improve the [[gain compression]] and other characteristics of the TWTA; this combination is called a linearized TWTA (LTWTA, &quot;EL-tweet-uh&quot;).

Broadband TWTAs generally use a helix TWT, and achieve less than 2.5&amp;nbsp;kW output power. TWTAs using a coupled cavity TWT can achieve 15&amp;nbsp;kW output power, but at the expense of bandwidth.

==Invention, development and early use==
The original design and prototype of the TWT was done by Andrei &quot;Andy&quot; Haeff c. 1931 while he was working as a doctoral student at the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory at Caltech.  His original patent, &quot;Device for and Method of Controlling High Frequency Currents&quot;, was filed in 1933 and granted in 1936.&lt;ref name=Haeff_patent&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2064469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ieee_spectrum&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Jack|last1=Copeland|first2=Andre A.|last2=Haeff|title=The True History of the Traveling Wave Tube|journal=IEEE Spectrum| date=September 2015 |pages=38-43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the TWT is often attributed to [[Rudolf Kompfner]] in 1942–1943.  In addition, Nils Lindenblad, working at RCA (Radio Corporation of America) in the USA also filed a patent for a device in May 1940&lt;ref name=Lindenblad_patent&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2300052}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was remarkably similar to Kompfner's TWT.&lt;ref name=Gilmour_book&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Artech House|isbn=978-0-890-06720-8|last=Gilmour|first=A.

By the 1950s, after further development at the [[Electron Technologies, Inc.#History|Electron Tube Laboratory]] at Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City, California, TWTs went into production there, and by the 1960s TWTs were also produced by such companies as the [[e2v|English Electric Valve Company]], followed by [[Ferranti]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firedirect.net/Profiles/0802_e2v/0802_001.htm Fire Direct Web site].

On July 10, 1962, the first communications satellite, [[Telstar|Telstar 1]], was launched with a 2&amp;nbsp;W, 4&amp;nbsp;GHz RCA-designed TWT transponder used for transmitting RF signals to Earth stations.

==Uses==
TWTAs are commonly used as amplifiers in [[satellite]] [[transponders]], where the input signal is very weak and the output needs to be high power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Satellite Communications|author=Dennis Roddy|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2006|isbn=0-07-146298-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2KEt_hFyjwgC&amp;pg=PA374&amp;dq=twta&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=sGSMR4aGJovUsgOd-J3QBQ&amp;sig=ke5M82C-Y32_MVDtufLwcjOijas#PPA375,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TWTA whose output drives an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] is a type of [[transmitter]]. TWTA transmitters are used extensively in [[radar]], particularly in airborne [[fire-control radar]] systems, and in [[electronic warfare]] and self-protection systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Microwave Tube Transmitters|author=L. Sivan|publisher=Springer|year=1994|isbn=0-412-57950-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o2o1R7I8rvEC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=twta-transmitter&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=rmWMR-iNMobuswPAjZnQBQ&amp;sig=esPHAaN0vD7w-2vxXxCbXJI0u7o#PPA20,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such applications, a control grid is typically introduced between the TWT's electron gun and slow-wave structure to allow pulsed operation. The circuit that drives the control grid is usually referred to as a grid [[modulator]].

Another major use of TWTAs is for the [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) testing industry for immunity testing of electronic devices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

TWTAs can often be found in older (pre-1995) aviation SSR microwave [[Transponder (aviation)|transponders]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

'''Tube sockets''' are [[Electrical connector|electrical sockets]] into which [[vacuum tube]]s (also known as valves) can be plugged, holding them in place and providing terminals, which can be soldered into the circuit, for each of the pins. Sockets are designed to allow tubes to be plugged in in only one orientation. They were used in all tube electronic equipment to allow tubes, which failed relatively frequently, to be quickly tested and replaced. In the day of tube radio and television it was common in the US for local [[drug store]]s to have vacuum [[tube tester]]s, and sell replacement tubes.

Throughout the tube era, as technology developed, sometimes differently in different parts of the world, many tube bases and sockets came into use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Tube sockets were typically mounted in holes on a sheet metal chassis and wires or other components were hand [[solder]]ed to lugs on the underside of the socket. In the 1950s, [[printed circuit board]]s were introduced and tube sockets were developed whose contacts could be soldered directly to the printed wiring tracks. Looking at the bottom of a socket, or, equivalently, a tube from its bottom, the pins were numbered clockwise, starting at an index notch or gap, a convention that has persisted into the [[integrated circuit]] era.

In the 1930s, tubes often had the connection to the [[control grid]] brought out through a metal [[top cap]] on the top of the tube. This was connected by using a clip with an attached wire lead. An example would be the 6A7 [[pentagrid converter]]. Later, some tubes, particularly those used as radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers or horizontal deflection amplifiers in TV sets, such as the 6DQ6, had the plate or [[anode]] lead protrude through the envelope. In both cases this allowed the tube's output circuitry to be isolated from the input (grid) circuit more effectively. In the case of the tubes with the plate brought out to a cap, this also allowed the plate to run at higher voltages (over 26,000 volts in the case of rectifiers for colour television, such as the 3A3, as well as high-voltage regulator tubes.) A few unusual tubes had caps for both grid and plate; the caps were symmetrically placed, with divergent axes.

==The first tubes==
The earliest tubes, like the ''Deforest Spherical [[Audion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Howard|title=Deforest Spherical Audion|url=http://www.stonevintageradio.com/description.php?II=97&amp;UID=20130720104245|work=Stone Vintage Radio Museum|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from c. 1911, used the typical light bulb Edison socket for the heater, and flying leads for the other elements. Other tubes directly used flying leads for all of their contacts, like the ''Cunningham AudioTron'' from 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Howard|title=Cunningham Tubular Audio Tron|url=http://www.stonevintageradio.com/description.php?II=170&amp;UID=20130720104245|work=Stone Vintage Radio Museum|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Deforest Oscillion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Howard|title=Deforest Oscillion 250 W Transmitting Tube|url=http://www.stonevintageradio.com/description.php?II=542&amp;UID=20130720104247|work=Stone Vintage Radio Museum|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type C6A xenon thyratrons, used in servos for the U.S. Navy Stable Element (vertical gyro) Mark 6, had a mogul screw base and L-shaped stiff wires at the top for grid and anode connections. Mating connectors were machined pairs of brass blocks with clamping screws, attached to flying leads.

==Early bases==
When tubes became more widespread, and new electrodes were added, more connections were required. Specially designed bases were created to account for this need. However, as the world was suffering from [[World War I]], and the new electronics technology was just emerging, designs were far from being standardized. Usually, each company had their own tubes and sockets, which were not interchangeable with tubes from other companies. By the early 1920s, this situation was finally changing, and several standard bases were created. They consisted of a base (ceramic, metal, bakelite, etc.) with a number of prongs ranging from 3 to 7, with either a non regular distribution or with one or two of the prongs of bigger diameter than the other, so that the tube could only be inserted in a certain position. Sometimes they relied on a bayonet on the side of the base. Examples of these are the very common USA bases UX4, UV4, UY5 and UX6, and the European B5, B6, B7, B8, C7, G8A, etc. Tubes in the USA typically had from 4 to 7 pins in a circular array, with adjacent pairs of larger pins for heater connections.

Before AC line/mains-powered radios were developed, some 4-pin tubes (in particular, the very common UX-201A ('01A)) had a bayonet pin on the side of a cylindrical base. The socket used that pin for retaining the tube; insertion finished with a slight clockwise turn. Leaf springs, essentially all in the same plane, pressed upward on the bottoms of the pins, also keeping the bayonet pin engaged.

The first hot-cathode CRT, the Western Electric 224-B, had a standard 4-pin bayonet base, and the bayonet pin was a live connection. (Five effective pins: It was an electrostatic-deflection gas-focused type, with a diode gun and single-ended deflection. The anode and the other two plates were common.)&lt;!-- Ref.: Rider's Encyclopedia on C.R. Oscilloscopes and Their Uses; sorry; I'm exhausted! --&gt;

An early exception to these types of bases is the Peanut 215, which instead of using prongs had a tiny bayonet base with 4 drop-like contacts. Another exception is the European Side Contact series commonly known as P, which instead of using a prong, relied on side contacts at 90 degrees from the tube axis with 4 to 12 contacts.

==Octal {{anchor|Octal base}} ==
[[File:6P3S.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An octal base tube, Russian 6Π3C, similar to the [[6L6]].]]
In 1935, [[RCA]] introduced a new type of tube base for their new metal envelope tubes, which they called an ''octal base''. As the name implies it had eight pins&amp;mdash;more than were usually used previously. Octal bases, as defined in IEC 60067,&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60067: &quot;Dimensions of electronic tubes and valves. IEC dimensions&quot; (1966). Also published as BS 448-1:1981.&lt;/ref&gt; diagram IEC 67-I-5a, have a 45 degree angle between pins, which form a {{convert|17.45|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} diameter circle around a {{convert|7.82|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} diameter keyed post (sometimes called a ''spigot'') in the center. Octal sockets were designed to accept octal tubes, the rib in the keyed post fitting an indexing slot in the socket so the tube could only be inserted in one orientation.

When used on metal tubes, pin 1 was always reserved for a connection to the metal shell, which was usually grounded for shielding purposes. The octal base soon caught on for glass tubes, where the large central post could also house and protect the &quot;[[evacuation tip]]&quot; of the glass tube. The eight available pins allowed more complex tubes than before, such as dual triodes, to be constructed. The glass envelope of an octal base tube was cemented into a [[bakelite]] or plastic base with a hollow post in the center, surrounded by eight metal pins. The wire leads from the tube were soldered into the pins, and the seal-off tip through which the air was evacuated from the envelope was protected inside the post.

Matching plugs were also manufactured that let tube sockets be used as 8-pin [[electrical connector]]s; penurious experimenters would sometimes salvage the base from a discarded tube for this purpose. Octal sockets were used to mount other components, particularly [[electrolytic capacitor]] assemblies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmid|first=Kurt|title=R-390A plug-in multi-section electrolytic capacitor kit|url=http://www.schmid-mainz.de/elco.pdf|work=Schmid-Mainz|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and electrical [[relay]]s; octal-mount relays are still common.&lt;ref&gt;A socket similar to the standard otcal but with 11 pins also exists, and is also called &quot;octal&quot;. It is an industry standard, developed mainly for industrial 3-phase relays (3PDT or TPDT) in order to accommodate three changeover contacts. It was also used in some older power supplies but was never used for tubes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octal and miniature tubes are still in use in tube-type audio [[hi fi]] and [[guitar amplifier]]s.

Most octal tubes following the widespread European designation system have penultimate digit &quot;3&quot; as in ECC34 (full details in the [[Mullard-Philips tube designation]] article). There is a different, totally obsolete, pre-world-war-II German octal type.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Loctal==
[[File:Heksoda i trioda UCH21.jpeg|thumb|upright|A loctal-base tube]]
A variant of the octal base, the B8G '''loctal base''' or ''lock-in'' base (sometimes spelled &quot;loktal&quot; – trademarked by Sylvania), was developed by Sylvania for ruggedized applications such as automobile radios. Along with B8B (a British designation out of date by 1958), these 8-pin locking bases are almost identical and the names usually taken as interchangeable (although there are some minor differences in specifications, such as spigot material and spigot taper, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Staff of 'Wireless World'|title=Radio Valve Datas|date=1958|publisher=Iliffe $ Sons Ltd|location=London|page=87|edition=Sixth|chapter=Explanation of Valve-Base Connections}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pin geometry was the same as for octal, but the pins were thinner (although they will fit into a standard octal socket, they wobble and do not make good contact), the base shell was made of aluminium, and the center hole had an electrical contact that also mechanically locked (hence &quot;loctal&quot;) the tube in place. Loctal tubes were only used widely by a few equipment manufacturers, most notably Philco, which used the tubes in many table radios. Loctal tubes have a small indexing mark on the side of the base skirt; they do not release easily from their sockets unless pushed from that side. Because the pins are actually the [[Fernico]] or [[Cunife]] lead-out wires from the tube itself, they are prone to intermittent connections caused by the build-up of electrolytic corrosion products due to the pin being of a different metallic composition to the socket contact.

The loctal tube's structure was supported directly by the connecting pins passing through the glass &quot;button&quot; base. Octal tube structures were supported on a glass &quot;pinch&quot;, formed by heating the bottom of the envelope to fusing temperature, then squeezing the pinch closed. Sealing the pinch embedded the connecting wires in the pinch's glass and gave a vacuum-tight seal. The connecting wires then passed through the hollow base pins, where they were soldered to make permanent connections.

Loctal tubes had shorter connecting lengths between the socket pins and the internal elements than did their octal counterparts. This allowed them to operate at higher frequencies than octal tubes. The advent of miniature &quot;all-glass&quot; 7- and 9-pin tubes overtook both octals and loctals, so the loctal's higher-frequency potential was never fully exploited.

Loctal tube type numbers in the USA typically begin with &quot;7&quot; (for 6.3-volt types) or &quot;14&quot; for 12.6-volt types. This was fudged by specifying the heater voltage as ''nominally'' 7 or 14 volts so that the tube nomenclature fitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sylvania Type 7A8|url=http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/108/7/7A8.pdf|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battery types (mostly 1.4-volt) are coded &quot;1Lxn&quot;, where ''x'' is a letter and &quot;n&quot; a number, such as &quot;1LA4&quot;. Russian loctals ''end'' in L, e.g. 6J1L. European designations are ambiguous; all B8G loctals have numbers either in the range:
* 20–29, (such as EF22) except for early tubes in the series: DAC21, DBC21, DCH21, DF21, DF22, DL21, DLL21, DM21 which have either B9G or octal bases, the change to Sylvania's locktal standard coming in 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DAC21|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_dac21.html|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* or 50–59 (special bases, including the European 9-pin lock-in base), but other types are in the same range (e.g. while EF51 is B8G loctal, the EF55 is 9-pin loctal, B9G, and the EL51 has a side-contact P8A base).

===Other loctals===
* 9-pin loctal bases, B9G, include the 1938 Philips [[EF50]], EL60 and some type numbers in the European 20–29 and 50–59 range;
* There is a different &quot;loctal Lorenz&quot; in the [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]] &lt;!--COMMENT (B8D, given numbers in the 70–79 range?)--&gt;.

==Miniature tubes==
[[File:12AU7.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of 12AU7As showing both triodes.]]
Efforts to introduce small tubes into the marketplace date back to the 1920s when experimenters and hobbyists made radios with so-called '''peanut tubes'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonevintageradio.com/images/573.jpg Photo of 1920s era peanut tube.]&lt;/ref&gt; like the Peanut 215 mentioned above. But because of the primitive manufacturing techniques of the time, these tubes were too unreliable for commercial use.

RCA announced in &quot;Electronics&quot; magazine, new miniature tubes, which proved reliable. The first ones, such as the [[6J6]] VHF dual triode, were introduced in 1939. The bases commonly referred to as &quot;miniature&quot; are the 7-pin B7G type, and the slightly later 9-pin B9A (noval). The pins are arranged evenly in a circle of 8 or 10 evenly spaced positions, with one pin omitted; this allows the tube to be inserted in only one orientation. Keying by omitting a pin is also used in 8 (submin.), 10, and 12-pin (Compactron) tubes (a variant 10-pin form, &quot;noval+1&quot;, is basically a 9-pin socket with an added center contact).

As with loctal tubes, the pins of miniature tube are stiff wires protruding through the bottom of the glass envelope which plug directly into the socket. However, unlike all their predecessors, miniature tubes are not fitted with separate bases; the base is an integral part of the glass envelope. The pinched-off air evacuation nub is at the top of the tube, giving it its distinctive appearance. More than one functional section can be included in a single envelope; a dual triode configuration is particularly common. Seven- and nine-pin tubes were common, though miniature tubes with more pins, such as the [[Compactron]] series, were later introduced, and could fit up to three amplifying elements. Some miniature tube sockets had a skirt that mated with a cylindrical metal electrostatic shield that surrounded the tube, fitted with a spring to hold the tube in place if the equipment was subject to vibration. Sometimes the shield was also fitted with thermal contacts to transfer heat from the glass envelope to the shield and act as a [[heat sink]], which was considered to improve tube life in higher power applications.

Electrolytic effects from the differing metals used for the miniature tube pins (usually [[Cunife]] or [[Fernico]]) and the tube base could cause intermittent contact due to local corrosion, especially in relatively low current tubes such as were used in battery-operated radio sets. Malfunctioning equipment with miniature tubes can sometimes be brought back to life by removing and reinserting the tubes, disturbing the insulating layer of corrosion.

Miniature tubes were widely manufactured for military use during the second world war,&lt;ref name=sixj6&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aaa0399.htm The National Valve Museum: 6J6]&lt;/ref&gt; and also used in consumer equipment. The Sonora Radio and Television Corporation produced the first radio using these miniature tubes, the &quot;Candid&quot;, in April 1940.&lt;ref name=schiffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiffer|first=Michael Brian|title=The Portable Radio in American Life|year=1992|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0816512843|pages=123–125|url=http://www.amazon.com/Portable-Radio-American-Culture-Technology/dp/0816512841}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1940 RCA released its battery-operated '''Model BP-10''', the first [[superheterodyne]] receiver small enough to fit in a handbag or coat pocket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nostalgiaair.org/PagesByModel/428/M0015428.pdf Schematic of RCA Model BP-10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vintage-electronics.com/photos/1183.JPG Photo of RCA Model BP-10]&lt;/ref&gt;  This model had the following tube lineup:  '''1R5''' - Pentagrid Converter; '''1T4''' - I.F. Amplifier;  '''1S5''' - Detector/AVC/AF Amplifier;  '''1S4''' - Audio Output. The BP-10 proved so popular that Zenith, Motorola, Emerson, and other radio manufacturers produced similar pocket radios based on RCA's miniature tubes.&lt;ref name=&quot;schiffer&quot; /&gt; Several of these pocket radios were introduced in 1941 and sold until the suspension of radio production in April 1942 for the duration of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Miniature Radio Tubes|journal=Radio Age|date=April 1945|pages=19|url=http://www.vacuumtubeera.net/RadioAge-1945-04.pdf|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war miniature tubes continued to be manufactured for civilian use regardless of any technical advantage, as they were cheaper than octals and loctals.&lt;ref name=sixj6/&gt;

=== Miniature 7-pin base ===
The '''B7G''' (or &quot;'''small-button'''&quot; or &quot;'''heptal'''&quot;) 7-pin miniature tubes are smaller than noval, with 7 pins arranged at 45 degrees spacing in a 9.53&amp;nbsp;mm (3/8th inch) diameter arc, the &quot;missing&quot; pin position being used to position the tube in its socket (unlike octal, loctal and rimlock sockets). Examples include the 6AQ5/EL90 and 6BE6/EK90. European tubes of this type have numbers 90-99, 100-109, 190-199, 900-999. A few in 100-109 have unusual non-B7G bases (e.g., Wehrmacht base).

=== Noval base ===
The 9-pin miniature '''Noval''' B9A base (sometimes called button 9-pin, B9-1) offered a useful reduction in physical size compared to previous common types such as octal (especially important in TV sets where space was limited), while also providing a sufficient number of connections (unlike B7G) to allow effectively unrestricted access to all the electrodes even of relatively complex tubes such as double triodes and triode-hexodes. It could also provide multiple connections to an electrode of a simpler device where useful, e.g. 4 connections to the grid of a conventional grounded-grid UHF triode (e.g. 6AM4) to minimise the deleterious effects of lead inductance on the high-frequency performance.

This base type was used by many of the [[United States]] and most of the European tubes (e.g. [[12AX7]], [[EF86]], [[EL84]]) produced commercially towards the end of the era before [[transistor]]s largely displaced their use.

The IEC 67-I-12a specification calls for a 36 degree angle between the 9 pins of 1.016&amp;nbsp;mm thickness, in an arc of diameter 11.89&amp;nbsp;mm.

European tubes of this type have numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 800-899, 8000-8999.

=== Duodecar base ===
The '''Duodecar''' B12C base (IEC 67-I-17a) has 12 pins in a 27&amp;nbsp;mm diameter circle and dates from 1961. It was also called the [[Compactron]] T-9 construction/E12-70 base&lt;ref&gt;Sylvania Receiving Tubes Technical Manual, 14th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally similar in form to a noval socket, but larger. In the center is a clearance hole for a tube evacuation pip, which is typically on the bottom of a Compactron tube. &lt;!-- also CRTs, fairly sure. Regards, user:nikevich --&gt; (It should not be confused with the similar-sounding but differently sized '''Duodecal''' B12A base.)

=== Rimlock base ===
The '''Rimlock''' (B8A) base is an 8-pin design with a pin circle diameter close to noval, and uses a nub on the side of the envelope to engage with a guide and retaining spring in the socket wall. This provides pin registration (since the pins are equi-spaced) and also a fair degree of retention. Early tubes with this base type typically had a metal skirt around the lower ~15mm of the envelope to match the socket wall, and this offered a degree of built-in screening, but these were fairly soon replaced by 'skirtless' versions which had a characteristic widening in the glass to compensate physically for the absence of the skirt. In the European naming scheme, rimlock tubes are numbered in the ranges 40-49, 110-119 (with exceptions), and 400-499, e.g. EF40. Although virtually unknown elsewhere, this was a very common base type in European radios of the late 1940s through the 1950s, but was eventually displaced by the ubiquitous B7G and noval (B9A) base types.

==UHF tubes==
[[File:AcornTubeSockets.agr.jpg|thumb|upright|A box of Acorn sockets.]]
By 1935 new tube technologies were required for the development of radar and telecommunications. [[UHF]] requirements severely limited the existing tubes, so radical ideas were implemented which affected how these tubes connected to the host system. Two new bases appeared, the [[955 acorn triode|acorn tube]] and the lighthouse tube, both solving the same problems but with different approaches. Thompson, G.M. Rose, Saltzberg and Burnside from RCA created the acorn tube by using far smaller electrodes, with radial short connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Electron Tubes|year=1994|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-9051991451|page=27|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VHFyngmO95YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Sōgo Okamura}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different approach was taken by the designers of the lighthouse tube, such as the octal-base [[2C43]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/pdfs/2c43.pdf 2C43 data sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; which relied on using concentric cylindrical metal contacts in connections that minimized inductance, thus allowing a much higher frequency.

[[Nuvistor]]s were very small, reducing stray capacitances and lead inductances. The base and socket were so compact that they were widely used in UHF TV tuners. They could also be used in small-signal applications at lower frequencies, as in the [[Ampex]] MR-70, a costly studio tape recorder whose entire electronics section was based on nuvistors.

==Other socket styles==
There are many other socket types, of which a few are:
* '''Decal''' B10B base (IEC 67-I-41a) 10 pins with 1.02&amp;nbsp;mm diameter in an 11.89&amp;nbsp;mm diameter circle, e.g. PFL200
* '''Decar''' B10G base (IEC E10-73) A 10th pin added to the center of a standard 9-pin miniature base, e.g. 6C9
* '''Magnoval''' B9D base (IEC 67-I-36a) 9 pins with 1.27&amp;nbsp;mm diameter in a 17.45&amp;nbsp;mm pin circle diameter arc, e.g. EL503, EL509, PD500, etc. - not to be confused with...
* '''Novar''' B9E base, 9 pins with 1.02&amp;nbsp;mm diameter in a 17.45&amp;nbsp;mm pin circle diameter arc, one of several Compactron types, which looks similar to Magnoval (but a Novar tube in a Magnoval socket will not make good pin contect, and a Magnoval tube in a Novar socket may damage the socket).
* '''Neo Eightar''' base (IEC 67-I-31a) 8 pins in a 15.24&amp;nbsp;mm diameter circle
* 5-pin sub-miniature wire-ended B5A base (no socket used; e.g. EA76)

A remarkably wide variety of tube and similar sockets is listed and described, with some informal application notes, at a commercial site, Pacific T.V.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pacifictv.ca/socket.htm&lt;/ref&gt; including nuvistor, 8-pin subminiature, vidicon, reflex klystron, nine-pin octal-like, 10-pin miniature (two types), 11-pin sub-magnal, diheptal 14-pin, and many display tubes such as Nixies and vacuum fluorescent types (and even more). As well, each socket has a link to a clear, high-quality picture. &lt;!-- I'm not keen on offering commercial sites, but this is seriously exceptional! I'm a 75-year-old retired lifetime electronic tech, and several of the tube sockets, much less exotica such as 20-pin relay sockets (iirc!) were new to me. Regards, user:nikevich --&gt;

Some subminiature tubes with flexible wire leads all exiting in the same plane were connected by subminiature inline sockets. &lt;!-- No luck with a Google image search -- user:nikevich - Does the EA76 fit this description?--&gt;

Some low-power [[reflex klystron]]s such as the 2K25 and 2K45 had small-diameter rigid coaxial outputs parallel to octal base pins. To accommodate the coax, one contact was replaced by a clearance hole.

Vacuum tubes for high-power applications often required custom socket designs. A jumbo four-prong socket was used for various industrial tubes. A specialized 7-pin socket (Septar or B7A) with all pins in a circle with one pin wider than the others was used for transmitting tubes. Subminiature tubes with long wire leads, introduced in the 1950s, were often soldered directly to printed circuit boards. Sockets were made for early [[transistor]]s, but quickly fell out of favor as transistor reliability became established. This also happened with early integrated circuits; IC sockets later became used only for devices that may need to be upgraded.

{{memory types}}

The '''Selectron''' was an early form of digital [[computer memory]] developed by [[Jan A. Rajchman]] and his group at the [[Radio Corporation of America]] under the direction of [[Vladimir Zworykin]].  It was a [[vacuum tube]] that stored digital data as electrostatic charges using technology similar to the [[Williams tube]] storage device.  The team was never able to produce a commercially viable form of Selectron before [[core memory]] became almost universal, and it remains practically unknown today.

== Development ==
Development of Selectron started in 1946 at the behest of [[John von Neumann]] of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]],&lt;ref&gt;Metropolis N, Rajchman, JA (1980) Early Research on Computers at RCA ''A History of Computing in the Twentieth Century'' pp 465-469, ISBN 0-12-491650-3&lt;/ref&gt; who was in the midst of designing the [[IAS machine]] and was looking for a new form of high-speed memory. RCA responded with the Selectron with a capacity of 4096 bits, with a planned production of 200 by the end of the year. They found the device to be much more difficult to build than expected, and they were still not available by the middle of 1948. As development dragged on, the IAS machine was forced to switch to [[Williams tube]]s for storage, and the primary customer for Selectron disappeared.

RCA continued work on the concept, re-designing it for a smaller 256-bit capacity. The 256-bit Selectron was projected to cost about $500 each when in full production. While they were more reliable and faster than the Williams tube, that cost and the lack of availability, meant they were used only in one computer: the RAND Corporation's [[JOHNNIAC]].&lt;ref&gt;Greuenberger JF (1968) [http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM5654/ ''The History of the JOHNNIAC''] pp 25-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Selectron and the Williams tube were superseded in the market by the more compact and cost effective [[magnetic core memory]], in the early 1950s.

==Principle of operation==
===Electrostatic storage===
The [[Williams tube]] was an example of a general class of [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) devices known as [[storage tube]]s. 

The primary function of a conventional CRT is to display an image by lighting [[phosphor]] using a beam of [[electron]]s fired at it from an [[electron gun]] at the back of the tube. The beam is steered around the front of the tube though the use of deflection magnets or electrostatic plates.

Storage tubes were based on CRTs, sometimes unmodified. They relied on two normally undesirable principles of [[phosphor]] used in the tubes. One was that when electrons from the CRT's [[electron gun]] struck the phosphor to light it, some of the electrons &quot;stuck&quot; to the tube and caused a localized [[Static electricity|static electric]] charge to build up. The second was that the phosphor, like many materials, also released new electrons when struck by an electron beam, a process known as [[secondary emission]].{{sfn|Knoll &amp; Kazan|1952|p=1}}

Secondary emission had the useful feature that the rate of electron release was significantly non-linear. When a voltage was applied that crossed a certain threshold, the rate of emission increased dramatically. This caused the lit spot to rapidly decay, which also caused any stuck electrons to be released as well. Visual systems used this process to erase the display, causing any stored pattern to rapidly fade. For computer uses it was the rapid release of the stuck charge that allowed it to be used for storage.

In the [[Williams tube]], the [[electron gun]] at the back of an otherwise typical CRT is used to deposit a series of small patterns representing a 1 or 0 on the phosphor in a grid representing memory locations. To read the display, the beam scanned the tube again, this time set to a voltage very close to that of the secondary emission threshold. The patterns were selected to bias the tube very slightly positive or negative. When the stored static electricity was added to the voltage of the beam, the total voltage either crossed the secondary emission threshold or didn't. If it crossed the threshold, a burst of electrons was released as the dot decayed. This burst was read capacitively on a metal plate placed just in front of the display side of the tube.{{sfn|Eckert|1998|pp=19-20}}

There were four general classes of storage tubes; the &quot;surface redistribution type&quot; represented by the Williams tube, the &quot;barrier grid&quot; system which was unsuccessfully commercialized by [[RCA]] as the [[Radicon tube]], the &quot;sticking potential&quot; type which was not used commercially, and the &quot;holding beam&quot; concept, of which the Selectron is a specific example.{{sfn|Eckert|1998|p=18}}

===Holding beam concept===
In the most basic implementation, the holding beam tube uses three electron guns; one for writing, one for reading, and a third &quot;holding gun&quot; that maintains the pattern. The general operation is very similar to the Williams tube in concept. The main difference was the holding gun, which fired continually and unfocussed so it covered the entire storage area on the phosphor. This caused the phosphor to be continually charged to a selected voltage, somewhat below that of the secondary emission threshold.{{sfn|Eckert|1998|p=21}}

Writing was accomplished by firing the writing gun at low voltage in a fashion similar to the Williams tube, adding a further voltage to the phosphor. Thus the storage pattern was the slight difference between two voltages stored on the tube, typically only a few tens of volts different.{{sfn|Eckert|1998|p=21}} In comparison, the Williams tube used much higher voltages, producing a pattern that could only be stored for a short period before it decayed below readability.

Reading was accomplished by scanning the reading gun across the storage area. This gun was set to a voltage that would cross the secondary emission threshold for the entire display. If the scanned area held the holding gun potential a certain number of electrons would be released, if it held the writing gun potential the number would be higher. The electrons were read on a grid of fine wires placed behind the display, making the system entirely self-contained - the Williams tube's read plate was in front of the tube, and required continual mechanical adjustment to work properly.{{sfn|Eckert|1998|p=21}} The grid also had the advantage of breaking the display into spots without requiring the tight focus of the Williams system.

General operation was the same as the Williams system, but the holding concept had two major advantages. One was that it operated at much lower voltage differences and was thus able to safely store data for a longer period of time. The other was that the same deflection magnet drivers could be sent to several electron guns to produce a single larger device with no increase in complexity of the electronics.

== Design ==
The Selectron further modified the basic holding gun concept through the use of individual metal eyelets that were used to store additional charge in a more predictable and long-lasting fashion.

Unlike a CRT where the electron gun is a single point source consisting of a filament and single charged accelerator, in the Selectron the &quot;gun&quot; is a plate and the accelerator is a grid of wires (thus borrowing some design notes from the barrier-grid tube). Switching circuits allow voltages to be applied to the wires to turn them on or off. When the gun fires through the eyelets, it is slightly defocussed. Some of the electrons strike the eyelet and deposit a charge on it.

The original 4096-bit Selectron&lt;ref&gt;Rajchman JA, (1947) [http://www.rcaselectron.com/MTAC1947Raj.pdf &quot;The Selectron - A Tube for Selective Electrostatic Storage&quot;], ''Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation'', '''2''' (20):359-361&lt;/ref&gt; was a {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-long}} by {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[vacuum tube]] configured as 1024 by 4 bits.  It had an indirectly heated [[cathode]] running up the middle, surrounded by two separate sets of wires—one radial, one axial—forming a cylindrical grid array, and finally a dielectric storage material coating on the inside of four segments of an enclosing metal cylinder, called the ''signal plates''.  The bits were stored as discrete regions of charge on the smooth surface of the signal plates.

The two sets of orthogonal grid wires were normally &quot;biased&quot; slightly positive, so that the [[electrons]] from the cathode could flow through the grid and reach the dielectric. The continuous flow of electrons allowed the stored charge to be continuously regenerated by the [[secondary emission]] of electrons. To select a bit to be read from or written to, all but two adjacent wires on each of the two grids were biased negative, allowing current to flow to the dielectric at one location only.

[[Image:Selectron256Xsection.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Selectron cross section]]

Writing was accomplished by selecting a bit, as above, and then sending a pulse of potential, either positive or negative, to the signal plate. With a bit selected, electrons would be pulled onto (with a positive potential) or pushed from (negative potential) the dielectric. When the bias on the grid was dropped, the electrons were trapped on the dielectric as a spot of static electricity.

To read from the device, a bit location was selected and a pulse sent from the cathode. If the dielectric for that bit contained a charge, the electrons would be pushed off the dielectric and read as a brief pulse of current in the signal plate. No such pulse meant that the dielectric must not have held a charge.

The smaller capacity 256-bit (128 by 2 bits) &quot;production&quot; device&lt;ref&gt;Rajchman JA (1951) &quot;The Selective Electrostatic Storage Tube&quot;, ''RCA Review'' '''12''' (1):53-97&lt;/ref&gt; was in a similar vacuum-tube envelope. It was built with two storage arrays of discrete &quot;eyelets&quot; on a rectangular plate, separated by a row of eight cathodes. The pin count was reduced from 44 for the 4096-bit device down to 31 pins and two coaxial signal output connectors.  This version included visible green phosphors in each eyelet so that the bit status could also be read by eye.

[[Image:Backward wave oscillator.jpg|thumb|Miniature O-type backward-wave oscillator tube produced by Varian in 1956.  It could be voltage-tuned over an 8.2 - 12.4 GHz range and required a supply voltage of 600V.]]

[[File:Backward-wave Oszillator-Stockholm.jpg|thumb|Backward wave oscillator at Stockholm University operating in the Terahertz range]]
A '''backward wave oscillator''' ('''BWO'''), also called '''carcinotron''' (a trade name for tubes manufactured by [[Thomson-CSF|CSF]], now [[Thales Group|Thales]]) or '''backward wave tube''', is a [[vacuum tube]] that is used to generate [[microwaves]] up to the [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] range. It belongs to the [[traveling-wave tube]] family. It is an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] with a wide electronic tuning range.

An [[electron gun]] generates an [[electron beam]] that is interacting with a slow-wave structure. It sustains the [[oscillation]]s by propagating a traveling wave backwards against the beam. The generated [[electromagnetic wave]] power has its [[group velocity]] directed oppositely to the direction of motion of the electrons. The output power is coupled out near the electron gun.

It has two main subtypes, the '''M-type'''  ('''M-BWO'''), the most powerful,  and the '''O-type''' ('''O-BWO'''). The output [[Power (physics)|power]] of the O-type is typically in the range of 1 [[Watt|mW]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;GHz to 50&amp;nbsp;mW at 200 [[Hertz|GHz]]. Carcinotrons are used as powerful and stable microwave sources. Due to the good quality [[wavefront]] they produce (see below), they find use as illuminators in [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] imaging.

The backward wave oscillators were demonstrated in 1951, '''M-type''' by [[Bernard Epsztein]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{citeref patent|country=FR|number= 1035379 |inventor=Bernard Epsztein|pubdate=1959-03-31|title=Backward flow travelling wave devices|status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and '''O-type''' by [[Rudolf Kompfner]]. The M-type BWO is a voltage-controlled non-resonant extrapolation of [[magnetron]] interaction, both types are tunable over a wide range of frequencies by varying the accelerating [[voltage]]. They can be swept through the band fast enough to be appearing to radiate over all the band at once, which makes them suitable for effective [[radar jamming]], quickly tuning into the radar frequency. Carcinotrons allowed airborne radar jammers to be highly effective. However, [[frequency-agile]] [[radar]]s can hop frequencies fast enough to force the jammer to use [[barrage jamming]], diluting its output power over a wide band and significantly impairing its efficiency.

Carcinotrons are used in research, civilian and military applications. For example, the Czechoslovak air defense detection systems [[Kopac passive sensor]] and [[Ramona passive sensor]] employed carcinotrons in their receiver systems.

== The slow-wave structure ==
[[Image:Space-harmonics.svg|thumb|250px|(a) Forward fundamental space harmonic (n=0),
(b) Backward fundamental]]

The needed slow-wave structures must support a [[radio frequency]] (RF) electric field with a longitudinal component; the structures are periodic in the direction of the beam and behave like microwave filters with passbands and stopbands. Due to the periodicity of the geometry, the fields are identical from cell to cell except for a constant phase shift Φ.
This phase shift, a purely real number in a passband of a lossless structure, varies with frequency.
According to Floquet's theorem (see [[Floquet theory]]), the RF electric field E(z,t) can be described at an [[angular frequency]] ω, by a sum of an infinity of &quot;spatial or space harmonics&quot; E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

:E(z,t) =&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} {E_n}e^{j({\omega}t-{k_n}z)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[wavenumber|wave number]] or propagation constant k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of each harmonic is expressed as:

k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = (Φ + 2nπ) / p   (-π &lt; Φ &lt; +п)

z being the direction of propagation, p the pitch of the circuit and n an integer.

Two examples of slow-wave circuit characteristics are shown, in the ω-k or [[Léon Brillouin|Brillouin]] diagram:

* on figure (a), the fundamental n=0 is a forward space harmonic (the [[phase velocity]] v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=ω/k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; has the same sign as the [[group velocity]] v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;=dω/dk&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), synchronism condition for backward interaction is at point B, intersection of the line of slope v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; - the beam velocity - with the first backward (n = -1) space harmonic,
* on figure (b) the fundamental (n=0) is backward

A periodic structure can support both forward and backward space harmonics, which are not modes of the field, and cannot exist independently, even if a beam can be coupled to only one of them.

As the magnitude of the space harmonics decreases rapidly when the value of n is large, the interaction can be significant only with the fundamental or the first space harmonic.

== M-type BWO ==
[[Image:M-bwo.svg|thumb|250px|Schematic of an M-BWO]]
The '''M-type carcinotron''', or '''M-type backward wave oscillator''', uses crossed static electric field E and [[magnetic field]] B, similar to the [[magnetron]], for focussing an electron sheet beam drifting perpendicularly to E and B, along a slow-wave circuit, with a velocity E/B. Strong interaction occurs when the [[phase velocity]] of one space harmonic of the wave is equal to the electron velocity. Both E&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; components of the RF field are involved in the interaction (E&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; parallel to the static E field). Electrons which are in a decelerating E&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; electric field of the slow-wave, lose the [[potential energy]] they have in the static electric field E and reach the circuit. The sole electrode is more negative than the cathode, in order to avoid collecting those electrons having gained energy while interacting with the slow-wave space harmonic.

== O-type BWO ==
The '''O-type carcinotron''', or '''O-type backward wave oscillator''', uses an electron beam  longitudinally focused by a magnetic field, and a slow-wave circuit interacting with the beam. A collector collects the beam at the end of the tube.

===O-BWO spectral purity and noise ===
The BWO is a voltage tunable oscillator, whose voltage tuning rate is directly related to the propagation characteristics of the circuit. The oscillation starts at a frequency where the wave propagating on the circuit is synchronous with the slow space charge wave of the beam. Inherently the BWO is more sensitive than other oscillators to external fluctuations. Nevertheless, its ability to be phase- or frequency-locked has been demonstrated, leading to successful operation as a heterodyne local oscillator.

==== Frequency stability ====
The frequency–voltage sensitivity, is given by the relation

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;f/f = 1/2 [1/(1 + |v&lt;sub&gt;Φ&lt;/sub&gt;/v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;|)] (&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)
The oscillation frequency is also sensitive to the beam current (called &quot;frequency pushing&quot;). The current fluctuations at low frequencies are mainly due to the anode voltage supply, and the sensitivity to the anode voltage is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;f/f = 3/4 [ω&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;/ω/(1 + |v&lt;sub&gt;Φ&lt;/sub&gt;/v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;|)] (&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;)

This sensitivity as compared to the cathode voltage sensitivity, is reduced by the ratio ω&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;/ω, where ω&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; is the angular plasma frequency; this ratio is of the order of a few times 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==== Noise ====
Measurements on submillimeter-wave BWO's (de Graauw et al., 1978) have shown that a signal-to-noise ratio of 120&amp;nbsp;dB per MHz could be expected in this wavelength range. In heterodyne detection using a BWO as a local oscillator, this figure corresponds to a [[noise temperature]] added by the oscillator of only 1000–3000&amp;nbsp;K.

In [[vacuum tube]] technology, '''HT''' or '''high tension''' describes the main power supply to the circuit, which produces the current between [[anode]] and [[cathode]]. It is also known as the '''plate''' supply or voltage, [[B battery]] supply, or simply labeled '''-&gt;B''' on [[circuit diagram]]s, from the days of [[battery (vacuum tube)|battery powered circuitry]].

'''EHT''' or '''extra high tension''' similarly describes the accelerating voltage for a [[cathode ray tube]] such as used in a [[television]], [[computer monitor]] or [[cathode ray oscilloscope]].

The HT supply circuit most commonly provides a [[Electrical polarity|positive]] voltage of some hundreds of volts to the anode (or ''plate'') and in later circuits also to the [[screen grid]], with the cathode running at near ground or chassis potential. The main exception to this was in the case of tubes with water-cooled anodes, once used for [[radio transmission]], [[electric furnace]]s and similar applications. These tubes used a negative HT supply to the cathode, so that the anode could run near ground DC potential (but typically at many hundreds of volts of [[radio frequency|RF]]).

Other power supplies to vacuum tube circuits include:

* LT, ''low tension'' or ''[[Battery (vacuum tube)#A battery|A battery]]'', the supply to the [[Heating element|filaments]] or heaters.  Early tubes designed for battery operation had 2&amp;nbsp;volt filaments (for use with a [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid]] cell).  Later tubes had 1.4&amp;nbsp;volt filaments to run from [[Zinc–carbon battery|dry batteries]].  With the introduction of mains powered equipment, indirectly heated tubes became more common and usually (though not always) required 4&amp;nbsp;volts in Europe and 6.3&amp;nbsp;volts in America.  The latter became the standard voltage after the [[Second world war]].  One notable exception was that rectifier tubes often had 5 volt filaments or heaters which usually had to have a separate supply anyway.
* GB, ''[[grid bias]]'' or ''[[Battery (vacuum tube)#C battery|C battery]]''. Used in early battery powered equipment. Once self biasing circuits were developed, this power source was no longer required.
* EHT or ''Extra High Tension'', the accelerator supply to a [[cathode ray tube]]. This supply typically ranges from 15 kV to 35 kV though very early television receivers used voltages as low as 4&amp;nbsp;kV.

==Typical circuits==

===HT===
[[Image:VacRect2E.png|thumb|100px|Typical HT supply circuit schematic]]
The HT supply was usually obtained from a full wave rectifier circuit similar to the one shown.  In those sets that had no mains transformer (the so-called [[AC/DC receiver design|AC/DC]] design), the HT was obtained directly from the mains supply, either with a simple half wave rectifier or with a [[voltage doubler]] circuit.

===EHT===
In very early vacuum tube [[television set]]s, the EHT was derived directly from a high voltage winding on the mains transformer using a half wave recitifier.  In later television sets, the EHT supply was invariably generated by rectifying the flyback pulses from the scanning circuitry rather than directly from the mains supply (a practice that survived the transition to transistor circuits).  Although this provided a greater degree of safety, the reason for the change was that the mains transformer had been eliminated from sets produced from the 1940s onwards.

In [[vacuum tube]] trechnology, a '''top cap''' is a terminal at the top of the tube envelope that connects one of the electrodes, the other electrodes being connected via the [[tube socket]].

Top caps have most commonly been used for:

* Amplifier or similar tube [[control grid]] connection, to provide greater circuit stability by isolating the low-signal circuit from the rest of the tube connections.

* [[Anode]] connection, to isolate the [[HT (vacuum tube)|high-tension]] circuit, allowing higher voltages to be used.

* Physical convenience. Grid top caps on frequency converters could be connected directly to an adjacent coil; Anode top caps on output tubes could be connected by ''flying leads'' directly to an output transformer. Shorter leads generally mean greater stability.  

A few amplifier tubes used two top caps, symmetrically placed, one for anode and the other for grid.

[[File:866 mercury rectifier 1.jpeg|thumb|100px|866 mercury rectifier with anode top cap]]

In audio amplifier tube application, the top cap was originally used for the grid connection, and a serviceman could apply a moist finger to the terminal to confirm that the stage and subsequent circuits were working by listening for the hum this produced in the loudspeaker. This practice led to some nasty accidents when anode top caps were first introduced to amplifier stages (they had been used on rectifiers for some time).

'''Electron-stimulated luminescence''' (ESL) is [[light]] produced by [[cathodoluminescence]],&lt;ref name=&quot;engadget_vu1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Vu1 Corporation sees bright future for ESL light bulbs -- Engadget |url=http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/17/vu1-corporation-sees-bright-future-for-esl-light-bulbs/}} 100902 engadget.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;physorg_esl&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Company Claims ESLs to be the Future of Light Bulbs (w/ Video) |url=http://www.physorg.com/news172341986.html}} 100902 physorg.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;necnet_com-8301-17938_105-10354160-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Are ESL bulbs better than CFL or LED? – Crave - CNET |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10354160-1.html}} 100902 news.cnet.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenprophet.com/2012/03/esl-cfl-mercury-lights/ greenprophet.com - Are ESLs A Mercury-Free Replacement for CFL Lights? &amp;#124; Green Prophet] (2012-03-12).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--
 --&gt;i.e. by a beam of [[electron]]s made to hit a [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[phosphor]] surface. This is also the method used to produce light in a [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), but, unlike CRTs, ESL lamps do not include [[Magnetic deflection|magnetic]] or [[Electrostatic deflection|electrostatic]] means to deflect the electron beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/the-promise-of-a-better-light-bulb/ |work=The New York Times |title=The Promise of a Better Light Bulb? |date=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A cathodoluminescent light has a transparent glass envelope coated on the inside with a light-emitting phosphor layer. Electrons emitted from a cathode strike the phosphor; the current returns through a transparent conductive coating on the envelope. The phosphor layer emits light through the transparent face of the envelope. The system has a power supply providing at least 5kVDC to the light emitting device, and the electrons transiting from cathode to anode are essentially unfocused. Additional circuits allow [[TRIAC|triac]]-type [[dimmer]]s to control the light level.&lt;ref&gt;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7834553.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7834553&amp;RS=PN/7834553&lt;/ref&gt; Lights produced so far have a [[color rendering index]] of 90. The energy consumption can be 70% less than that of a standard [[incandescent light bulb]]. Claimed lifetime can be as long as 10,000 hours which is more than ten times that of a standard incandescent light bulb.&lt;ref name=&quot;popsci_fluorescent_bulb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Newest Lightbulb Tech Combines Advantages of Incandescent, Fluorescent, and LED |url=http://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2009-09/better-energy-efficient-light-bulb}} 100902 popsci.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[fluorescent lamp]]s, which produce light through the electrical excitation of [[Mercury-vapor lamp|mercury vapor]]&lt;!--[This article about ESL, not fluorescent lamps:] which in turn radiates UV light towards a phosphor layer that converts the light into the visible spectrum--&gt;, ESL lamps do not use [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=&quot;Will ESL Light Bulbs Beat LEDs?&quot; |url=http://blogs.forbes.com/eco-nomics/2010/11/22/will-esl-light-bulbs-beat-leds/?boxes=Homepagechannels |work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially available ESL product was a reflector bulb. 

Drawbacks include high weight, a slightly larger-than-normal base and –&amp;nbsp;as with [[compact fluorescent lamps]]&amp;nbsp;– when switched on, a slight delay before illumination begins and a static charge which attracts dust to the bulb face. As of 2015 the efficiency is roughly half that of commercially available LED bulbs, although it is considerably better than that of traditional incandescent lamps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diylife.com/2011/01/26/esl-light-bulbs-diy-product-review/&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacuum tubes mostly rely on [[thermionic emission]] of electrons from a hot [[electrical filament|filament]] or a [[hot cathode|cathode]] heated by the filament. This type is called a '''thermionic tube''' or '''thermionic valve'''. A [[phototube]], however, achieves electron emission through the [[photoelectric effect]]. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); [[gas-filled tube]]s are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to [[electric discharge in gases]], usually without a heater.

The simplest vacuum tube, the [[diode]], contains only a heater, a heated electron-emitting cathode (the filament itself  acts as the cathode in some diodes), and a plate (anode). Current can only flow in one direction through the device between the two electrodes, as electrons emitted by the cathode travel through the tube and are collected by the anode. Adding one or more [[control grid]]s within the tube allows the current between the cathode and anode to be controlled by the voltage on the grid or grids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoddeson|first=L|title=The Vacuum Tube|url=http://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/events/vacuumt.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Tubes with grids can be used for many purposes, including  [[Amplifier|amplification]], [[Rectifier|rectification]], [[Electronic switch|switching]], [[Electronic oscillator|oscillation]], and [[Cathode ray tube|display]].

Invented in 1904 by [[John Ambrose Fleming]], vacuum tubes were a basic component for electronics throughout the first half of the twentieth century,  which saw the diffusion of  radio, television, radar, [[Sound reinforcement system|sound reinforcement]], [[sound recording and reproduction]], large [[telephone]] networks, analog and digital [[computers]], and industrial [[process control]].
Although some applications had counterparts using earlier technologies such as the [[spark gap transmitter]] or [[mechanical computer]]s, it was the invention of the vacuum tube that made these technologies widespread and practical.
In the 1940s the invention of [[semiconductor]] devices made it possible to produce [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] devices, which are smaller, more efficient, more reliable, more durable, and cheaper than tubes.
Hence, from the mid-1950s solid-state devices such as [[transistor]]s gradually replaced tubes. The [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) remained the basis for televisions and video monitors until superseded in the 21st century. However, there are still a few applications for which tubes are preferred to semiconductors; for example, the [[magnetron]] used in microwave ovens, and certain high frequency amplifiers.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}&lt;!--4 levels of headings makes TOC too deep --&gt;

==Classifications==
One classification of vacuum tubes is by the number of active electrodes, (neglecting the filament or heater). A device with two active elements  is a [[diode]], usually used for [[Rectifier|rectification]]. Devices with three elements are [[triode]]s used for amplification and switching. Additional electrodes create [[tetrode]]s, [[pentode]]s, and so forth, which have multiple additional functions made possible by the additional controllable electrodes.

Other classifications are:
* by frequency range ([[audio frequency|audio]], radio, [[VHF]], [[UHF]], [[microwave]])
* by power rating (small-signal, audio power, high-power radio transmitting)
* by [[Hot cathode|cathode/filament]] type (indirectly heated, directly heated) and [[Antique radio#Warm-up time|Warm-up time]] (including &quot;bright-emitter&quot; or &quot;dull-emitter&quot;)
* by characteristic curves design (e.g., sharp- versus remote-[[Cut-off (electronics)#Valves|cutoff]] in some pentodes)
* by application (receiving tubes, transmitting tubes, amplifying or switching, rectification, mixing)
* specialized parameters (long life, very low [[Microphonics|microphonic sensitivity]] and low noise audio amplification, rugged/military versions
* specialized functions (light or radiation detectors, video imaging tubes)
* tubes used to display [[information]] ([[Nixie tube]]s, [[Magic eye tube|&quot;magic eye&quot; tubes]], [[Vacuum fluorescent displays]], [[Cathode ray tube|CRTs]]

Multiple classifications may apply to a device; for example similar dual triodes can be used for audio preamplification and as [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s in computers, although linearity is important in the former case and long life in the latter.

Tubes have different functions, such as [[cathode ray tube]]s which create a beam of electrons for display purposes (such as the television picture tube) in addition to more specialized functions such as [[electron microscopy]] and [[electron beam lithography]]. [[X-ray tube]]s are also vacuum tubes. [[Phototube]]s and [[photomultiplier]]s rely on electron flow through a vacuum, though in those cases electron emission from the cathode depends on energy from [[photon]]s rather than [[thermionic emission]]. Since these sorts of &quot;vacuum tubes&quot; have functions other than electronic amplification and rectification they are described in their own articles.

A vacuum tube consists of two or more [[electrode]]s in a vacuum inside an airtight enclosure. Most tubes have glass envelopes, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. On most tubes, the leads, in the form of pins, plug into a [[tube socket]] for easy replacement of the tube (tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves). Some tubes had an electrode terminating at a top cap. The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Jones, ''Valve Amplifiers'', p. 580, Elsevier, 2012 ISBN 0080966403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Olsen, ''Electronics: A General Introduction for the Non-Specialist'', p.391, Springer, 2013 ISBN 1489965351.&lt;/ref&gt; The bases were commonly made with [[phenolic insulation]] which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a top cap include reduced grid to anode capacitance,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, D.C., [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5258684 &quot;Triode amplifiers in the frequency range 100 Mc/s to 420 Mc/s &quot;], ''Journal of the British Institution of Radio Engineers'', vol. 11, iss. 12, pp. 569-575, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SxNKAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22A+top+cap+is+used+to+reduce+the+anode-to-grid+capacitance%22 p.571]&lt;/ref&gt; improved high-frequency performance, keeping a very high plate voltage away from lower voltages, and accommodating one more electrode than allowed by the base. There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections.

The earliest vacuum tubes evolved from [[incandescent light bulb]]s, containing a [[electrical filament|filament]] [[glass-to-metal seal|sealed]] in an evacuated  glass envelope. When hot, the filament releases [[electron]]s into the vacuum, a process called [[thermionic emission]]. A second electrode, the [[anode]] or ''plate'', will attract those electrons if it is at a more positive voltage. The result is a net flow of electrons from the filament to plate. However, electrons cannot flow in the reverse direction because the plate is not heated and does not emit electrons. The filament (''[[cathode]]'') has a dual function: it emits electrons when heated; and, together with the plate, it creates an electric field due to the potential difference between them. Such a tube with only two electrodes is termed a [[diode]], and is used for [[Rectifier|rectification]]. Since current can only pass in one direction, such a diode (or ''[[rectifier]]'') will convert alternating current (AC) to pulsating DC. This can therefore be used in a DC [[power supply]], and is also used as a [[demodulator]] of [[amplitude modulated]] (AM) radio signals and similar functions.

Early tubes used the directly heated filament as the cathode. Many more modern tubes employ indirect heating, with a separate electrically isolated &quot;heater&quot; inside a tubular cathode. The heater is not an electrode, but simply serves to heat the cathode sufficiently for [[thermionic emission]] of electrons. This allowed all the tubes to be heated through a common circuit (which can as well be AC) while allowing each cathode to arrive at a voltage independently of the others, removing an unwelcome constraint on circuit design.

The filaments require constant and often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the microwatt level. Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode slam into the anode (plate) and heat it; this can occur even in an idle amplifier due to quiescent currents necessary to ensure linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes are cooled by [[black-body radiation|radiation]] through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum envelope to conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually cooled by a blower.

[[Klystron]]s and [[cavity magnetron|magnetrons]] often operate their anodes (called '''collectors''' in klystrons) at ground potential to facilitate cooling, particularly with water, without high voltage insulation. These tubes instead operate with high negative voltages on the filament and cathode.

Except for diodes, additional electrodes are positioned between the cathode and the plate (anode). These electrodes are referred to as grids as they are not solid electrodes but sparse elements through which electrons can pass on their way to the plate. The vacuum tube is then known as a [[triode]], [[tetrode]], [[pentode]], etc., depending on the number of grids. A triode has three electrodes: the anode, cathode, and one grid, and so on. The first grid, known as the control grid, (and sometimes other grids) transforms the diode into a ''voltage-controlled device'': the voltage applied to the control grid affects the current between the cathode and the plate. When held negative with respect to the cathode, the control grid creates an electric field which repels electrons emitted by the cathode, thus reducing or even stopping the current between cathode and anode. As long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode, essentially no current flows into it, yet a change of several volts on the control grid is sufficient to make a large difference in the plate current, possibly changing the output by hundreds of volts (depending on the circuit). The solid-state device which operates most like the pentode tube is the [[junction field-effect transistor]] (JFET), although vacuum tubes typically operate at over a hundred volts, unlike most semiconductors in most applications.

==History and development==
[[Image:Edison effect bulb 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|One of Edison's experimental bulbs]]
The 19th century saw increasing research with evacuated tubes, such as the [[Geissler tube|Geissler]] and [[Crookes tube]]s. Famous scientists who experimented with such tubes included [[Thomas Edison]], [[Eugen Goldstein]], [[Nikola Tesla]], and [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] among many others. With the exception of early [[light bulb]]s, such tubes were only used in scientific research or as novelties. The groundwork laid by these scientists and inventors, however, was critical to the development of subsequent vacuum tube technology.

Although [[thermionic emission]] was originally reported in 1873 by [[Frederick Guthrie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick |last=Guthrie |authorlink=Frederick Guthrie |title=Magnetism and Electricity |date=1876 |location=London and Glasgow |publisher=William Collins, Sons, &amp; Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UuoDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;f=false}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was Thomas Edison's 1883 investigation that spurred future research, the phenomenon thus becoming known as the &quot;[[Edison effect]]&quot;. Edison patented what he found,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Edison {{US patent|307031}} &quot;Electrical Indicator&quot;, Issue date: 1884&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not understand the underlying physics, nor did he have an inkling of the potential value of the discovery. It wasn't until the early 20th century that the [[Rectifier|rectifying]] property of such a device was utilized, most notably by [[John Ambrose Fleming]], who used the [[diode]] tube to detect ([[demodulate]]) radio signals. [[Lee De Forest]]'s 1906 &quot;[[audion]]&quot; was also developed as a radio detector, and soon led to the development of the [[triode]] tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2012|title=The age of vacuum tubes: Early devices and the rise of radio communications|journal=IEEE Ind. Electron. M.|pages=41–43|doi=10.1109/MIE.2012.2182822|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was essentially the first electronic amplifier, leading to great improvements in telephony (such as the first coast-to-coast telephone line in the US) and revolutionizing the technology used in radio transmitters and receivers. The electronics revolution of the 20th century arguably began with the invention of the triode vacuum tube.

{{main|Diode}}
The English physicist [[John Ambrose Fleming]] worked as an engineering consultant for firms including Edison Telephone and the [[Marconi Company]]. In 1904, as a result of experiments conducted on Edison effect bulbs imported from the USA, he developed a device he called an &quot;oscillation valve&quot; (because it passes current in only one direction). The heated filament, or [[cathode]], was capable of [[thermionic emission]] of electrons that would flow to the ''[[Plate electrode|plate]]'' (or ''[[anode]]'') when it was at a higher voltage. Electrons, however, could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons.

Later known as the [[Fleming valve]], it could be used as a [[rectifier]] of alternating current and as a radio wave [[Detector (radio)|detector]]. This greatly improved the [[crystal set]] which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called [[cat's whisker]]. Unlike modern semiconductors, such a diode required painstaking adjustment of the contact to the crystal in order for it to rectify. The tube was relatively immune to vibration, and thus vastly superior on shipboard duty, particularly for navy ships with the shock of weapon fire commonly knocking the sensitive but delicate galena off its sensitive point (the tube was in general no more sensitive as a radio detector, but was adjustment free). The diode tube was a reliable alternative for detecting radio signals. Higher power diode tubes or ''power rectifiers'' found their way into power supply applications until they were eventually replaced by silicon rectifiers in the 1960s.

===Triodes===

[[File:Triode.PNG|thumb|upright|Triode symbol. From top to bottom: plate (anode), control grid, cathode, heater (filament)]]
Originally, the only use for tubes in radio circuits was for [[Rectifier|rectification]], not amplification. In 1906, [[Robert von Lieben]] filed for a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Robert von Lieben&amp;nbsp;— Patent Nr&amp;nbsp;179807 Dated November 19, 1906 | publisher = Kaiserliches Patentamt | date = 19 November 1906 | url = http://www.hts-homepage.de/Lieben/DRP179807.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[cathode ray tube]] which included magnetic deflection. This could be used for amplifying audio signals and was intended for use in telephony equipment. He would later go on to help refine the [[triode]] vacuum tube.

However, it was [[Lee De Forest]] who is credited with inventing the triode tube in 1907 while continuing experiments to improve his original [[Audion tube]], a crude forerunner of the triode. By placing an additional electrode between the filament ([[cathode]]) and [[plate electrode|plate]] (anode), he discovered the ability of the resulting device to amplify signals of all frequencies. As the voltage applied to the so-called [[control grid]] (or simply &quot;grid&quot;) was lowered from the cathode's voltage to somewhat more negative voltages, the amount of current from the filament to the plate would be reduced. The negative electrostatic field created by the grid in the vicinity of the cathode would inhibit [[thermionic emission]] and reduce the current to the plate. Thus, a few volts' difference at the grid would make a large change in the plate current and could lead to a much larger voltage change at the plate; the result was voltage and power [[amplifier|amplification]]. In 1907, De Forest filed for a patent&lt;ref&gt;Lee De Forest {{US patent|879532}} &quot;Space Telegraphy&quot;, Issue date: 18 February 1908&lt;/ref&gt; for such a three-electrode version of his original Audion tube for use as an electronic amplifier in radio communications. This eventually became known as the triode.

[[Image:General electric pliotron pp schenectady 3.jpg|thumb|upright|General Electric Company Pliotron, [http://www.chemheritage.org/ Chemical Heritage Foundation]]]
De Forest's device was not a ''hard vacuum'' tube, as he erroneously believed that it depended on the presence of residual gas remaining after evacuation. In its Audion leaflets, the De Forest company even warned against any operation which might lead to too high a vacuum.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In 1912 De Forest brought the audion to Harold Arnold in AT&amp;T's engineering department. Arnold recommended that AT&amp;T purchase the patent. He developed high-vacuum tubes which were tested in the summer of 1913 on AT&amp;T's long distance network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corp.att.com/attlabs/reputation/timeline/15tel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish inventor [[Eric Tigerstedt]] significantly improved on the original triode design in 1914, while working on his [[sound-on-film]] process in Berlin, Germany. Tigerstedt's innovation was to make the electrodes concentric cylinders with the cathode at the centre, thus greatly increasing the collection of emitted electrons at the anode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antti V. |last=Räisänen |first2=Arto |last2=Lehto |title=Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications |page=7 |publisher=Artech House |date=2003 |isbn=1580536697}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first true vacuum triodes in production were the Pliotrons developed by [[Irving Langmuir]] at the [[General Electric]] research laboratory ([[Schenectady, New York]]) in 1915.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Langmuir was one of the first scientists to realize that a harder vacuum would improve the amplifying behaviour of the triode, having improved Gaede's diffusion vacuum pump. Pliotrons were closely followed by the French type 'TM' and later the English type 'R' which were in widespread use by the allied military by 1916. These types were the first true hard vacuum tubes; early diodes and triodes performed as such despite a rather high residual gas pressure. Techniques to produce and maintain better vacua in tubes were then developed. Historically, vacuum levels in production vacuum tubes typically ranged from 10 [[Pascal (pressure)|µPa]] down to 10&amp;nbsp;nPa.

The triode and its derivatives (tetrodes and pentodes) are [[transconductance]] devices, in which the controlling signal applied to the grid is a ''voltage'', and the resulting amplified signal appearing at the anode is a ''current''. Compare this to the behavior of the [[bipolar junction transistor]], in which the controlling signal is a current and the output is also a current. For vacuum tubes, transconductance or mutual conductance (gm) is defined as the change in the plate(anode)/cathode current divided by the corresponding change in the grid/cathode voltage, with a constant plate(anode)/cathode voltage. Typical values of gm for a small-signal vacuum tube are 1 to 10 millisiemens. It is one of the three 'constants' of a vacuum tube, the other two being its gain μ and plate resistance R&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; or R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. The Van der Bijl equation defines their relationship as follows: &lt;math&gt;gm = {\mu \over R_p}&lt;/math&gt;

The non-linear operating characteristic of the triode caused early tube audio amplifiers to exhibit harmonic distortion at low volumes. Plotting plate current as a function of applied grid voltage, it was seen that there was a range of grid voltages for which the transfer characteristics were approximately linear. To use this range, a negative bias voltage had to be applied to the grid to position the [[direct current|DC]] operating point in the linear region. This was called the idle condition, and the plate current at this point the &quot;idle current&quot;. The controlling voltage was superimposed onto the bias voltage, resulting in a linear variation of plate current in response to both positive and negative variation of the input voltage around that point. This concept is called ''[[grid bias]]''. Many early radio sets had a third battery called the &quot;C battery&quot; (unrelated to the present-day [[C battery|C cell]]) whose positive terminal was connected to the cathode of the tubes (or &quot;ground&quot; in most circuits) and whose negative terminal supplied this bias voltage to the grids of the tubes. Later circuits, after tubes were made with heaters isolated from their cathodes, used [[cathode bias]]ing, avoiding the need for a separate negative power supply. However C batteries continued to be included in some equipment even when the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; batteries had been replaced by power from the AC mains. That was possible because there was essentially no current draw on these batteries; they could thus last for many years (often longer than all the tubes) without requiring replacement.

When triodes were first used in radio transmitters and receivers, it was found that tuned amplification stages had a tendency to oscillate unless their gain was very limited. This was due to the parasitic capacitance between the plate (the amplifier's output) and the control grid (the amplifier's input), known as the  [[Miller effect|Miller capacitance]]. Eventually the technique of ''neutralization'' was developed whereby the RF transformer connected to the plate (anode) would include an additional winding in the opposite phase. This winding would be connected back to the grid through a small capacitor, and when properly adjusted would cancel the Miller capacitance. This technique was employed and led to the success of the [[Neutrodyne]] radio during the 1920s.
However, neutralization required careful adjustment and proved unsatisfactory when used over a wide ranges of frequencies.

===Tetrodes and pentodes===
{{main|Tetrode|Pentode}}
[[File:Tetrode.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Tetrode symbol. From top to bottom: plate (anode), screen grid, control grid, cathode, heater (filament)]]
To combat the stability problems and limited voltage gain due to the [[Miller effect]], the physicist [[Walter H. Schottky]] invented the tetrode tube in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2012|title=The age of vacuum tubes: the conquest of analog communications|journal=IEEE Ind. Electron. M.|pages=52–54|doi=10.1109/MIE.2012.2193274|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that the addition of a second grid, located between the control grid and the plate (anode), known as the ''[[screen grid]]'', could solve these problems. (&quot;Screen&quot; in this case refers to electrical &quot;screening&quot; or shielding, not physical construction: all &quot;grid&quot; electrodes in between the cathode and plate are &quot;screens&quot; of some sort rather than solid electrodes since they must allow for the passage of electrons directly from the cathode to the plate). A positive voltage slightly lower than the plate (anode) voltage was applied to it, and was bypassed (for high frequencies) to ground with a capacitor. This arrangement decoupled the anode and the [[control grid]], essentially eliminating the Miller capacitance and its associated problems. Consequently, higher voltage gains from a single tube became possible, reducing the number of tubes required in many circuits. This two-grid tube is called a ''[[tetrode]]'', meaning four active electrodes, and was common by 1926.

[[File:Tetrode.png|thumb|right| At certain values of plate voltage and current, the tetrode characteristic curves are kinked due to secondary emission.]]
However, the tetrode had one new problem. In any tube, electrons strike the anode with sufficient energy to cause the emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this so-called [[secondary emission]] of electrons is not important since they are simply re-captured by the more positive anode (plate). But in a tetrode they can be captured by the screen grid (thus also acting as an anode) since it is also at a high voltage, thus robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the device. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons, in the worst case, particularly as the plate voltage dips below the screen voltage, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the so-called &quot;tetrode kink&quot; and is an example of [[negative resistance]] which can itself cause instability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjseymour.plus.com/elec/valves/valves.htm Introduction to Thermionic Valves (Vacuum Tubes)], Colin J. Seymour&lt;/ref&gt; The otherwise undesirable negative resistance was exploited to produce an extremely simple oscillator circuit only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant [[LC circuit]] to oscillate; this was effective over a wide frequency range. The so-called [[dynatron oscillator]] thus operated on the same principle of negative resistance as the [[tunnel diode]] oscillator many years later. Another undesirable consequence of secondary emission is that in extreme cases enough charge can flow to the screen grid to overheat and destroy it. Later tetrodes had anodes treated to reduce secondary emission; earlier ones such as the type 77 sharp-cutoff pentode connected as a tetrode made better dynatrons.

The solution was to add another grid between the screen grid and the main anode, called the [[suppressor grid]] (since it suppressed secondary emission current toward the screen grid). This grid was held at the cathode (or &quot;ground&quot;) voltage and its negative voltage (relative to the anode) electrostatically repelled secondary electrons so that they would be collected by the anode after all. This three-grid tube is called a [[pentode]], meaning five electrodes. The pentode was invented in 1926 by [[Bernard D. H. Tellegen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.philips-historische-producten.nl/tube-uk.html |title=Philips Historical Products: Philips Vacuum Tubes |accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became generally favored over the simple tetrode. Pentodes are made in two classes: those with the suppressor grid wired internally to the cathode (e.g. EL84/6BQ5) and those with the suppressor grid wired to a separate pin for user access (e.g. 803, 837). An alternative solution for power applications is the [[beam tetrode]] or &quot;beam power tube&quot;, discussed below.

===Multifunction and multisection tubes===
[[File:Heptode.svg|thumb|right|160px|The pentagrid converter contained five grids between the cathode and the plate (anode).]]
[[Superheterodyne]] receivers require a [[local oscillator]] and [[Frequency mixer|mixer]], combined in the function of a single [[pentagrid converter]] tube. Various alternatives such as using a combination of a [[triode]] with a [[hexode]] and even an [[octode]] have been used for this purpose. The additional grids include both [[control grid]]s (at a low potential) and [[screen grid]]s (at a high voltage). Many designs used such a screen grid as an additional anode to provide feedback for the oscillator function, whose current was added to that of the incoming radio frequency signal. The pentagrid converter thus became widely used in AM receivers including the miniature tube version of the &quot;[[All American Five]]&quot;. Octodes such as the 7A8 were rarely used in the US, but much more common in Europe, particularly in battery operated radios where the lower power consumption was an advantage.

To further reduce the cost and complexity of radio equipment, two separate vacuum tubes could be combined in the bulb of a single ''multisection tube''. An early example was the [[Loewe 3NF]]. This 1920s device had three triodes in a single glass envelope together with all the fixed capacitors and resistors required to make a complete radio receiver. As the Loewe set had only one tube socket, it was able to substantially undercut the competition since, in Germany, state tax was levied by the number of sockets. However, reliability was compromised, and production costs for the tube were much greater. In a sense, these were akin to integrated circuits. In the US, Cleartron briefly produced the &quot;Multivalve&quot; triple triode for use in the Emerson Baby Grand receiver. This Emerson set also had a single tube socket, but because it used a four-pin base, the additional element connections were made on a &quot;mezzanine&quot; platform at the top of the tube base.

[[File:EIA-9A.png|thumb|right|280px|Popular 12AX7 dual triode]]
[[File:12AE10CompactronTube.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Compactron tube: 12AE10, dual pentode]]
By 1940 multisection tubes had become commonplace. There were constraints, however, due to patents and other licensing considerations (see [[British Valve Association]]). Constraints due to the number of external pins (leads) often forced the functions to share some of those external connections such as their cathode connections (in addition to the heater connection). The RCA Type 55 was a [[double diode triode]] used as a detector, [[automatic gain control]] rectifier and audio [[preamplifier]] in early AC powered radios. These sets often included the 53 Dual Triode Audio Output. Another early type of multi-section tube, the [[6SN7]], is a &quot;dual triode&quot; which performs the functions of two triode tubes, while taking up half as much space and costing less.
The [[12AX7]] is a dual &quot;high mu&quot; (high voltage gain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Bonnie |title=Analog circuits |date=2008 |page=391 |publisher=Newnes |isbn=0-7506-8627-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://välljud.se/index.php/tilbehoer/ram-labs/mu-gm-and-rp-and-how-tubes-are-matched |title=Mu, Gm and Rp and how Tubes are matched |last=Modjeski |first=Roger A. |publisher=Välljud AB |accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Glen |authorlink=Glen Ballou |title=Handbook for Sound Engineers: The New Audio Cyclopedia |publisher=Howard W.

The introduction of the miniature tube base (see below) which could have 9 pins, more than previously available, allowed other multi-section tubes to be introduced, such as the [[6GH8]]/ECF82 triode-pentode, quite popular in television receivers. The desire to include even more functions in one envelope resulted in the General Electric [[Compactron]] which had 12 pins. A typical example, the 6AG11, contained two triodes and two diodes.

Some otherwise conventional tubes do not fall into standard categories; the [[6JH8]] had several common grids, followed by a pair of beam deflection electrodes which deflected the current towards either of two anodes. It was sometimes known as the 'sheet beam' tube, and was used in some color TV sets for demodulation of synchronous signals, as for example for color [[demodulation]].

===Beam power tubes===
{{main|Beam tetrode}}
[[File:BPT Pinout.png|thumb|right|149px|Beam power tube symbol and pinout for 6L6]]
The [[beam tetrode|beam]] power tube is usually a tetrode with the addition of beam-forming electrodes, which take the place of the suppressor grid. These angled plates (not to be confused with the ''[[anode]]'') focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons, while also providing pentode behavior. The positioning of the elements in a beam power tube uses a design called &quot;critical-distance geometry&quot;, which minimizes the &quot;tetrode kink&quot;, plate to control grid capacitance, screen grid current, and secondary emission from the anode, thus increasing power conversion efficiency. The control grid and screen grid are also wound with the same pitch, or number of wires per inch.

[[File:6L6tubespair.jpg|thumb|left|150px|6L6 tubes in glass envelopes]]
Aligning the grid wires also helps to reduce screen current, which represents wasted energy. This design helps to overcome some of the practical barriers to designing high-power, high-efficiency power tubes. EMI engineers Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda developed the design which became the [[6L6]], the first popular beam power tube, introduced by [[RCA]] in 1936 and later corresponding tubes in Europe the [[KT66]], [[KT77]] and [[KT88]] made by the [[Marconi-Osram Valve]] subsidiary of [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] (the KT standing for &quot;Kinkless Tetrode&quot;).

&quot;Pentode operation&quot; of beam power tubes is often described in  manufacturers' handbooks and data sheets, resulting in some confusion in terminology.

Variations of the 6L6 design are still widely used in tube guitar amplifiers, making it one of the longest-lived electronic device families in history. Similar design strategies are used in the construction of large ceramic power tetrodes used in radio transmitters.

Beam power tubes can be connected as triodes for improved audio tonal quality but in triode mode deliver significantly reduced power output.

===Gas-filled tubes===
[[Gas-filled tube]]s such as [[discharge tube]]s and [[cold cathode]] tubes are not ''hard'' vacuum tubes, though are always filled with gas at less than sea-level atmospheric pressure. Types such as the [[voltage-regulator tube]] and [[thyratron]] resemble hard vacuum tubes and fit in sockets designed for vacuum tubes. Their distinctive orange, red, or purple glow during operation indicates the presence of gas; electrons flowing in a vacuum do not produce light within that region. These types may still be referred to as &quot;electron tubes&quot; as they do perform electronic functions. High-power rectifiers use [[mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor to achieve a lower forward voltage drop than high-vacuum tubes.

=== Miniature tubes ===
[[File:PIC01180.JPG|thumb|left|150px|PM84 Miniature ''Magic Eye'' indicator tube, alongside a euro coin]]
[[File:CV4501.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Subminiature CV4501 tube, {{nowrap|35 mm long}} x {{nowrap|10 mm diameter}} (excluding leads)]]
[[File:6DS4NuvistorVacuumTube.jpg|thumb|right|150px|RCA 6DS4 &quot;Nuvistor&quot; triode, circa {{nowrap|20 mm high}} by {{nowrap|11 mm diameter}}]]
Early tubes used a metal or glass envelope atop an insulating [[bakelite]] base. In 1938 a technique was developed to instead use an all-glass construction&lt;ref&gt;C H Gardner (1965) [http://www.r-type.org/articles/art-001.htm The Story of the Valve], Radio Constructor (See particularly the section &quot;Glass Base Construction&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; with the pins fused in the glass base of the envelope. This was used in the design of a much smaller tube outline, known as the miniature tube, having 7 or 9 pins. Making tubes smaller reduced the voltage that they could work at, and also the power of the filament. Miniature tubes became predominant in consumer applications such as radio receivers and hi-fi amplifiers. However the larger older styles continued to be used especially as higher power [[rectifier]]s, in higher power audio output stages and as transmitting tubes.

Subminiature tubes with a size roughly that of half a cigarette were used in hearing-aid amplifiers. These tubes did not have pins plugging into a socket but were soldered in place. The &quot;acorn&quot; valve (named due to its shape) was also very small, as was the metal-cased RCA [[nuvistor]] from 1959, about the size of a [[thimble]]. The small size supported especially high-frequency operation; nuvistors were used in [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television tuners until replaced by high-frequency transistors.

===Improvements in construction and performance===
The earliest vacuum tubes strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and were made by lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the [[vacuum pump]]s required to evacuate the enclosures. De Forest used [[Heinrich Geissler]]'s mercury displacement pump, which left behind a partial [[vacuum]]. The development of the [[diffusion pump]] in 1915 and improvement by [[Irving Langmuir]] led to the development of high-vacuum tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare tungsten filaments operated at a temperature of around 2200&amp;nbsp;°C. The development of oxide-coated filaments in the mid-1920s reduced filament [[operating temperature]] to a dull red heat (around 700&amp;nbsp;°C), which in turn reduced thermal distortion of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare tungsten filaments remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly – e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to stationary equipment where impact and vibration is not present.

===Indirectly heated cathodes===
The desire to power electronic equipment using AC mains power faced a difficulty with respect to the powering of the tubes' filaments, as these were also the cathode of each tube. Powering the filaments directly from a [[power transformer]] introduced mains-frequency (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) hum into audio stages. The invention of the &quot;equipotential cathode&quot; reduced this problem, with the filaments being powered by a balanced AC power transformer winding having a grounded center tap.

A superior solution, and one which allowed each cathode to &quot;float&quot; at a different voltage, was that of the indirectly heated cathode: a  cylinder of oxide-coated nickel acted as electron-emitting cathode, and was electrically isolated from the filament inside it. Indirectly heated cathodes enable the cathode circuit to be separated from the heater circuit. The filament, no longer electrically connected to the tube's electrodes, became simply known as a &quot;heater&quot;, and could as well be powered by AC without any introduction of hum.&lt;ref&gt;L.W. Turner (ed.) ''Electronics Engineer's Reference Book'', 4th ed. Newnes-Butterworth, London 1976 ISBN 0-408-00168-2 pages 7–2 through 7-6&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s indirectly heated cathode tubes became widespread in equipment using AC power. Directly heated cathode tubes continued to be widely used in battery-powered equipment as their filaments required considerably less power than the heaters required with indirectly heated cathodes.

Tubes designed for high gain audio applications may have twisted heater wires to cancel out stray hum fields from being induced into the cathode.

Heaters may be energised with either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC). DC is often used where low hum is required.

Flowers was also a pioneer of using tubes as very fast (compared to electromechanical devices) [[Switch#Electronic switches|electronic switches]]. Later work confirmed that tube unreliability was not as serious an issue as generally believed; the 1946 [[ENIAC]], with over 17,000 tubes, had a tube failure (which took 15 minutes to locate) on average every two days. The quality of the tubes was a factor, and unfortunately the diversion of skilled people during the Second World War lowered the general quality of tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2006/0,4814,108568,00.html|title=A lost interview with ENIAC co-inventor J.

After the war, development continued with tube-based computers including, military computers [[ENIAC]] and [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]], the [[Ferranti Mark 1]] (the first commercially available electronic computer), and [[UNIVAC I]], also available commercially.

====Colossus====
{{Main|Colossus computer}}
Flowers's Colossus and its successor Colossus Mk2 were built by the British during World War II to substantially speed up the task of breaking the German high level [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz encryption]]. Using about 1,500 vacuum tubes (2,400 for Mk2), Colossus replaced an earlier machine based on relay and switch logic (the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]). Colossus was able to break in a matter of hours messages that had previously taken several weeks; it was also much more reliable.&lt;ref name=colossus/&gt; Colossus was the first use of vacuum tubes ''working in concert'' on such a large scale for a single machine.&lt;ref name=colossus/&gt;

Once Colossus was built and installed, it ran continuously, powered by dual redundant diesel generators, the wartime mains supply being considered too unreliable. The only time it was switched off was for conversion to Mk2, with the addition of more tubes. Another nine Colossus Mk2s were built, and all ten machines were surprisingly reliable. The ten machines drew 15 kilowatts of power each continuously, largely for the tube heaters.

A Colossus reconstruction was switched on in 1996; it was upgraded to Mk2 configuration in 2004; it found the key for a wartime German [[ciphertext]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|[http://www.tnmoc.org/special-projects/colossus-rebuild/rebuilding-colossus The National Museum of Computing – Rebuilding Colossus]|[http://www.tnmoc.org/explore/colossus-gallery The National Museum of Computing – The Colossus Gallery]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Whirlwind and &quot;special-quality&quot; tubes====
{{Main|Whirlwind (computer)}}
To meet the reliability requirements of the 1951 US digital computer Whirlwind, &quot;special-quality&quot; tubes with extended life, and a long-lasting cathode in particular, were produced. The problem of short lifetime was traced to evaporation of [[silicon]], used in the [[tungsten]] alloy to make the heater wire easier to draw. Elimination of silicon from the heater wire alloy (and more frequent replacement of the [[wire]] drawing [[Die (manufacturing)#Wire pulling|dies]]) allowed production of tubes that were reliable enough for the Whirlwind project. The tubes developed for Whirlwind were later used in the giant [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] air-defense computer system. High-purity nickel tubing and cathode coatings free of materials that can poison emission (such as [[silicate]]s and aluminium) also contribute to long cathode life. The first such &quot;computer tube&quot; was Sylvania's 7AK7 of 1948. By the late 1950s it was routine for special-quality small-signal tubes to last for hundreds of thousands of hours, if operated conservatively. This increased reliability also made mid-cable amplifiers in [[Submarine communications cable|submarine cable]]s possible.

==Heat generation and cooling ==
[[File:HiPowerTube3-500 C.jpg|thumb|right| The anode (plate) of this transmitting triode has been designed to dissipate up to {{nowrap|500 W}} of heat]]
A considerable amount of heat is  produced when tubes operate, both from the filament (heater) but also from the stream of electrons bombarding the plate. In power amplifiers this source of heat will exceed the power due to cathode heating.
A few types of tube permit operation with the anodes at a dull red heat; in other types, red heat indicates severe overload.

The requirements for heat removal can significantly change the appearance of high-power vacuum tubes. High power audio amplifiers and rectifiers required larger envelopes to dissipate heat. Transmitting tubes could be much larger still.

Heat escapes the device by [[black body radiation]] from the anode (plate) as infrared radiation, and by convection of air over the tube envelope.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;RCA &quot;Transmitting Tubes  Manual&quot; TT-5 1962, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Convection]] is not possible in most tubes since the anode is surrounded by vacuum.

Tubes which generate relatively little heat, such as the 1.4-volt filament directly heated tubes designed for use in battery-powered equipment, often have shiny metal anodes. 1T4, 1R5 and 1A7 are examples. Gas-filled tubes such as [[thyratron]]s may also use a shiny metal anode, since the gas present inside the tube allows for heat convection from the anode to the glass enclosure.

The anode is often treated to make its surface emit more infrared energy. High-power amplifier tubes are designed with external anodes which can be cooled by convection, forced air or circulating water. The water-cooled 80&amp;nbsp;kg, 1.25&amp;nbsp;MW [[8974]] is among the largest commercial tubes available today.

In a water-cooled tube, the anode voltage appears directly on the cooling water surface, thus requiring the water to be an electrical insulator to prevent  high voltage leakage through the cooling water to the radiator system. Water as usually supplied has ions which conduct electricity; [[deionized water]], a good insulator, is required. Such systems usually have a built-in water-conductance monitor which will shut down the high-tension supply if the conductance  becomes too high.

The screen grid may also generate considerable heat. Limits to screen grid dissipation, in addition to plate dissipation, are listed for power devices. If these are exceeded then tube failure is likely.

==Tube packages==
[[File:6Z4 var.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Metal-cased tubes with octal bases]]
[[File:GS-9B.JPG|thumb|right|300px|High power GS-9B triode transmitting tube with heat sink at bottom.]]
Most modern tubes have glass envelopes, but metal, fused quartz ([[silica]]) and [[ceramic]] have also been used. A first version of the 6L6 used a metal envelope sealed with glass beads, while a glass disk fused to the metal was used in later versions. Metal and ceramic are used almost exclusively for power tubes above 2&amp;nbsp;kW dissipation. The [[nuvistor]] was a modern receiving tube using a very small metal and ceramic package.

The internal elements of tubes have always been connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which plug into a socket. Subminiature tubes were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections at the base of the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a metal cap at the top of the tube; this reduces stray [[capacitance]] between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate (anode) connection, particularly in transmitting tubes and tubes using a very high plate voltage.

High-power tubes such as transmitting tubes have packages designed more to enhance heat transfer. In some tubes, the metal envelope is also the anode. The 4CX1000A is an external anode tube of this sort. Air is blown through an array of fins attached to the anode, thus cooling it. Power tubes using this cooling scheme are available up to 150&amp;nbsp;kW dissipation. Above that level, water or water-vapor cooling are used. The highest-power tube currently available is the [[Eimac]] {{as written|4CM2500KG}}, a forced water-cooled power tetrode capable of dissipating 2.5 megawatts. (By comparison, the largest power transistor can only dissipate about 1 kilowatt.)

==Names==
The generic name &quot;[thermionic] valve&quot; used in the UK derives from the unidirectional current flow allowed by the earliest device, the thermionic diode emitting electrons from a heated filament, by analogy with a non-return [[valve]] in a water pipe.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science, J. L. Heilbron , Oxford University Press 2003, 9780195112290, &quot;valve, thermionic&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The US names &quot;vacuum tube&quot;, &quot;electron tube&quot;, and &quot;thermionic tube&quot; all simply describe a tubular envelope which has been evacuated (&quot;vacuum&quot;), has a heater, and controls electron flow.

In many cases manufacturers and the military gave tubes designations which said nothing about their purpose (e.g., 1614). In the early days some manufacturers used proprietary names which might convey some information, but only about their products; the KT66 and KT88 were &quot;'''K'''inkless '''T'''etrodes&quot;. Later, consumer tubes were given names which conveyed some information, with the same name often used generically by several manufacturers. In the US, [[Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association]] (RETMA) [[RETMA tube designation|designations]] comprise a number, followed by one or two letters, and a number. The first number is the (rounded) heater voltage; the letters designate a particular tube but say nothing about its structure; and the final number is the total number of electrodes (without distinguishing between, say, a tube with many electrodes, or two sets of electrodes in a single envelope—a double triode, for example). For example, the [[12AX7]] is a double triode (two sets of three electrodes plus heater) with a 12.6V heater (which, as it happens, can also be connected to run from 6.3V). The &quot;AX&quot; has no meaning other than to designate this particular tube according to its characteristics. Similar, but not identical, tubes are the 12AD7, 12AE7...12AT7, 12AU7, 12AV7, 12AW7 (rare!), 12AY7, and the 12AZ7.

A system widely used in Europe known as the [[Mullard-Philips tube designation]], also extended to transistors, uses a letter, followed by one or more further letters, and a number. The type designator specifies the heater voltage or current (one letter), the functions of all sections of the tube (one letter per section), the socket type (first digit), and the particular tube (remaining digits). For example, the ECC83 (equivalent to the 12AX7) is a 6.3V (E) double triode (CC) with a miniature base (8). In this system special-quality tubes (e.g., for long-life computer use) are indicated by moving the number immediately after the first letter: the E83CC is a special-quality equivalent of the ECC83, the E55L a power pentode with no consumer equivalent.

==Special-purpose tubes==
[[File:5651RegulatorTubeInOperation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Voltage-regulator tube in operation. Low pressure gas within tube glows due to current flow.]]
Some special-purpose tubes are constructed with particular gases in the envelope. For instance, [[voltage-regulator tube]]s contain various [[inert gas]]es such as [[argon]], [[helium]] or [[neon]], which will [[Ionization|ionize]] at predictable voltages. The [[thyratron]] is a special-purpose tube filled with low-pressure gas or mercury vapor. Like vacuum tubes, it contains a hot cathode and an anode, but also a control electrode which behaves somewhat like the grid of a triode. When the control electrode starts conduction, the gas ionizes, after which the control electrode can no longer stop the current; the tube &quot;latches&quot; into conduction. Removing anode (plate) voltage lets the gas de-ionize, restoring its non-conductive state. Some thyratrons can carry large currents for their physical size. One example is the miniature type 2D21, often seen in 1950s [[jukebox]]es as control switches for [[relay]]s. A cold-cathode version of the thyratron, which uses a pool of mercury for its cathode, is called an [[ignitron]]; some can switch thousands of amperes. Thyratrons containing hydrogen have a very consistent time delay between their turn-on pulse and full conduction; they behave much like modern [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s, also called [[thyristor]]s due to their functional similarity to thyratrons. Thyratrons have long been used in radar transmitters.

An extremely specialized tube is the [[krytron]], which is used for extremely precise and rapid high-voltage switching. Krytrons with certain specifications are suitable to initiate the precise sequence of detonations used to set off a [[nuclear weapon]], and are heavily controlled at an international level.

[[X-ray tube]]s are used in medical imaging among other uses. X-ray tubes used for continuous-duty operation in fluoroscopy and [[X-ray computed tomography|CT imaging]] equipment may use a focused cathode and a rotating anode to dissipate the large amounts of heat thereby generated. These are housed in an oil-filled aluminium housing to provide cooling.

The [[photomultiplier]] tube is an extremely sensitive detector of light, which uses the [[photoelectric effect]] and [[secondary emission]], rather than thermionic emission, to generate and amplify electrical signals. Nuclear medicine imaging equipment and [[liquid scintillation counting|liquid scintillation counters]] use photomultiplier tube arrays to detect low-intensity [[Scintillation counter|scintillation]] due to [[ionizing radiation]].

==Powering the tube==

===Batteries===

{{main|Battery (vacuum tube)}}

[[Battery (electricity)|Batteries]] provided the voltages required by tubes in early radio sets. Three different voltages were generally required, using three different batteries designated as the '''A''', '''B''', and '''C''' battery. The [[A battery|&quot;A&quot; battery]] or LT (low-tension) battery provided the filament voltage. Tube heaters were designed for single, double or triple-cell [[lead–acid battery|lead-acid]] batteries, giving nominal heater voltages of 2 V, 4 V or 6 V. In portable radios, dry batteries were sometimes used with 1.5 or 1 V heaters. Reducing filament consumption improved the life span of batteries. By 1955 towards the end of the tube era, tubes using only 50 mA down to as little as 10 mA for the heaters had been developed.&lt;ref name=Okamura94&gt;{{cite book|author=Sōgo Okamura|title=History of electron tubes|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VHFyngmO95YC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=9 May 2011|date=1994|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-90-5199-145-1|pages=133–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high voltage applied to the anode (plate) was provided by the [[B battery|&quot;B&quot; battery]] or the HT (high-tension) supply or battery. These were generally of [[dry cell]] construction and typically came in 22.5-, 45-, 67.5-, 90-, 120- or 135-volt versions.

[[File:C Battery circuit of a Triode vacuum tube.png|thumb|right| Batteries for a vacuum tube circuit. The C battery is highlighted.]]
Early sets used a grid bias battery or [[GB Battery|&quot;C&quot; battery]] which was connected to provide a ''negative'' voltage. Since virtually no current flows through a tube's grid connection, these batteries had very low drain and lasted the longest. Even after AC power supplies became commonplace, some radio sets continued to be built with C batteries, as they would almost never need replacing. However more modern circuits were designed using [[cathode bias]]ing, eliminating the need for a third power supply voltage; this became practical with tubes using indirect heating of the cathode.

The &quot;C battery&quot; for bias is a designation having no relation to the &quot;[[C battery|C cell]]&quot; [[List of battery sizes|battery size]].

===AC power===
{{Redirect|Cheater cord|the three-prong to two-prong mains plug adapter|Cheater plug}}
Battery replacement was a major operating cost for early radio receiver users. The development of the [[battery eliminator]], and, in 1925, [[Batteryless radio|batteryless receivers]] operated by [[Mains electricity|household power]], reduced operating costs and contributed to the growing popularity of radio. A [[power supply]] using a [[transformer]] with several windings, one or more [[rectifier]]s (which may themselves be vacuum tubes), and large filter [[electrolytic capacitor|capacitor]]s  provided the required [[direct current]] voltages from the alternating current source.

As a cost reduction measure, especially in high-volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current and with a similar warm-up time. In one such design, a tap on the tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a half-wave rectifier directly connected to the AC mains, the heavy and costly power transformer was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so-called [[AC/DC receiver design]]. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname [[All American Five]].

Where the mains voltage was in the 100-120V range, this limited voltage proved suitable only for low-power receivers. Television receivers either required a transformer or could use a [[voltage doubler|voltage doubling]] circuit. Where 230 V nominal mains voltage was used, television receivers as well could dispense with a power transformer.

Transformer-less power supplies required safety precautions in their design to limit the shock hazard to users, such as electrically insulated cabinets and an [[Interlock (engineering)|interlock]] tying the power cord to the cabinet back, so the line cord was necessarily disconnected if the user or service person opened the cabinet. A ''cheater cord'' was a power cord ending in the special socket used by the safety interlock; servicers could then power the device with the hazardous voltages exposed.

To avoid the warm-up delay, &quot;instant on&quot; television receivers passed a small heating current through their tubes even when the set was nominally off. At switch on, full heating current was provided and the set would play almost immediately.

==Reliability==
[[File:Acremeter tube tester.jpg|thumb|upright|Tube tester manufactured in 1930]]
One reliability problem of tubes with oxide cathodes is the possibility that the cathode may slowly become &quot;[[cathode poisoning|poisoned]]&quot; by gas molecules from other elements in the tube, which reduce its ability to emit electrons. Trapped gases or slow gas leaks can also damage the cathode or cause plate (anode) current runaway due to [[ionization]] of free gas molecules. [[Vacuum]] hardness and proper selection of construction materials are the major influences on tube lifetime. Depending on the material, temperature and construction, the surface material of the cathode may also diffuse onto other elements. The resistive heaters that heat the cathodes may break in a manner similar to [[incandescent lamp]] filaments, but rarely do, since they operate at much lower temperatures than lamps.

The heater's failure mode is typically a stress-related fracture of the tungsten wire or at a weld point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal (power on-off) cycles. Tungsten wire has a very low resistance when at room temperature. A negative temperature coefficient device, such as a [[thermistor]], may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp-up circuit may be employed to allow the heater or filaments to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered-up in a step-function. Low-cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage equal to that of the line (mains). Following World War II, tubes intended to be used in series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same (&quot;controlled&quot;) warm-up time. Earlier designs had quite-different thermal time constants. The audio output stage, for instance, had a larger cathode, and warmed up more slowly than lower-powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of their positive temperature coefficient. This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily operate with heater voltages well above their ratings, and shortened their life.

Another important reliability problem is caused by air leakage into the tube. Usually [[oxygen]] in the air reacts chemically with the hot filament or cathode, quickly ruining it. Designers developed tube designs that sealed reliably. This was why most tubes were constructed of glass. Metal alloys (such as [[Cunife]] and [[Fernico]]) and glasses had been developed for light bulbs that expanded and contracted in similar amounts, as temperature changed. These made it easy to construct an insulating envelope of glass, while passing connection wires through the glass to the electrodes.

When a vacuum tube is overloaded or operated past its design dissipation, its anode (plate) may glow red. In consumer equipment, a [[glowing plate]] is universally a sign of an overloaded tube. However, some large transmitting tubes are designed to operate with their anodes at red, orange, or in rare cases, white heat.

&quot;Special quality&quot; versions of standard tubes were often made, designed for improved performance in some respect, such as long life, low noise, mechanical ruggedness, low microphony, for applications where the tube will spend much of its time cut off, etc. The only way to know the particular features of a special quality part is by reading the data sheet. Names may reflect the standard name (12AU7==&gt;12AU7A, its equivalent ECC82==&gt;E82CC, etc.), or be absolutely anything (standard and special-quality equivalents of the same tube include 12AU7, ECC82, B329, CV491, E2163, E812CC, M8136, CV4003, 6067, VX7058, 5814A and 12AU7A).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/addtext/add070.htm National Valve Museum: audio double triodes ECC81, 2, and 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest recorded valve life was earned by a Mazda AC/P pentode valve (serial No. 4418) in operation at the [[BBC]]'s main Northern Ireland transmitter at Lisnagarvey. The valve was in service from 1935 until 1961 and had a recorded life of 232,592 hours. The BBC maintained meticulous records of their valves' lives with periodic returns to their central valve stores.&lt;ref&gt;Certified by BBC central valve stores, Motspur Park&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vacuum===
[[File:Getter diagram.png|thumb|right|350px|Getter in opened tube; silvery deposit from getter]]
[[File:Opachki dead vacuum luminescent display bednyaga da.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Dead vacuum fluorescent display (air has leaked in and the getter spot has become white)]]
The highest possible vacuum is desired in a tube. Remaining gas atoms will [[Ionization|ionize]] and conduct electricity between the elements in an undesired manner. In a defective tube residual air pressure will lead to ionization, becoming visible as a pink-purple [[glow discharge]] between the tube elements. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

To prevent gases from compromising the tube's vacuum, modern tubes are constructed with &quot;[[getter]]s&quot;, which are usually small, circular troughs filled with metals that oxidize quickly, [[barium]] being the most common. While the tube envelope is being evacuated, the internal parts except the getter are heated by [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[induction heating]] to evolve any remaining gas from the metal parts. The tube is then sealed and the getter is heated to a high temperature, again by radio frequency induction heating, which causes the getter material to vaporize and react with any residual gas. The vapor is deposited on the inside of the glass envelope, leaving a silver-colored metallic patch which continues to absorb small amounts of gas that may leak into the tube during its working life. Great care is taken with the valve design to ensure this material is not deposited on any of the working electrodes. If a tube develops a serious leak in the envelope, this deposit turns a white color as it reacts with atmospheric [[oxygen]]. Large transmitting and specialized tubes often use more exotic getter materials, such as [[zirconium]]. Early gettered tubes used phosphorus-based getters, and these tubes are easily identifiable, as the phosphorus leaves a characteristic orange or rainbow deposit on the glass. The use of phosphorus was short-lived and was quickly replaced by the superior barium getters. Unlike the barium getters, the phosphorus did not absorb any further gases once it had fired.

Getters act by chemically combining with residual or infiltrating gases, but are unable to counteract (non-reactive) inert gases. A known problem, mostly affecting valves with large envelopes such as Cathode Ray Tubes and camera tubes such as Iconoscopes and Orthicons/Image Orthicons, comes from '''helium''' infiltration. The effect appears as impaired or absent functioning, and as a diffuse glow along the electron stream inside the tube. This effect cannot be rectified (short of re-evacuation and resealing), and is responsible for working examples of such tubes becoming rarer and rarer. Unused (&quot;New Old Stock&quot;) tubes can also exhibit inert gas infiltration, so there is no long-term guarantee of these tube types surviving into the future.

===Transmitting tubes===
Large transmitting tubes have carbonized [[tungsten]] filaments containing a small trace (1% to 2%)  of [[thorium]]. An extremely thin (molecular) layer of thorium atoms forms on the outside of the wire's carbonized layer and, when heated, serve as an efficient source of electrons. The thorium slowly evaporates from the wire surface, while new thorium atoms [[diffusion|diffuse]] to the surface to replace them. Such thoriated tungsten cathodes usually deliver lifetimes in the tens of thousands of hours. The end-of-life scenario for a thoriated-tungsten filament is when the carbonized layer has mostly been converted back into another form of [[tungsten carbide]] and emission begins to drop off rapidly; a complete loss of thorium has never been found to be a factor in the end-of-life in a tube with this type of emitter.
[[WAAY-TV]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] achieved 163,000 hours of service from an [[Eimac]] external cavity klystron in the visual circuit of its transmitter; this is the highest documented service life for this type of tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=31 Alumni|title=The Klystron &amp; Cactus|url=http://31alumni.com/klystron-cactus.htm|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been said{{who|date=November 2010}} that transmitters with vacuum tubes are better able to survive lightning strikes than transistor transmitters do. While it was commonly believed that at RF power levels above approx. 20 kilowatts, vacuum tubes were more efficient than solid state circuits, this is no longer the case especially in medium wave (AM broadcast) service where solid state transmitters at nearly all power levels have measurably higher efficiency. FM broadcast transmitters with solid state power amplifiers up to approx. 15&amp;nbsp;kW also show better overall mains-power efficiency than tube-based power amplifiers.

===Receiving tubes===
Cathodes in small &quot;receiving&quot; tubes are coated with a mixture of [[barium oxide]] and [[strontium oxide]], sometimes with addition of [[calcium oxide]] or [[aluminium oxide]]. An electric heater is inserted into the cathode sleeve, and insulated from it electrically by a coating of aluminium oxide. This complex construction causes barium and strontium atoms to diffuse to the surface of the cathode and emit electrons when heated to about 780 degrees Celsius.

===Failure modes===

====Catastrophic failures====
A catastrophic failure is one which suddenly makes the vacuum tube unusable. A crack in the glass envelope will allow air into the tube and destroy it. Cracks may result from stress in the glass, bent pins or impacts; tube sockets must allow for thermal expansion, to prevent stress in the glass at the pins. Stress may accumulate if a metal shield or other object presses on the tube envelope and causes differential heating of the glass. Glass may also be damaged by high-voltage arcing.

Tube heaters may also fail without warning, especially if exposed to over voltage or as a result of manufacturing defects. Tube heaters do not normally fail by evaporation like [[incandescent light bulb|lamp]] filaments, since they operate at much lower temperature. The surge of [[inrush current]] when the heater is first energized causes stress in the heater, and can be avoided by slowly warming the heaters, gradually increasing current with a NTC [[thermistor]] included in the circuit. Tubes intended for series-string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled warm-up time to avoid excess voltage on some heaters as others warm up. Directly heated filament-type cathodes as used in battery-operated tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing. Excess heater-to-cathode voltage in indirectly heated cathodes can break down the insulation between elements and destroy the heater.

[[Electric arc|Arcing]] between tube elements can destroy the tube. An arc can be caused by applying voltage to the anode (plate) before the cathode has come up to operating temperature, or by drawing excess current through a rectifier, which damages the emission coating. Arcs can also be initiated by any loose material inside the tube, or by excess screen voltage. An arc inside the tube allows gas to evolve from the tube materials, and may deposit conductive material on internal insulating spacers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Robert B. |last=Tomer |title=Getting the most out of vacuum tubes |publisher=Howard W. Sams |location=Indianapolis, IN, USA |date=1960 |lccn=60-13843}}. available on the Internet Archive. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Tube rectifiers have limited current capability and exceeding ratings will eventually destroy a tube.

====Degenerative failures====
Degenerative failures are those caused by the slow deterioration of performance over time.

Overheating of internal parts, such as control grids or mica spacer insulators, can result in trapped gas escaping into the tube; this can reduce performance. A [[getter]] is used to absorb gases evolved during tube operation, but has only a limited ability to combine with gas. Control of the envelope temperature prevents some types of gassing. A tube with an unusually high level of internal gas may exhibit a visible blue glow when plate voltage is applied. The getter (being a highly reactive metal) is effective against many atmospheric gases, but has no (or very limited) chemical reactivity to inert gases such as helium. One progressive type of failure, especially with physically large envelopes such as those used by camera tubes and cathode-ray tubes, comes from helium infiltration. The exact mechanism not clear: the metal-to-glass lead-in seals are one possible infiltration site.

Gas and ions within the tube contribute to grid current which can disturb operation of a vacuum tube circuit. Another effect of overheating is the slow deposit of metallic vapors on internal spacers, resulting in inter-element leakage.

Tubes on standby for long periods, with heater voltage applied, may develop high cathode interface resistance and display poor emission characteristics. This effect occurred especially in pulse and [[digital circuit]]s, where tubes had no plate current flowing for extended times. Tubes designed specifically for this mode of operation were made.

Cathode depletion is the loss of emission after thousands of hours of normal use. Sometimes emission can be restored for a time by raising heater voltage, either for a short time or a permanent increase of a few percent. Cathode depletion was uncommon in signal tubes but was a frequent cause of failure of monochrome television [[cathode-ray tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomer|1960|loc=60, chapter 2}}&lt;!-- 60 might mean 1960--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Usable life of this expensive component was sometimes extended by fitting a boost transformer to increase heater voltage.

====Other failures====
Vacuum tubes may have or develop defects in operation that make an individual tube unsuitable in a given device, although it may perform satisfactorily in another application. ''[[Microphonics]]'' refers to internal vibrations of tube elements which modulate the tube's signal in an undesirable way; sound or vibration pick-up may affect the signals, or even cause uncontrolled howling if a feedback path develops between a microphonic tube and, for example, a loudspeaker. Leakage current between AC heaters and the cathode may couple into the circuit, or electrons emitted directly from the ends of the heater may also inject [[Mains hum|hum]] into the signal. Leakage current due to internal contamination may also inject noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomer|1960|loc=60, chapter 3}}&lt;!-- 60 might mean 1960 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these effects make tubes unsuitable for small-signal audio use, although unobjectionable for many purposes. Selecting the best of a batch of nominally identical tubes for critical applications can produce better results.

Tube pins are designed to facilitate installation and removal from its socket but, due to the high operating temperatures of these devices and/or ingress of dirt and dust over time, pins can develop non-conducting or high resistance surface films. Pins can be easily cleaned to restore conductance to normal standards.

==Testing==
[[File:VacuumTubeTester TV-7D 4.jpg|thumb|200px|Universal vacuum tester]]
Vacuum tubes can be tested outside of its circuitry using a vacuum tube tester.

==Other vacuum tube devices==
Most small signal vacuum tube devices have been superseded by semiconductors, but some vacuum tube electronic devices are still in common use. The magnetron is the type of tube used in all [[microwave oven]]s. In spite of the advancing state of the art in power semiconductor technology, the vacuum tube still has reliability and cost advantages for high-frequency RF power generation.

Some tubes, such as [[magnetron]]s, [[traveling-wave tube]]s, [[carcinotron]]s, and [[klystron]]s, combine magnetic and electrostatic effects. These are efficient (usually narrow-band) RF generators and still find use in [[radar]], [[microwave oven]]s and industrial heating. Traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) are very good amplifiers and are even used in some communications satellites. High-powered klystron amplifier tubes can provide hundreds of kilowatts in the UHF range.

===Cathode ray tubes===
{{main|Cathode ray tube}}
The [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) is a vacuum tube used particularly for display purposes. Although there are still many televisions and computer monitors using cathode ray tubes, they are rapidly being replaced by [[flat panel display]]s whose quality has greatly improved even as their prices drop. This is also true of digital [[oscilloscope]]s (based on internal computers and [[analog to digital converter]]s), although  traditional analog scopes (dependent upon CRTs) continue to be produced, are economical, and preferred by many technicians. At one time many radios used &quot;[[magic eye tube]]s&quot;, a specialized sort of CRT used in place of a [[Galvanometer|meter movement]] to indicate signal strength, or input level in a tape recorder. A modern indicator device, the [[vacuum fluorescent display]] (VFD) is also a sort of cathode ray tube.

[[Gyrotron]]s or vacuum masers, used to generate high-power millimeter band waves, are magnetic vacuum tubes in which a small [[relativity (physics)|relativistic]] effect, due to the high voltage, is used for bunching the electrons. Gyrotrons can generate very high powers (hundreds of kilowatts).
[[Free electron laser]]s, used to generate high-power coherent light and even [[X-ray]]s, are highly relativistic vacuum tubes driven by high-energy particle accelerators. Thus these are sorts of cathode ray tubes.

===Electron multipliers===
A [[photomultiplier]] is a [[phototube]] whose sensitivity is greatly increased through the use of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of [[secondary emission]], whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a [[dynode]] causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of [[ionizing radiation]] as an alternative to the [[Geiger–Müller tube]] (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.

For decades, electron-tube designers tried to augment amplifying tubes with electron multipliers in order to increase gain, but these suffered from short life because the material used for the dynodes &quot;poisoned&quot; the tube's hot cathode. (For instance, the interesting RCA 1630 secondary-emission tube was marketed, but did not last.) However, eventually, Philips of the Netherlands developed the EFP60 tube that had a satisfactory lifetime, and was used in at least one product, a laboratory pulse generator. By that time, however, transistors were rapidly improving, making such developments superfluous.

One variant called a &quot;channel electron multiplier&quot; does not use individual dynodes but consists of a curved tube, such as a helix, coated on the inside with material with good secondary emission. One type had a funnel of sorts to capture the secondary electrons. The continuous dynode was resistive, and its ends were connected to enough voltage to create repeated cascades of electrons. The [[microchannel plate]] consists of an array of single stage electron multipliers over an image plane; several of these can then be stacked. This can be used, for instance, as an [[image intensifier]] in which the discrete channels substitute for focussing.

Tektronix made a high-performance wideband oscilloscope CRT with a channel electron multiplier plate behind the phosphor layer. This plate was a bundled array of a huge number of short individual c.e.m. tubes that accepted a low-current beam and intensified it to provide a display of practical brightness. (The electron optics of the wideband electron gun could not provide enough current to directly excite the phosphor.)

==Vacuum tubes in the 21st century==

===Niche applications===
Although vacuum tubes have been largely replaced by [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]]  devices in most amplifying, switching, and rectifying applications, there are certain exceptions. In addition to the special functions noted above, tubes {{As of|2011|alt=still}} have some niche applications.

In general, vacuum tubes are much less susceptible than corresponding solid-state components to transient overvoltages, such as mains voltage surges or lightning, the [[electromagnetic pulse]] effect of [[nuclear explosion]]s&lt;ref name=chaos&gt;Broad, William J. &quot;Nuclear Pulse (I): Awakening to the Chaos Factor&quot;, Science. 29 May 1981 212: 1009–1012&lt;/ref&gt; or [[geomagnetic storm]]s produced by giant solar flares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1549/2 Y Butt, The Space Review, 2011] &quot;... geomagnetic storms, on occasion, can induce more powerful pulses than the E3 pulse from even megaton type nuclear weapons.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This property kept them in use for certain military applications long after more practical and less expensive solid-state technology was available for the same applications, as for example with the [[MiG-25]].&lt;ref name=chaos/&gt;

Vacuum tubes are still practical alternatives to solid state in generating high power at [[radio frequencies]] in applications such as industrial radio frequency heating,  [[particle accelerator]]s, and [[Valve transmitters|broadcast transmitters]]. This is particularly true at microwave frequencies where such devices as the [[klystron]] and [[traveling-wave tube]] provide amplification at power levels unattainable using {{As of|2011|alt=current}} semiconductor devices. The household [[microwave oven]] uses a [[magnetron]] tube to efficiently generate hundreds of watts of microwave power.

Enough people prefer [[tube sound]] to make tube amplifiers commercially viable in three areas: musical instrument (guitar) amplifiers, devices used in recording studios, and [[audiophile]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The cool sound of tubes – vacuum tube musical applications|author=Barbour, E.

Many guitarists prefer using [[valve amplifier]]s to solid-state models. Most popular vintage models use vacuum tubes.

===Vacuum fluorescent display===
{{Main|Vacuum fluorescent display}}
[[File:Vacuum fluorescent 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Typical VFD used in a [[videocassette recorder]]]]
A modern display technology using a variation of cathode ray tube is often used in [[videocassette recorder]]s, DVD players and recorders, microwave oven control panels,  and automotive dashboards. Rather than [[raster scanning]], these [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFD) switch control grids and anode voltages on and off, for instance, to display discrete characters. The VFD uses [[phosphor]]-coated anodes as in other display cathode ray tubes. Because the filaments are in view, they must be operated at temperatures where the filament does not glow visibly. This is possible using more recent cathode technology, and these tubes also operate with quite low anode voltages (often less than 50 volts) unlike cathode ray tubes. Their high brightness allows reading the display in bright daylight. VFD tubes are flat and rectangular, as well as relatively thin. Typical VFD phosphors emit a broad spectrum of greenish-white light, permitting use of color filters, though different phosphors can give other colors even within the same display. The design of these tubes provides a bright glow despite the low energy of the incident electrons. This is because the distance between the cathode and anode is relatively small. (This technology is distinct from [[fluorescent light]]ing, which uses a [[discharge tube]].)

===Vacuum tubes using field electron emitters===
In the early years of the 21st century there has been renewed interest in vacuum tubes, this time with the electron emitter formed on a flat silicon substrate, as in [[integrated circuit]] technology. This subject is now called vacuum nanoelectronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ackerman|first=Evan|title=Vacuum tubes could be the future of computing|url=http://www.dvice.com/archives/2012/05/vacuum-tubes-co.php|work=Dvice|publisher=Dvice|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common design uses a [[cold cathode]] in the form of a [[field electron emission|large-area field electron source]] (for example a [[field emitter array]]). With these devices, electrons are field-emitted from a large number of closely spaced individual emission sites.

Their claimed advantages{{Clarify|date=April 2012|reason=relative to what? Tubes, semiconductors?}} include much greater robustness and the ability to provide high power output at low power consumption. Operating on the same principles as traditional tubes, prototype device cathodes have been fabricated in several different ways. Although a common approach is to use a field emitter array, one interesting idea is to etch electrodes to form hinged flaps – similar to the technology used to create the microscopic mirrors used in [[digital light processing]] – that are stood upright by an [[electrostatic charge]]{{Clarify|date=April 2012}}.

Such integrated microtubes may find application in [[microwave]] devices including mobile phones, for [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]] transmission, in [[radar]] and for [[satellite]] communication. {{As of|2012}} they were being studied for possible applications in [[field emission display]] technology, but there were significant production problems.

As of 2014, NASA's Ames Research Center was reported on working on vacuum-channel transistors produced using CMOS techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|title=The vacuum tube strikes back: NASA’s tiny 460GHz vacuum transistor that could one day replace silicon FETs|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/185027-the-vacuum-tube-strikes-back-nasas-tiny-460ghz-vacuum-transistor-that-could-one-day-replace-silicon-fets|publisher=ExtremeTech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''beam tetrode''', sometimes called  a &quot;'''beam power tube'''&quot;, is a type of [[tetrode]] [[vacuum tube]] (or 'valve') with auxiliary beam-focusing plates designed to augment power-handling capability and help reduce unwanted emission effects. These tubes are usually used for power [[amplifier|amplification]], especially at [[audio-frequency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MorrisPress1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher G. Morris|author2=Academic Press|title=Academic Press dictionary of science and technology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nauWlPTBcjIC&amp;pg=PA235|accessdate=6 April 2012|year=1992|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|isbn=978-0-12-200400-1|pages=235–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The problem of [[secondary emission]] from the anode in the tetrode tube was solved by [[Philips]]/[[Mullard]] with the introduction of a [[suppressor grid]] to produce the [[pentode]] construction.  Since Philips held a patent on this design, other manufacturers were keen to produce pentode type tubes without infringing the patent. In the UK, two [[EMI]] engineers, Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda, produced and patented an alternate design in 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan(A.M.I.O.A.)1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ben Duncan|author2=Ben Duncan (A.M.I.O.A.)|title=High Performance Audio Power Amplifiers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ma7qKuwH-nIC&amp;pg=PA402|accessdate=6 April 2012|date=8 November 1996|publisher=Newnes|isbn=978-0-7506-2629-3|pages=402–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their design had the following features (compared to the normal pentode).
* The [[control grid|control]] and [[screen grid]]s were wound so that the pitches were the same and the wires were in alignment (the pentode used different pitches).
* A pair of beam-forming plates was added at the two ends of the oval grid structure to focus the electron stream into a pair of beams 180 degrees apart (the pentode added a third grid). These plates are normally connected to the cathode.

The design is today known as the '''beam tetrode''' but historically was also known as a '''kinkless tetrode''', since it is a four-electrode device without the [[negative resistance]] kink in the anode current vs anode voltage characteristic curves of a true tetrode. Some authorities, notably outside the United Kingdom, argue that the beam plates constitute a fifth electrode.&lt;ref name=&quot;FallaJohnson2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeffrey Falla|author2=Aurora Johnson|title=How to Hot Rod Your Fender Amp: Modifying Your Amplifier for Magical Tone|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m5m8nCN1ZQEC&amp;pg=PT178|accessdate=6 April 2012|date=3 February 2011|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-3847-6|pages=178–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmosAmos1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanley William Amos|author2=Roger S. Amos|author3=Geoffrey William Arnold Dummer|title=Newnes Dictionary of Electronics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lROa-MpIrucC&amp;pg=PA318|accessdate=6 April 2012|year=1999|publisher=Newnes|isbn=978-0-7506-4331-3|pages=318–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EMI design had the following advantages over the pentode:

* The [[screen grid]] current was about 5-10% of the anode current compared with about 20% for the pentode, thus the beam tetrode was more power-efficient.
* The design introduced significantly less third-[[harmonic distortion]] into the signal than did the pentode.{{cn|date=January 2014}} 
* The design produced more output power than a similar pentode.

Disadvantages of the beam tetrode were:

* It had higher inherent [[intermodulation distortion]] than the pentode. It could be reduced by adopting an [[Ultra-Linear|ultra-linear]] design in a [[Push–pull output|push-pull]] circuit.  This connection links the screen grids to taps on the output [[transformer]]. [[Negative feedback]] also reduced harmonic and intermodulation distortion.
* The beam tetrode had smaller transconductance than a similar pentode and therefore required a larger input signal at the [[control grid]] for a given output power.
* The beam tetrode had more tendency to oscillate than a pentode if the circuit was not designed and laid out properly.{{cn|date=January 2014}} 

The MOV ([[Marconi-Osram Valve]]) company, under the joint ownership of [[EMI]] and [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]], considered the design too difficult to manufacture due to the need for good alignment of the grid wires. As MOV had a design-share agreement with [[RCA]] of America, the design was passed to that company. RCA had the resources to produce a workable design resulting in the [[6L6]]. Not long after, the beam tetrode appeared in a variety of offerings, including the [[6V6]] in December 1936, the MOV [[KT66]] in 1937 and the [[KT88]] in 1956, designed specifically for audio and highly prized by collectors today.

Some tubes described as pentodes are actually beam tetrodes. The ubiquitous Mullard [[EL34]] (6CA7), although manufactured by Mullard as a pentode, was also produced by other manufacturers as a beam tetrode instead.

A beam tetrode family widely used in the US comprised the [[25L6]], 35L6, and 50L6, and their miniature versions the 50B5 and 50C5. They were functionally identical to the 6L6 with the exception of the heater voltages.  They were used in millions of [[All American Five]] AM radio receivers. Most of these used a transformerless power supply circuit. In American radio receivers with transformer power supplies, built from about 1940-1950, the 6V6, 6V6G, 6V6GT and miniature 6AQ5 beam tetrodes were very commonly used.

In military equipment, the [[807 (vacuum tube)|807]], and 1625 with rated anode dissipations of 25 watts and operating from a supply of up to 750 volts, were in widespread use as the final amplifier in [[radio-frequency]] transmitters of up to 50 watts output power and in push-pull applications for audio. These tubes were very similar to a 6L6 but had a somewhat higher anode dissipation rating and the anode plate was connected to the top cap instead of a pin at the base. Large numbers entered the market after [[World War II]] and were used widely by radio amateurs in the USA and Europe through the 1950s and 1960s. 

The beam tetrode produces the lowest distortion of this class of tube by producing significantly less third-harmonic distortion, and lower [[intermodulation distortion]] when used in ultralinear mode.   Even-harmonic distortion is automatically cancelled in a push-pull design. The beam tetrode can be operated as a [[triode]] (by connecting its screen grid to its [[anode]]), and in this mode functions more efficiently than a pentode operated in the same manner.{{cn|date=January 2014}}

'''Amperex Electronic Corporation''' was a manufacturer of [[vacuum tube]]s and [[semiconductor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Knight (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brooklyn, New York ==
Originally located at 79 Washington Street in [[Brooklyn, New York]], Amperex was a long-established manufacturer of transmitting tubes when they were acquired by the Dutch firm, [[Philips]] around 1955. Philips continued to improve and enlarge the  tube plant in New York, but also used the Amperex name to distribute their new line of Dutch-made miniature tubes, ([[12AX7]], [[12AU7]], [[12AT7]]) to feed the booming U.S. [[High fidelity|hi-fi]] market. Classic hi-fi brands such as [[Marantz]], Fisher, and [[H. H. Scott, Inc.]], used these tubes. Amperex also produced the [[6DJ8]], 6922 and 7308 frame grid tubes. Developed by Amperex in 1958 when transistors were beginning to supplant tubes and originally developed for video and radar use, the 6DJ8 also excelled in audio amplifiers needing its high [[transconductance]], and it still has a niche market among [[audiophile]]s.

[[File:Amperex OA2.JPG|thumb|100px|right|A voltage regulator vacuum tube made by Amperex]]Amperex tubes were original equipment parts in many models of [[Tektronix]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]] test equipment. Although Amperex stopped making vacuum tubes long ago, hoards of [[new old stock]] (especially the original &quot;Bugle Boy&quot; series) are traded for profit, and other manufacturers produced compatible tubes more recently.

== Hicksville, New York ==
[[Image:Amperex Hicksville.jpg|thumb|Amperex facility in Hicksville, New York]]
A new factory was constructed at 230 Duffy Avenue, [[Hicksville, New York]], to manufacture electron tubes and semiconductors. Miniature receiving tubes, [[magnetron]]s, X-ray tubes, Geiger-Muller tubes, and large transmitting tubes were also manufactured at this location. This location became the headquarters for North American Philips (NAP). The factory was competed in 1953 and closed in 1989. All assets were then sold to Richardson Electronics of rural Lafox, near [[Batavia, Illinois]].

The Hicksville factory had a company-sponsored softball team that played at [[Eisenhower Park]] (then called Salisbury Park) in [[East Meadow, New York]].

== Slatersville, Rhode Island ==
[[Image:Ri1 Slatersville.jpg|thumb|Amperex facility in Slatersville, Rhode Island]]
[[Image:RI2 Slatersville.jpg|thumb|Amperex facility in Slatersville, Rhode Island]]
North American Philips Corporation built a {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} plant at 100 Providence Pike, [[North Smithfield, Rhode Island]] ([[Slatersville, Rhode Island|Slatersville]]) on a {{convert|15|acre|m2|sing=on}} plot in 1959. The 15-acre property is recorded by the Town of North Smithfield Tax Assessor as Lot No. 60 on Plat No. 4, and Lot No. 385 on Plat No. 5. There are five buildings located on the property. The property is bordered to the north by Industrial Drive; to the south by Comstock Road, to the east by a grassy area; and to the west by Providence Pike. The plant was operated by one of Philips' fully owned subsidiaries, Amperex Electronics, to supply [[IBM]], one of Philips' largest customers, with high speed, gold-doped [[germanium]] logic diodes. Millions of these diodes were manufactured at the Slatersville plant every year. With the advent of silicon diodes in 1962 there was a decreasing demand for these germanium diodes, so Philips transferred their germanium [[Alloy-junction transistor#Post-alloy diffused transistor|Post Alloy Diffused Transistor]] (PADT) manufacturing to Slatersville to take advantage of the site's capacity.

In 1960 Philips invented an imaging tube called the [[Video camera tube#Plumbicon|Plumbicon]] to replace the [[Video camera tube#Vidicon|vidicon]] and [[Video camera tube#Image orthicon|Image Orthicon]] tubes used in studio television cameras. The technical advantages of this new tube allowed true color fidelity to be seen in television broadcasts for the first time. In 1967 the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presented Philips with an [[Emmy Award]] for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development&quot; for the invention of the Plumbicon tube.

The popularity of the Plumbicon tubes was so great that Amperex, built a second plant adjacent to the 1959 building on the Slatersville site to meet the demand. The new plant was {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, and at the time of construction employed the largest and cleanest clean room facilities in the world. The plant was officially opened in 1967 and is still making Plumbicon camera tubes today. Although the original use of Plumbicon camera tubes was in broadcast television, current demand is primarily in for use in medical imaging equipment.

In 1973, several years after its acquisition by Amperex, the manufacturing operations of Advanced Micro Electronics were transferred to Slatersville. The products transferred from Advanced Micro Electronics included small signal silicon planar transistors for military and industrial applications, Leadless Inverted Devices (LIDs) and [[hybrid circuit]]s using both thin and thick film technology. Manufacturing of these three products and the sales office for Philips Semiconductors were housed in Slatersville until 1992 when this business unit was sold.

In 1998 Philips Components purchased, from English Electric Valve (EEV), the only other lead oxide camera tube business still in existence and so became the World's sole lead oxide camera tube manufacturer.

== Cranston, Rhode Island ==
[[Image:Cranston.jpg|thumb|Amperex facility in Cranston, Rhode Island]]
Amperex had a {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} manufacturing facility at 99 Bald Hill Road, [[Cranston, Rhode Island]], that manufactured monolithic integrated circuits . 
It was acquired by Micro Components Corporation, later renamed Cherry Semiconductor,  moved to 1900 South County Trl, East Greenwich, RI.  then sold to [[ON Semiconductor]], a subsidiary of Motorola until 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3595">The [[Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association]] was formed in 1953, as a result of mergers with other trade standards organisations.

It was principally responsible for the standardised [[nomenclature]] for American [[vacuum tubes]].

American made tubes bear a RETMA designation to allow for easy cross-referencing. The RETMA tube designation does not incorporate the purpose of each tube in the designation.  The Anglo-European [[Mullard-Philips tube designation]] does include tube use information in the designation.

*'''First figure group''': indicates heater/filament voltage; 0 means a [[Cold cathode#Cold-cathode devices|cold-cathode tube]]
* '''Letter group''': letter(s) indicate the serial order of assignment of the designation.
**Letters U, V, W, X, Y and Z are commonly used for rectifiers
**S as a first letter indicates single-ended tubes, related to grid-cap tubes.
**S as a second letter indicates single-ended tubes.
**Combinations like AB, AC, AD and AE were used when all the single letters were used up.
**L as a first letter often indicates a lock-in (Loktal) [[valve]].
**P as a second letter indicates a CRT.
**Wherever possible, the 12V equivalent of a 6V tube had the same letters, just 12 instead of 6.

::Occasionally the same letter groups were used for differing tubes but only where the last number would be different making the designation unique.  For example there is a 12AV5 (beam tetrode), 12AV6 (double diode, triode) and a 12AV7 (double triode).

* '''Second figure group''' is the number of useful elements (including the heater if this is separate from the cathode); in metal tubes the shell counts as one element. Internal shielding also counts, but base shielding does not.  Electrodes connected together internally are counted as one element.  There is an inconsistency in the way tapped heaters or filaments are counted.  For example, the 12BH7 (double triode with separate cathodes) counts the centre tapped heater as one useful element, whereas the 12BY7 (pentode) counts the centre tapped heater as two useful elements.  There are also inconsistencies in the way internal screens are treated.  In the 6BX6 (pentode with g3 brought to its own pin), the screen around the assembly is not counted, whereas the 6BR7 (also a pentode with g3 brought to its own pin) has its similar screen included.&lt;ref&gt;Brimar Radio Valve and Teletube Manual (Edition No. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a CRT, the second figure group indicates the type of [[phosphor]] the tube face was coated with.

'''Additional letters''':
*A,B,C  Improved backward compatible versions
*E 	Export version
*G 	[[Bulb|Glass bulb]], ST-12 to ST-16 size
*GT 	Glass bulb, T-9 size (actually 'Glass Tubular')
*GT/G 	Glass bulb, T-9 size interchangeable with G and GT types
*L 	Loktal
*LM 	Loktal-metal
*LT 	Locking base
*M 	Metal envelope
*MG 	Metal-glass
*ML 	Metal-Loktal
*S 	Spray shielded
*W 	Ruggedised, or military grade
*WA,WB 	Improved, backward compatible military/industrial variants
*X 	low loss ceramic base for HF use
*Y 	low loss phenolic (Micanol) base for HF use

In Europe, the principal method of numbering [[vacuum tubes]] (&quot;thermionic valves&quot;) was the nomenclature used by the  [[Philips]] company and its subsidiaries [[Mullard]] in the UK, [[Valvo]] in Germany, and [[Dario (brand)|Dario]] in France, from 1934. This system allocated meaningful codes to tubes based on their function.  This European common code system became the starting point for the [[Pro Electron]] naming scheme for active devices (including tubes and [[transistors]]).

==Nomenclature systems==
The system allowed for cross-referencing with the American [[RETMA tube designation]], the [[Marconi-Osram tube designation]], and with military numbering systems such as civilian valve (CV) numbering in the United Kingdom and the Joint Army–Navy (JAN) tube designation in the US. 

European tube manufacturers agreed on the system, but in the UK, MOV ([[Marconi-Osram Valve]]), [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC/Brimar]] and Mazda/[[Joseph Swan#Ediswan|Ediswan]] maintained their own systems. Most MOV tubes were cross-licensed copies of [[RCA]] types, with a British designation. For example an MOV X63 valve was the same as an RCA 6A8 tube. Brimar, which stood for &quot;British Manufactured American Radio&quot; (valves), used all American designations. STC/Brimar was a UK subsidiary of the American giant [[ITT Corporation|ITT]] (International Telephone and Telegraph).

Special quality tubes were sometimes identified by placing the numerical part of the designation between the heater rating and the tube type.  The special quality could be anything, from rugged designs for military and industrial use, through devices with exceptionally low noise and [[microphony]], to designs primarily optimised for long life without [[cathode poisoning]] when used for switching in a [[digital computer]] (but not necessarily with exceptional qualities as an amplifier). For example an ECC81 manufactured as a special quality (SQ) tube would usually be designated 'E81CC'.  The system was not universal as other special quality designation systems existed.  An EF91 in its special quality version was designated 'M8083' (the 'M' meant Military) as in this case the standard EF91 was derived from the M8083 military design. Also, the SQ tube was not always designed for the same tasks or given the same Maximum Ratings (for example the E80F was more suitable for audio and electrometer applications, lacking the RF screening of the EF80, with anode and screen grid power ratings roughly half the EF80.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.r-type.org/pdfs/e80f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation|reason=reference shows an E80F with an R.F. screen|date=November 2013}}

Two or more elements in a single envelope were handled by adding letters after the heater identifier, in alphabetical order, so an ECH35 is a 6.3 volt heated triode plus a hexode with an octal base; a PABC80 is a Noval 300mA series-heater combination of a single low-power diode A, a pair of diodes with common cathode B, and a triode C. There were many ECCnn(n) 6.3V dual triodes.

It was the usual practice for power transformers to have a 5 volt insulated winding for rectifier filaments, and a 6.3 volt winding for all the other heaters; virtually all valves with 5V filament are rectifiers with cathode connected to heater, in practice full-wave (usable as half-wave by strapping both anodes together), e.g. GZ34. For lower-voltage lower-power requirements, rectifiers with 6.3V heaters and insulated cathodes such as the EZ80 were used, connected to the common filament supply. There is no special nomenclature for [[Extra high tension|EHT]] rectifiers for [[cathode-ray tube]]s; the EY51 and EY86 were rated at 17kV with an average current of 350 microamps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aaa0415.htm The National Valve Museum: EY51]&lt;/ref&gt; The GY501 is another example (31kV at 1.7mA and used the rare B9D base).&lt;ref&gt;Mazda Data Book 1968&lt;/ref&gt; In practice most &quot;xY&quot; half-wave rectifiers are EHT types; but there are plenty of exceptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;TypeDesignationCode1967&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tubedata.info/other/TypeDesignationCode1967.pdf |title= Preferred Types of Electron Tubes 1967|format=PDF |accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Notes:'''
::For signal pentodes, an odd numerical identifier most often identified a variable transconductance (remote-cutoff) valve whereas an even number identified a 'high slope' (sharp-cutoff) valve.
::For power pentodes and triode-pentode combinations, even numbers usually indicate linear (audio power amplifier) devices while odd numbers were more suited to video signals or situations where more distortion could be tolerated.

=== Single-digit numbers ===

The first types assigned using this sequence (in the mid to late 1930's) were less systematic and sometimes would append the US &quot;G&quot; and/or &quot;GT&quot; suffixes for octal base versions, although the base type was not always knowable from just the type number:

* KK2 (Cap E) was a pinch-type valve fitted with an American 7-pin base.
* Sometimes special versions were made with US (Ux-4 to 7) bases with no change in the type number (e.g. AF2, AK1, KK2), but 
* in the case of [[Tube socket#Octal|Octal (IO)]] often a &quot;G&quot; would be appended to the type number; examples are ECH3G, ECH4G, EK2G, EK2G/GT, EL3G, EL3NG, KF3G, KK2G and KL4G.  
* EBF2Gm EBF2GT/G and EBF35 had International Octal bases but European base connection sequences.
* Versions without the pinch at the top and/or with a metal screen might have &quot;N&quot; appended, and letters &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; or &quot;X&quot; would sometimes be used for variants (e.g. AL2X, ECH33B, ECH35A, EL3N and EL3NG). The AL2X differs from the AL2 in connecting the control grid to pin 6 instead of the top cap.  EL33, EL33A and EL33B are octal power pentodes differing only in whether metallization shielding is connected to pin 1 or 8.
* The AL3, AL4, EL3N and EL3NG have identical characteristics to the EL33, EL33A and EL33B but with different heater voltages and/or bases; the CL4 and CL33 are lower voltage and lower power devices that are only somewhat similar to the EL33 and PL33.

=== Historical progression ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}

====The older Philips system====
Prior to 1934, Phillips numbers were based on a sequence of one letter to indicate filament current range, followed by one or two digits for the filament voltage, then two digits that gave either the amplification factor (for triodes) or a code beginning with 41 to indicate tetrodes, pentodes and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Miniwatt Technical Data, 6th Edition; 1958; Published by the &quot;Miniwatt&quot; Electronics Division of Philips Electrical Industries Pty. Limited, 20 Herbert Street, Artarmon, N,S,W., Australia&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples are:
* A409 (a 4Volt/65mA filament triode with a mu of 9) 
* B2043 (a 20V/180mA ''indirectly-heated'' power output pentode from 1931)
* C243N (a 2V/200mA filament power output pentode from 1931 with the option of B5 and Ux5 bases).

====Single-digit numerical sequences====
An example of this format is &quot;CL4&quot;. This format was used from 1934, when many European-specific bases existed.  These bases included  5- and 8-pin side-contact, and 4- to 7-pin alternatives to incompatible US base types.&lt;ref&gt;Miniwatt Technical Data, 6th Edition; 1958; Published by the &quot;Miniwatt&quot; Electronics Division of Philips Electrical Industries Pty. Limited, 20 Herbert Street, Artarmon, N,S,W., Australia&lt;/ref&gt; At this time there was pressure to produce devices compatible with wider markets, and so several versions of the same device might be produced with different bases, yet sometimes no change in type number.

====Double-digit numerical sequences ====
An example of this designation format is &quot;EL33A&quot;. After about 1938 the digits gave a more consistent definition of the base type. During the 1950s, most often two devices that shared the same number and all but the first letter of the name would be very similar except for heater voltage/current. During this time older filament voltage and current &quot;families&quot; were abandoned, so a device name beginning with &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; or &quot;K&quot; and ending in two or more digits is very unlikely to be part of this naming scheme. For example the &quot;KT61&quot; is not a 2 Volt-filament beam tube within the Philips naming system, but a &quot;kinkless tetrode&quot; within the Marconi/EMI naming scheme.

====Triple-digit numerical sequences ====
Examples of this format are &quot;PL302&quot; and &quot;EF183&quot;. From about the start of the 1960s an extra digit was needed for new devices. Either a digit '''1''' was inserted before the '''8''' or other base-defining digit (e.g. an EF184 is a Noval pentode), or a three-digit sequence was used. For example a PL500 is a power pentode in a Magnoval base.

====Four-digit numerical sequences ====
{{main|Pro Electron}}
Numbering using four digits were never issued under the Mullard-Philips scheme.  They were obtained from the successor scheme, Pro Electron.

==Semiconductors ==
Mullard initially handled semiconductor naming by using the &quot;O&quot; heater code (shifting &quot;Cold Cathode&quot; to a code of &quot;Z&quot;). From 1966 the new [[Pro Electron]] standard codified type numbers for solid-state active devices using initial letters &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; (rarely used heaters) for germanium, silicon and other semiconductors. Other letters were allocated for integrated circuits. Heater letters A, B, C, F, K, V and Y ceased to be allocated for electron tube devices. 

Most existing European valve type number allocations were compatible with the new system, but sometimes ambiguities could only be resolved by checking the digits in the name. For example, it might not immediately be obvious whether a (hypothetical) AD108 is a 4 volt power triode or a germanium power transistor; an AZ41 (still on sale in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;Philips Pocket Book, 1973, page 13&lt;/ref&gt;) might be thought to be a germanium [[Zener diode]] (although, with only 2 digits for the serial number, it was not really a valid Pro Electron designation). By the time of the introduction of the Pro Electron series most tube names started with either D, E, G, P or U, so confusion between the two systems was unlikely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5653">In the years 1942-1944, the '''Radio Manufacturers Association''' used a descriptive '''nomenclature system''' for industrial, transmitting, and special-purpose [[vacuum tubes]]. The numbering scheme was distinct from both the numbering schemes used for standard receiving tubes, and the existing transmitting tube numbering systems used previously, such as the &quot;800 series&quot; numbers originated by RCA and adopted by many others.

The system assigned numbers with the base form &quot;1A21&quot;, and this numbering scheme is occasionally referred to by tube collectors and historians as the &quot;1A21 system&quot;.

The first digit of the type number was 1-9, providing a rough indication of the filament/heater power rating (and therefore the overall power handling capabilities) of the tube. The assigned numbers were as follows:

*1-- No filament/heater, or cold cathode device
*2-- Up to 10 W
*3-- 10-20 W
*4-- 20-50 W
*5-- 50-100 W
*6-- 100-200 W
*7-- 200-500 W
*8-- 500W-1 kW
*9-- More than 1 kW

The second character was a letter broadly identifying the class of tube:

*A-- Single element ([[electrical ballast|ballast]], [[Iron-hydrogen resistor|barretter]])
*B-- Two-element device such as:
**[[Diode]]
**Transmit/receive tube (TR cell), cold-cathode water vapor discharge tube for use in [[radar]] systems, shorts the receiver input to protect it while the transmitter operates
**Anti-transmit/receive tube (ATR cell), cold-cathode water vapor discharge tube for use in radar systems, decouples the transmitter from the antenna while not operating, to prevent it from wasting received energy
**[[Spark gap]]
*C-- [[Triode]]
*D-- [[Tetrode]]
*E-- [[Pentode]] or beam power tetrode
*F-- [[Hexode]]
*G-- Heptode
*H-- Octode
*J-- Magnetically controlled types, usually incorporating a resonator (essentially, [[magnetron]]s)
*K-- Electrostatically controlled types, including a resonator ([[klystron]]s and [[inductive output tube]]s)
*L-- [[Vacuum capacitor]]s
*N-- Crystal [[rectifier]]s (This designation lived on as the &quot;N&quot; in the [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]/[[JEDEC]] ''EIA-370'' solid state device numbers standard, like [[2N2222]])
*P-- Photosensitive types ([[phototube]]s, [[photomultiplier]]s, [[video camera tube|camera tubes]], [[night vision device|image converters]])
*Q-- Resonant vacuum cavities 
*R-- [[Ignitron]]s and [[mercury arc rectifier]]s
*S-- Vacuum switches
*'''T''' [[Storage tube|Storage]], radial beam, and [[Beam deflection tube|deflection control]] tubes (no known examples assigned)
*V-- [[Flash tube]]s
*W-- [[Travelling wave tube]]
*X-- [[X-ray tube]]
*Y-- [[Thermionic converter]]


The last 2 digits were serially assigned, beginning with 21 to avoid possible confusion with receiving tubes or CRT phosphor designations.
Multiple section tubes (like the 3E29 or 8D21) are assigned a letter corresponding to ONE set of electrodes.

==Oddities==

Like all tube numbering systems, there are many inconsistencies between theory and practice. For example, there is no assigned letter code for cathode-ray tubes. Some unusual types received rather mundane sounding designations, based solely on electrode count, because there was no better place to put them. For example, the 2F21 is not an actual hexode, but a pattern generating monoscope tube. Some very exotic types received generic designators, even when there was a more appropriate designator available. For example the 2H21 &quot;phasitron&quot; phase modulator tube used in early FM broadcast transmitters was assigned an &quot;H&quot; (octode) designator, when it would have been a perfect candidate for the otherwise unused &quot;T&quot; category for deflection controlled tubes.

The first-digit filament/heater power rating confusingly gathers valves of widely-differing ratings. The 2G21 is a subminiature Triode-Hexode, with a maximum anode (plate) current of some 0.2 milliamps and a maximum voltage of 45 volts. The 2J42 Magnetron, with a power output of some 7 kilowatts, is rated for anode current of 4.5 amps (pulse peak) at anode voltage of 5,500 volts.

==Famous types==

Many of the &quot;1A21&quot; series are well known to collectors and restorers of WW2 vintage radio equipment. A short list of well-known or historic types numbered under this system:

*1N23--Silicon point contact diode used in early radar mixers.
*1P25--Infrared image converter used in WW2 [[night vision]] &quot;sniperscopes&quot;.
*2C39--&quot;Oilcan&quot; type planar triode.
*2C43--&quot;Lighthouse&quot; type planar triode.
*2D21--Miniature glass tetrode thyratron used in jukeboxes and computer equipment.
*2P23--Early image [[orthicon]] TV camera tube.
*3B28--Xenon half wave rectifier--ruggedized replacement for mercury vapor type 866.
*3E29--Dual beam power tube used in radar equipment--a pulse rated variant of the earlier 829B.
*4D21--VHF beam tetrode better known by [[Eimac]] commercial number 4-125A.
*5C22--Hydrogen [[thyratron]] for radar modulators.
*6C21--Triode radar modulator for &quot;hard tube&quot; pulsers.
*8D21--Internally water cooled dual tetrode used in early VHF TV transmitters.

This numbering system was abandoned in 1944 in favor of a non-descriptive numbering system of 4 digit numbers beginning with 5500. This new system persisted until the final days of tubes, with type numbers registered up into the 9000 series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6331">[[Vacuum tube]]s produced in the former [[Soviet Union]] - and in present-day Russia - carry their own unique designations. Some confusion has been created in 'translating' these designations as they use [[Cyrillic]] rather than Latin characters.

== Receiver tubes ==
In the 1950s a 5-element system ([[GOST]] 5461-59, later 13393-76) was adopted in the (then) [[Soviet Union]] for designating receiver [[thermionic valves|vacuum tubes]].

The '''1st element''' (from left to right) is (for receiving tubes) a number specifying filament voltage in volts (rounded off to the nearest whole number), or (for cathode-ray tubes) the screen diagonal or diameter in cm (rounded-off to the nearest whole number).

The '''2nd element is''' a [[Cyrillic]] character specifying the type of device:
**'''D''' (Russian: '''Д''') - diode, including damper diodes.
**'''H''' (Russian: '''Х''') - double diode.
**'''Ts''' (Russian: '''Ц''') - low-power rectifier ([[kenotron]]).
**'''S''' (Russian: '''С''') - [[triode]].
**'''N''' (Russian: '''Н''') - double triode.
**'''E''' (Russian: '''Э''') - [[tetrode]].
**'''P''' (Russian: '''П''') - output [[pentode]], or a [[beam tetrode]].
**'''Zh''' (Russian: '''Ж''') - sharp-cutoff [[pentode]]. (also transliterated sh or j)
**'''K''' (Russian: '''К''') - variable-mu / remote-cutoff [[pentode]].
**'''R''' (Russian: '''Р''') - double [[pentode]] or a double [[tetrode]].
**'''G''' (Russian: '''Г''') - combined triode-diode.
**'''B''' (Russian: '''Б''') - combined diode-pentode.
**'''F''' (Russian: '''Ф''') - combined triode-pentode.
**'''I''' (Russian: '''И''') - combined triode-hexode, triode-heptode or triode-octode.
**'''A''' (Russian: '''А''') - [[pentagrid converter]].
**'''V''' (Russian: '''В''') - vacuum tube with secondary emission.
**'''L''' (Russian: '''Л''') - [[cathode-ray tube]].
**'''Ye''' (Russian: '''Е''') - [[magic eye tube|&quot;magic eye&quot; tube]] (e.g. used as a tuning indicator).

The '''3rd element''' is a number - a series designator that differentiates between different devices of the same type.

The '''4th element''' denotes vacuum tube construction (base, envelope):
**'''P''' (Russian: '''П''') - small 9-pin or 7-pin glass envelope (22.5 or 19&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter).
**'''A''' (Russian: '''А''') - subminiature glass envelope (5 to 8&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) with flexible leads.
**'''B''' (Russian: '''Б''') - subminiature glass envelope (8 to 10.2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) with flexible leads.
**'''S''' (Russian: '''С''') - glass envelope (greater than 22.5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter), typically with an [[Tube socket#Octal|octal base]].
**'''N''' (Russian: '''Н''') - [[nuvistor]].
**'''K''' (Russian: '''К''') - metal-ceramic envelope.
**'''D''' (Russian: '''Д''') - glass-metal envelope with disc connections (for UHF operation).

For all-metal tubes the '''4th element''' is omitted.

The '''5th element''' is optional. It consists of a dash (&quot;-&quot;) followed by a single character or a combination of characters, and denotes special characteristics (if any) of the tube:
**'''V''' (Russian: '''В''') - increased reliability and mechanical ruggedness (such as low susceptibility to noise and microphonics).
**'''R''' (Russian: '''Р''') - even better than V
**'''Ye''' (Russian: '''Е''') - extended service life.
**'''D''' (Russian: '''Д''') - exceptionally long service life.
**'''I''' (Russian: '''И''') - optimised for &quot;pulsed&quot; (i.e. switching) mode of operation.

For instance, '''-YeV''' (Russian: '''-ЕВ''') added after [[6N2P]] (i.e. '''6Н2П-ЕВ''') signifies that this variant of the 6N2P has extended service life and low noise and microphonics.  More often than not this means actual differences in internal construction of the tube compared to the &quot;basic&quot; type, but sometimes designators like '''-V''' and '''-I''' simply mean that the tube was specially selected for those characteristics from the regular-quality production at the factory.

The new designation convention was applied retrospectively to many of the previously produced types as well as to those produced afterwards.  For example, a Soviet-produced copy of the [[6L6]] was originally manufactured in the 1940s under its American designation (in Latin lettering), or sometimes a Cyrillic transcription of it, '''6Л6'''.  Under the above convention the tube was redesignated '''6P3S''' (Russian: '''6П3С'''). The [[6V6]] tube became '''6P6S''' (Russian: '''6П6С'''). However, many specialised Russian tubes, such as special military or transmitter tubes, do not follow the above convention.

Some of the better-known Russian equivalents of West European and American tubes are the '''6P14P''' (Russian:  '''6П14П'''), an [[EL84]]; '''6N8S''' (Russian: '''6Н8С'''), a [[6SN7]]; and 6P3S-E (Russian: '''6П3С-Е'''), a version of the [[6L6]].

== Transmitter tubes ==
There is another designation system for high-power tubes such as transmitter ones.

The '''1st element''' (from left to right) is always G (Russian Г, for &quot;generatornaya&quot;).

The '''2nd element''' (with some notable exceptions such as the Г807) is:
**'''K''' (Russian: '''К''') - shortwave (&lt;= 25&amp;nbsp;MHz) tube.
**'''U''' (Russian: '''У''') - ultra-shortwave (25-600&amp;nbsp;MHz) tube.
**'''S''' (Russian: '''С''') - centimetric-wavelength (&gt; 600&amp;nbsp;MHz) tube.
**'''M''' (Russian: '''М''') - modulator tube.
**'''I''' (Russian: '''И''') - impulse tube.

The '''3rd element''' consists of a dash (&quot;-&quot;) followed by the design serial number. Letter can be used here in some special cases (ГМИ-6 - impulse modulator); if the tube has to be force-cooled there might follow a letter 'A' (Russian 'А') for water-cooled or 'B' (Russian 'Б') for air-cooled. 

Popular transmitter tubes include the ГУ-29, ГУ-50, ГМ-70 and Г-807 (the Russian 807 analogue).

'''EI Niš''', short for Electronic Industry Niš (Elektronska industrija Niš) is a company with headquarters in [[Niš]], [[Serbia]]. It originated in 1948 from the foundation of the Institute for the Production of Radio Sets and Roentgen Machines, &quot;RR Niš.&quot; In 1970-s and 1980-s it was one of the greatest [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] companies employing over 10 thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ei Niš odlazi u stečaj|url=http://www.capital.ba/ei-nis-odlazi-u-stecaj/|website=capital.ba|accessdate=20 June 2014|language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 1990-s most of the company business collapsed, due to lack of investing in research and sanctions the country was facing.

Today, the company makes acoustic equipment, electronic tubes including cathode-ray tubes, printed plates, electronic machine elements, [[hydraulics]], [[pneumatics]], appliances, air-conditioners, medical equipment, roentgen machines, TV sets, radio receivers, and semiconductors. The company is also one of the few remaining makers of electronic [[vacuum tube]]s.

Until recently, the company was one of the few in the world to produce electronic tubes.

==Planned investments==
Inside industrial complex known as Electronic Industry Niš will be founded the first factory of [[Hematology|Hematology reagents]] in Serbia. The First Serbian Factory of [[Hematology]] reagents and Hematology instruments will be built until end or 2012.
 
New production facility founded and run by [http://www.reagentsandanalyzers.com/ NeoMedica] company from [[Niš]], will also be producing test devices for basic [[Urine analysis]] and different [[In vitro diagnostics|IVD]] products on several installed product lines.
 
This will be one more company newly founded or rebuilt inside industrial complex known as Electronic Industry Niš (shorten EI Nis).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29345">In [[solid-state physics]], the '''work function''' (sometimes spelled '''workfunction''') is the minimum [[thermodynamic work]] (i.e. energy) needed to remove an [[electron]] from a solid to a point in the [[vacuum]] immediately outside the solid surface. Here &quot;immediately&quot; means that the final electron position is far from the surface on the atomic scale, but still too close to the solid to be influenced by ambient electric fields in the vacuum.
The work function is not a characteristic of a bulk material, but rather a property of the surface of the material (depending on crystal face and contamination).

== Definition ==

The work function {{math|''W''}} for a given surface is defined by the difference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Solid State Physics |edition=7th |last1=Kittel |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Kittel |date= &lt;!--replace this comment with the publication year--&gt; |publisher=Wiley }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;W = -e\phi - E_{\rm F}, &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|−''e''}} is the charge of an [[electron]], {{math|''ϕ''}} is the [[electrostatic potential]] in the vacuum nearby the surface, and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Fermi level]] ([[electrochemical potential]] of electrons) inside the material. The term {{math|−''eϕ''}} is the energy of an electron at rest in the vacuum nearby the surface, and the meaning of the term {{math|−''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[thermodynamic work]] required to remove an electron from the material to a state of zero total energy. In words, the work function is thus defined as the thermodynamic work required to remove an electron from the material to a state at rest in the vacuum nearby the surface.

[[File:Work function mismatch gold aluminum.svg|thumb|300 px|Plot of electron energy levels against position, in a gold-vacuum-aluminium system. The two metals depicted here are in complete thermodynamic equilibrium. However, the vacuum [[electrostatic potential]] {{math|''ϕ''}} is not flat due to a difference in work function.]]

In practice, one directly controls {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} by the voltage applied to the material through electrodes, and the work function is generally a fixed characteristic of the surface material. Consequently, this means that when a voltage is applied to a material, the electrostatic potential {{math|''ϕ''}} produced in the vacuum will be somewhat lower than the applied voltage, the difference depending on the work function of the material surface. Rearranging the above equation, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = V - \frac{W}{e}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''V'' {{=}} −''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/''e''}} is the voltage of the material (as measured by a [[voltmeter]], through an attached electrode), relative to an [[electrical ground]] that is defined as having zero Fermi level. The fact that {{math|''ϕ''}} depends on material surface means that the space between two dissimilar conductors will have a built-in [[electric field]], even when those conductors are in total equilibrium with each other (electrically shorted to each other, and with equal temperatures). An example of this situation is depicted in the adjacent figure. As described in the next section, these built-in vacuum electric fields can have important consequences in some cases.

== Applications ==

* ''[[Thermionic emission]]'': In thermionic [[electron gun]]s, the work function and temperature of the [[hot cathode]] are critical parameters in determining the amount of current that can be emitted. [[Tungsten]], the common choice for vacuum tube filaments, can survive to high temperatures but its emission is somewhat limited due to its relatively high work function (approximately 4.5 eV). By coating the tungsten with a substance of lower work function (e.g., [[thorium]] or [[barium oxide]]), the emission can be greatly increased. This prolongs the lifetime of the filament by allowing operation at lower temperatures (for more information, see [[hot cathode]]).

* ''[[Band bending]] models in solid-state electronics'': The behavior of a solid-state device is strongly dependent on the size of various [[Schottky barrier]]s and [[heterojunction|band offset]]s in the junctions of differing materials, such as metals, semiconductors, and insulators. Some commonly used heuristic approaches to predict the band alignment between materials, such as [[Anderson's rule]] and the [[Schottky-Mott rule]], are based on the thought experiment of two materials coming together in vacuum, such that the surfaces charge up and adjust their work functions to become equal just before contact. In reality these work function heuristics are inaccurate due to their neglect of numerous microscopic effects. However. they provide a convenient estimate until the true value can be determined by experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Kroemer]], &quot;[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/kroemer-lecture.html Quasi-Electric Fields and Band Offsets: Teaching Electrons New Tricks]&quot; Nobel lecture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/physics/tung/Schottky/systematics.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Equilibrium electric fields in vacuum chambers'': Variation in work function between different surfaces causes a non-uniform electrostatic potential in the vacuum. Even on an ostensibly uniform surface, variations in {{math|''W''}} known as patch potentials are always present due to microscopic inhomogeneities.

* ''[[Contact electrification]]'': If two conducting surfaces are moved relative to each other, and there is potential difference in the space between them, then an electric current will be driven. This is because the [[surface charge]] on a conductor depends on the magnitude of the electric field, which in turn depends on the distance between the surfaces. The externally observed electrical effects are largest when the conductors are separated by the smallest distance without touching (once brought into contact, the charge will instead flow internally through the junction between the conductors). Since two conductors in equilibrium can have a built-in potential difference due to work function differences, this means that bringing dissimilar conductors into contact, or pulling them apart, will drive electric currents. These contact currents can damage sensitive microelectronic circuitry and occur even when the conductors would be grounded in the absence of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomas Iii | first1 = S.

== Measurement ==

Certain physical phenomena are highly sensitive to the value of the work function.
The observed data from these effects can be fitted to simplified theoretical models, allowing one to extract a value of the work function.
These phenomenologically extracted work functions may be slightly different from the thermodynamic definition given above.
For inhomogeneous surfaces, the work function varies from place to place, and different methods will yield different values of the typical &quot;work function&quot; as they average or select differently among the microscopic work functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitfalls&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Helander | first1 = M.

Many techniques have been developed based on different physical effects to measure the electronic work function of a sample. One may distinguish between two groups of experimental methods for work function measurements: absolute and relative.

* Absolute methods employ electron emission from the sample induced by photon absorption (photoemission), by high temperature (thermionic emission), due to an electric field ([[field electron emission]]), or using [[quantum tunneling|electron tunnelling]].

* Relative methods make use of the [[contact potential difference]] between the sample and a reference electrode. Experimentally, either an anode current of a diode is used or the displacement current between the sample and reference, created by an artificial change in the capacitance between the two, is measured (the [[Kelvin probe force microscope|Kelvin Probe]] method, [[Kelvin probe force microscope]]).

=== Methods based on thermionic emission ===

The work function is important in the theory of [[thermionic emission]], where thermal fluctuations provide enough energy to &quot;evaporate&quot; electrons out of a hot material (called the 'emitter') into the vacuum. If these electrons are absorbed by another, cooler material (called the ''collector'') then a measurable [[electric current]] will be observed. Thermionic emission can be used to measure the work function of both the hot emitter and cold collector. Generally, these measurement involve fitting to [[Richardson's law]], and so they must be carried out in a low temperature and low current regime where [[space charge]] effects are absent.

==== Work function of hot electron emitter ====
[[File:Thermionic diode forward bias.svg|thumb|300px|Energy level diagrams for [[thermionic diode]] in ''forward bias'' configuration, used to extract all hot electrons coming out from the emitter's surface. The barrier is the vacuum near emitter surface.]]

In order to move from the hot emitter to the vacuum, an electron's energy must exceed the emitter Fermi level by an amount
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm barrier} = W_{\rm e}&lt;/math&gt;
determined simply by the thermionic work function of the emitter.
If an electric field is applied towards the surface of the emitter, then all of the escaping electrons will be accelerated away from the emitter and absorbed into whichever material is applying the electric field.
According to [[Richardson's law]] the emitted [[current density]] (per unit area of emitter), ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), is related to the absolute [[temperature]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of the emitter by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;J_{\rm e} = -A_{\rm e} T_{\rm e}^2 e^{-E_{\rm barrier} / k T_{\rm e}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and the proportionality constant ''A''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Richardson's constant]] of the emitter.
In this case, the dependence of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; can be fitted to yield ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.

==== Work function of cold electron collector ====
[[File:Thermionic diode reverse bias.svg|thumb|300px|Energy level diagrams for [[thermionic diode]] in ''retarding potential'' configuration. The barrier is the vacuum near collector surface.]]

The same setup can be used to instead measure the work function in the collector, simply by adjusting the applied voltage.
If an electric field is applied ''away from'' the emitter instead, then most of the electrons coming from the emitter will simply be reflected back to the emitter. Only the highest energy electrons will have enough energy to reach the collector, and the height of the potential barrier in this case depends on the collector's work function, rather than the emitter's.

The current is still governed by Richardson's law. However, in this case the barrier height is does not depend on ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;. The barrier height now depends on the work function of the collector, as well as any additional applied voltages:&lt;ref&gt;G.L. Kulcinski, &quot;Thermionic Energy
Conversion&quot; [http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/SPRING00/lecture9.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm barrier} = W_{\rm c} - e (\Delta V_{\rm ce} - \Delta V_{\rm S})&lt;/math&gt;
where ''W''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the collector's thermionic work function, ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt; is the applied collector–emitter voltage, and ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Seebeck effect|Seebeck voltage]] in the hot emitter (the influence of ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is often omitted, as it is a small contribution of order 10 mV).
The resulting current density ''J''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; through the collector (per unit of collector area) is again given by [[Richardson's Law]], except now
:&lt;math&gt;J_{\rm c} = A T_{\rm e}^2 e^{-E_{\rm barrier}/kT_{\rm e}} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is a Richardson-type constant that depends on the collector material but may also depend on the emitter material, and the diode geometry.
In this case, the dependence of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, or on ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt;, can be fitted to yield ''W''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.

This '''retarding potential method''' is one of the simplest and oldest methods of measuring work functions, and is advantageous since the measured material (collector) is not required to survive high temperatures.

=== Methods based on photoemission ===

[[File:Photoelectric diode forward bias.svg|thumb|300 px|Photoelectric diode in ''forward bias'' configuration, used for measuring the work function ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of the illuminated emitter.]]

The photoelectric work function is the minimum [[photon]] energy required to liberate an electron from a substance, in the [[photoelectric effect]].
If the photon's energy is greater than the substance's work function, [[photoelectric effect|photoelectric emission]] occurs and the electron is liberated from the surface.
Similar to the thermionic case described above, the liberated electrons can be extracted into a collector and produce a detectable current, if an electric field is applied into the surface of the emitter.
Excess photon energy results in a liberated electron with non-zero kinetic energy.
It is expected that the minimum [[photon energy]] &lt;math&gt; \hbar \omega &lt;/math&gt; required to liberate an electron (and generate a current) is 
:&lt;math&gt;\hbar \omega = W_{\rm e} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''W''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the work function of the emitter.

Photoelectric measurements require a great deal of care, as an incorrectly designed experimental geometry can result in an erroneous measurement of work function.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitfalls&quot;/&gt; This may be responsible for the large variation in work function values in scientific literature.
Moreover, the minimum energy can be misleading in materials where there are no actual electron states at the Fermi level that are available for excitation. For example, in a semiconductor the minimum photon energy would actually correspond to the [[valence band]] edge rather than work function.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virginia.edu/ep/SurfaceScience/PEE.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, the photoelectric effect may be used in the retarding mode, as with the thermionic apparatus described above. In the retarding case, the dark collector's work function is measured instead.

=== Kelvin probe method ===
{{see also|Volta potential|Kelvin probe force microscope}}

[[File:Kelvin probe setup at flat vacuum.svg|thumb|300 px|Kelvin probe energy diagram at flat vacuum configuration, used for measuring work function difference between sample and probe.]]

The Kelvin probe technique relies on the detection of an electric field (gradient in ''ϕ'') between a sample material and probe material.
The electric field can be varied by the voltage ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; that is applied to the sample relative to the probe.
If the voltage is chosen such that the electric field is eliminated (the flat vacuum condition), then
:&lt;math&gt;e\Delta V_{\rm sp} = W_{\rm s} - W_{\rm p}, \quad \text{when}~\phi~\text{is flat}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since the experimenter controls and knows ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;, then finding the flat vacuum condition gives directly the work function difference between the two materials.
The only question is, how to detect the flat vacuum condition?
Typically, the electric field is detected by varying the distance between the sample and probe. When the distance is changed but ''ΔV''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; is held constant, a current will flow due to the change in [[capacitance]]. This current is proportional to the vacuum electric field, and so when the electric field is neutralized no current will flow.

Although the Kelvin probe technique only measures a work function difference, it is possible to obtain an absolute work function by first calibrating the probe against a reference material (with known work function) and then using the same probe to measure a desired sample.
The Kelvin probe technique can be used to obtain work function maps of a surface with extremely high spatial resolution, by using a sharp tip for the probe (see [[Kelvin probe force microscope]]).

== Physical factors that determine the work function ==

Due to the complications described in the modelling section below, it is difficult to theoretically predict the work function with accuracy. Various trends have, however, been identified. The work function tends to be smaller for metals with an open lattice, and larger for metals in which the atoms are closely packed. It is somewhat higher on dense crystal faces than open crystal faces, also depending on [[surface reconstruction]]s for the given crystal face.

=== Surface dipole ===

The work function is not simply dependent on the &quot;internal vacuum level&quot; inside the material (i.e., its average electrostatic potential), because of the formation of an atomic-scale [[Double layer (interfacial)|electric double layer]] at the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;venables&quot;/&gt; This surface electric dipole gives a jump in the electrostatic potential between the material and the vacuum.

A variety of factors are responsible for the surface electric dipole. Even with a completely clean surface, the electrons can spread slightly into the vacuum, leaving behind a slightly positively charged layer of material. This primarily occurs in metals, where the bound electrons do not encounter a hard wall potential at the surface but rather a gradual ramping potential due to [[image charge]] attraction. The amount of surface dipole depends on the detailed layout of the atoms at the surface of the material, leading to the variation in work function for different crystal faces.

=== Doping and electric field effect (semiconductors) ===

[[File:Semiconductor vacuum junction.svg|thumb|[[Band diagram]] of semiconductor-vacuum interface showing [[electron affinity]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;EA&lt;/sub&gt;, defined as the difference between near-surface vacuum energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;vac&lt;/sub&gt;, and near-surface [[conduction band]] edge ''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. Also shown: [[Fermi level]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, [[valence band]] edge ''E''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, work function ''W''.]]

In a [[semiconductor]], the work function is sensitive to the [[doping (semiconductor)|doping level]] at the surface of the semiconductor. Since the doping near the surface can also be [[field effect (semiconductor)|controlled by electric fields]], the work function of a semiconductor is also sensitive to the electric field in the vacuum.

The reason for the dependence is that, typically, the vacuum level and the conduction band edge retain a fixed spacing independent of doping. This spacing is called the [[electron affinity]] (note that this has a different meaning than the electron affinity of chemistry); in silicon for example the electron affinity is 4.05 eV.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virginiasemi.com/pdf/generalpropertiessi62002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; If the electron affinity ''E''&lt;sub&gt;EA&lt;/sub&gt; and the surface's band-referenced Fermi level ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;-''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; are known, then the work function is given by
:&lt;math&gt; W = E_{\rm EA} + E_{\rm C} - E_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is taken at the surface.

From this one might expect that by doping the bulk of the semiconductor, the work function can be tuned. In reality, however, the energies of the bands near the surface are often pinned to the Fermi level, due to the influence of [[surface state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/physics/tung/Schottky/surface.htm&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a large density of surface states, then the work function of the semiconductor will show a very weak dependence on doping or electric field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bardeen | first1 = J. | title = Surface States and Rectification at a Metal Semi-Conductor Contact | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.71.717 | journal = Physical Review | volume = 71 | issue = 10 | pages = 717 | year = 1947 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1947PhRv...71..717B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical models of metal work functions ===

&lt;!-- resource: http://venables.asu.edu/qmms/PROJ/metal1a.html --&gt;

Theoretical modelling of the work function is difficult, as an accurate model requires a careful treatment of both electronic [[many-body problem|many body effects]] and [[surface chemistry]]; both of these topics are already complex in their own right.

One of the earliest successful models for metal work function trends was the [[jellium]] model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = N. | last2 = Kohn | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.3.1215 | title = Theory of Metal Surfaces: Work Function | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 1215 | year = 1971 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1971PhRvB...3.1215L }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed for oscillations in electronic density nearby the abrupt surface (these are similar to [[Friedel oscillation]]s) as well as the tail of electron density extending outside the surface. This model showed why the density of conduction electrons (as represented by the [[Wigner-Seitz radius]] ''r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') is an important parameter in determining work function.

The jellium model is only a partial explanation, as its predictions still show significant deviation from real work functions. More recent models have focussed on including more accurate forms of [[electron exchange]] and correlation effects, as well as including the crystal face dependence (this requires the inclusion of the actual atomic lattice, something that is neglected in the jellium model).&lt;ref name=&quot;venables&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9780080536347 | title = Metal Surface Electron Physics | last1 = Kiejna | first1 = A. | last2 = Wojciechowski | first2 = K.F. | date = 1996 | publisher = Elsevier  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electron behaviour in metals varies with temperature and is largely reflected by the electron work function. A recent theoretical model explains the underlying mechanism and predicts this temperature dependence for various crystal structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rahemi|first1=Reza|last2=Li|first2=Dongyang|title=Variation in electron work function with temperature and its effect on the Young’s modulus of metals|journal=Scripta Materialia|date=April 2015|volume=99|pages=41–44|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2014.11.022|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135964621400493X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beam deflection tubes''' are [[vacuum tube]]s with an [[electron gun]], a beam intensity control grid, a screen grid, sometimes a suppressor grid, and two electrostatic deflection electrodes on opposite sides of the electron beam, that can direct the rectangular beam to either of two anodes in the same plane. They can be used as two-quadrant, single-balanced [[Frequency mixer|mixer]]s or (de)modulators with very linear qualities, their mode of operation similar to one-half of a [[Gilbert Cell]], by applying an [[unbalanced line|unbalanced]] signal f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to the control grid, and a [[balanced line|balanced]] signal f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the deflection electrodes, then extracting the balanced mixing products f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the two anodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzetfsqh/RCA_Review_7360.pdf|title=A new miniature beam deflection tube|author=M.

Two beam deflection tubes can be combined to form a double-balanced mixer.

They need extensive shielding against external magnetic fields. The [[ballistic transistor]]s currently under development employ a similar principle.

[[File:KN2KrytronTube.jpg|thumb|upright|KN2 &quot;Krytron&quot; switch tube, made by [[EG&amp;G]] (about 25 mm tall)]]
The '''krytron''' is a [[cold-cathode]] [[gas-filled tube]] intended for use as a very high-speed [[switch]], somewhat similar to the [[thyratron]]. It consists of a sealed glass tube with four [[electrode]]s. A small triggering pulse on the [[control grid|grid]] electrode switches the tube on, allowing a large current to flow between the [[cathode]] and [[anode]] electrodes. The vacuum version is called a '''vacuum krytron''', or '''sprytron'''. Krytron was one of the earliest developments of the [[EG&amp;G Corporation]].

==Description==
Unlike most other gas switching tubes, the krytron conducts by means of an [[electric arc|arc discharge]], to handle very high voltages and currents (reaching several kilovolts and several kiloamperes), rather than the low-current [[electric glow discharge|glow discharge]] used in other [[thyratron]]s.  The krytron is a development of the [[Spark gap|triggered spark gap]]s and [[thyratron]]s originally developed for [[radar]] transmitters during [[World War II]].

The gas used in krytrons is [[hydrogen]];&lt;ref name=&quot;ch4&quot;&gt;&quot;Trapping Low Energy in an Ion Trap&quot; Harvard Ph.D. Thesis of Xiang Fei (Defended 10 May 1990), [http://hussle.harvard.edu/~gabrielse/gabrielse/papers/1990/1990_fei/chapter_4.pdf Chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt; [[noble gas]]es (usually [[krypton]], or a [[Penning mixture]]) can also be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconinvestigations.com/KRYT/Krytron.HTM Silicon Investigations Pulse Power Switching &amp; EG&amp;G Krytron Tube Replacement Page]. Siliconinvestigations.com (2010-02-22). Retrieved on 2010-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Krytron.svg|left|200px|Diagram of a Krytron]]
Krytron has four [[electrode]]s.  Two are conventional [[anode]] and [[cathode]].  One is a keep-alive electrode, arranged to be close to the cathode.  The keep-alive has a low positive voltage applied, which causes a small area of gas to ionize near the cathode.  High voltage is applied to the anode, but primary conduction does not occur until a positive pulse is applied to the trigger electrode (&quot;Grid&quot; in the image above).  Once started, arc conduction carries a considerable current.  

The control grid is usually wrapped around the anode, except a small opening on its top.&lt;ref name=&quot;tubecol&quot;/&gt;

In place of or in addition to the keep-alive electrode some krytrons may contain a very tiny amount of radioactive material (usually less than 5 micro[[curie]]s of [[nickel|nickel-63]]), which emits [[beta particle]]s (high-speed [[electron]]s) to make [[ionization]] easier. The radiation source serves to increase the reliability of ignition and formation of the keep-alive electrode discharge.

The gas filling provides ions for neutralizing the [[space charge]] and allowing high currents at lower voltage.&lt;ref name=&quot;tubecol&quot;&gt;[http://www.tubecollector.org/krytron.htm Krytron information on ''Tube Collector'' site]&lt;/ref&gt; The keep-alive discharge populates the gas with ions, forming a preionized plasma; this can shorten the arc formation time by 3–4 orders of magnitude in comparison with non-preionized tubes, as time does not have to be spent on ionizing the medium during formation of the arc path.&lt;ref name=&quot;pulse&quot;/&gt;

The electric arc is self-sustaining; once the tube is triggered, it conducts until the arc is interrupted by the current falling too low for too long (under 10 milliamperes for more than 100 microseconds for the KN22 krytrons).&lt;ref name=&quot;ch4&quot;/&gt;

Krytrons and sprytrons are triggered by a high voltage from a [[capacitor]] discharge via a trigger [[transformer]], in a similar way [[flashtube]]s for e.g. [[photoflash]] applications are triggered. Devices integrating a krytron with a trigger transformer are available.&lt;ref name=&quot;pulse&quot;/&gt;

===Sprytron===
'''Sprytron''', also known as '''vacuum krytron''', is a vacuum, rather than gas-filled, version. It is designed for use in environments with high levels of [[ionizing radiation]], which might trigger a gas-filled krytron spuriously.

Sprytrons lack the keepalive electrode and the preionization radioactive source. The trigger pulse for the grid must be stronger than for a krytron. Sprytrons are able to handle higher currents; krytrons tend to be used for triggering a secondary switch, e.g., a triggered spark gap, while sprytrons are usually connected directly to the load.

The trigger pulse has to be much more intense, as there is no preionized gas path for the electric current, and a [[vacuum arc]] must form between the cathode and anode. An arc first forms between the cathode and the grid, then a breakdown occurs between the cathode–grid conductive region and the anode.&lt;ref name=&quot;pulse&quot;&gt;[http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/pulse.html#krytron Pulse Power Switching Devices]. Electricstuff.co.uk. Retrieved on 2010-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprytrons are evacuated to [[Vacuum#Measurement|hard vacuum]]. As [[Kovar]] and other metals are somewhat permeable for hydrogen, especially during the 600&amp;nbsp;°C [[bake-out]] before evacuation and sealing, all external metal surfaces have to be plated with thick (25 micrometers or more) layer of soft [[gold]]. The same metallization is used for other switch tubes as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconinvestigations.com/KRYT/Sprytron.pdf Evaluation of non-cyanide gold plating process for switch tubes], Sandia Report, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprytrons can be also triggered by a [[laser]] pulse. In 1999 the laser pulse energy needed to trigger a sprytron was reduced to 10 microjoules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/nuke-stockpile.htm Stockpile Stewardship and Management ? United States Nuclear Forces]. Globalsecurity.org. Retrieved on 2010-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprytrons are usually manufactured as rugged metal/[[ceramic]] parts. They typically have low [[inductance]] (10 nano[[henry (unit)|henries]]) and low electrical resistance when switched on (10–30 milli[[ohm]]s). After triggering, just before the sprytron switches fully on in avalanche mode, it briefly becomes slightly conductive (100–200 amperes); high-power [[MOSFET]] transistors operating in avalanche mode show similar behavior. [[SPICE]] models for sprytrons are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10170107-jiZVdO/native/10170107.pdf Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information – Sponsored by OSTI]. Osti.gov (2010-05-28). Retrieved on 2010-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
This design, dating from the late 1940s, is still capable of pulse-power performance that even the most advanced semiconductors (even [[IGBT]]s) cannot match easily. Krytrons and sprytrons are capable of handling high-current high-voltage pulses, with very fast switching times, and constant, low [[jitter]] time delay between application of the trigger pulse and switching on.

Krytrons can switch currents of up to about 3000 amperes and voltages up to about 5000 volts. Commutation time of less than 1 nanosecond can be achieved, with a delay between the application of the trigger pulse and switching as low as about 30 nanoseconds. The achievable jitter may be below 5 nanoseconds. The required trigger pulse voltage is about 200–2000 volts; higher voltages decrease the switching delay to some degree. The switching delay is strongly independent on the environment. Commutation time can be somewhat shortened by increasing the trigger pulse rise time. A given krytron tube will give very consistent performance to identical trigger pulses (low jitter).&lt;ref name=&quot;pulse&quot;/&gt; The keep-alive current ranges from tens to hundreds of microamperes. The pulse repetition rate can range from one per minute to tens of thousands per minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;tubecol&quot;/&gt;

Switching performance is largely independent of the environment (temperature, acceleration, vibration, etc.). However, the formation of the keep-alive glow discharge is more sensitive, which necessitates the use of a radioactive source to aid its ignition.

Krytrons have a limited lifetime, ranging, according to type, typically from tens of thousands to tens of millions of switching operations, and sometimes only a few hundreds.&lt;ref name=&quot;tubecol&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pulse&quot;/&gt;

Sprytrons have somewhat faster switching times than krytrons.

Hydrogen-filled thyratrons may be used as a replacement in some applications.

==Applications==
Krytrons and their variations are manufactured by [[Perkin-Elmer]] Components and used in a variety of industrial and military devices.  They are best known for their use in igniting [[exploding-bridgewire detonator|exploding-bridgewire]] and [[slapper detonator]]s in [[nuclear weapon]]s, their original application, either directly (sprytrons are usually used for this) or by triggering higher-power [[spark gap]] switches. They are also used to trigger [[thyratron]]s, large [[flashlamp]]s in [[photocopier]]s, [[laser]]s and scientific apparatus, and for firing ignitors for industrial [[explosive]]s.

==Export restrictions in USA==
Because of their potential for use as triggers of nuclear weapons, the export of krytrons is tightly [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations|regulated]] in the United States. A number of cases involving the [[smuggling]] or attempted smuggling of krytrons have been reported, as countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons have attempted to procure supplies of krytrons for igniting their weapons. One prominent case was that of [[1985: The Year of the Spy#Richard Kelly Smyth | Richard Kelly Smyth]], who allegedly helped [[Arnon Milchan]] smuggle 15 orders of 810 krytrons total to Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/nuke/farr.htm|title=Israel's Nuclear Weapons|work=fas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  469 of these were returned to America, with Israel claiming the remaining 441 were &quot;destroyed in testing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas.org&quot;/&gt;  The FBI has released documents showing Netanyahu was allegedly involved in this smuggling ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://original.antiwar.com/smith-grant/2012/07/03/netanyahu-worked-inside-nuclear-smuggling-ring/|title=Netanyahu Worked Inside Nuclear Smuggling Ring  by Grant Smith  -- Antiwar.com|work=antiwar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irmep.org/ila/krytons/06272012_milco_mdr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this story became the main idea behind [[Roman Polanski]]'s film ''[[Frantic (film)|Frantic]]''.

Krytrons and sprytrons handling voltages of 2,500&amp;nbsp;V and above, currents of 100&amp;nbsp;A and above, and switching delays of under 10 microseconds are typically suitable for nuclear weapon triggers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=B4zSFd8DRWYC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=sprytron+vacuum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RHgUQFhYB0&amp;sig=hDvgFD1CLECWYnpyD-x36tABaMc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QcfIS9H2NJb00gS2jrzXDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=45&amp;ved=0CH8Q6AEwLDiWAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sprytron%20vacuum&amp;f=false Technologies underlying weapons of mass destruction] DIANE Publishing ISBN 1-4289-2110-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A krytron was the &quot;[[MacGuffin]]&quot; in Roman Polanski's 1988 film [[Frantic (film)|''Frantic'']].

The krytron, incorrectly called a &quot;kryton&quot;, also appeared in the [[Tom Clancy]] nuclear terrorism novel ''[[The Sum of All Fears]]''.

The plot of [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]]' book ''The Road to Armageddon'' revolved heavily around American-made krytrons that Iranian mullahs wanted for three Russian nuclear artillery shells they had hoped to upgrade to full nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Collins. ''The Road to Armageddon''. New Millennium. 2003. ISBN 1-932407-09-X&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;krytron&quot; appeared in the season 3, episode 14 of the television drama ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]''.

In Season 3 of [[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]] episode &quot;Kill Ari, Part 2&quot;, it was revealed that Ari Haswari, a rogue Mossad operative, had been tasked with acquiring a krytron trigger. Along with stolen plutonium from Dimona, these were key components for an Israeli sting operation. The krytron was also incorrectly called a &quot;kryton&quot;.

==Further developments==
Optically triggered solid-state switches based on [[diamond]] are a potential candidate for krytron replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=oWXDSWd8NPkC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;dq=sprytron&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false CVD Diamond for Electronic Devices and Sensors] by Ricardo S.

The '''Barkhausen–Kurz tube,''' also called the '''retarding-field tube''', '''reflex triode''', '''B–K oscillator''', and '''Barkhausen oscillator'''   was a high frequency [[vacuum tube]] [[electronic oscillator]] invented in 1920 by German physicists [[Heinrich Georg Barkhausen]] and Karl Kurz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thumm&quot;&gt;{{cite web

It was also the first oscillator to exploit electron transit time effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thumm&quot; /&gt;  It was used as a source of high frequency radio waves in research laboratories, and in a few UHF [[radio transmitter]]s through World War 2.  Its output power was low which limited its applications.   However it inspired research that led to other more successful transit time tubes such as the [[klystron]].

==History==
After the development by [[Lee de Forest]] of the [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] in 1906, it was realized that the upper [[frequency]] at which the device could be used was limited by the spacing between internal components. Even with the smallest of spacing, the frequency limit of early triodes was in the low [[megahertz]] range. A technique called velocity modulation was theorized to overcome this limitation.

In 1920, [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] and Karl Kurz at the [[Technische Hochschule]] in [[Dresden]], Germany used the velocity modulation theory in developing the retarded-field triode that could provide UHF operation. Although severely limited in output power, the Barkhausen–Kurz tube was quickly adopted world-wide for UHF research. This device is also called the retarded-field and positive-grid oscillator.  Versions of the Barkhausen oscillator were used in some of the first applications of microwaves, such as the first [[microwave relay]] system, a 1.7 GHz link across the [[English Channel]] in 1931,&lt;ref name=&quot;Free&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The success of the Barkhausen-Kurz tube in generating power at microwave frequencies inspired research to develop similar tubes which did not have its limitations, resulting in the invention of other tubes which were known as &quot;reflex oscillators&quot;.  The best known result of this research was the [[klystron]] tube&lt;ref&gt;Faragő, P. S., and G. Groma, &quot;Reflex oscillators&quot;, ''Acta physica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae'', Vol. 4, No. 1, August, 1954, pp. 7–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, Hans Herbert, ''Applications of Microwaves in Scientific Research'', Elsevier, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; invented 1937 by Russell and Sigurd Varian.  Sources like the klystron and magnetron replaced the B-K tube around World War 2 and it became obsolete.

==How it works==
[[File:English Channel microwave relay antennas 1931.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The first experimental [[microwave relay]] system, a 1.7 GHz link 40 miles across the English channel in 1931, used a Barkhausen-Kurz tube mounted at the focus of the 10 foot dish shown.  It had a radiated power of about 1/2 watt.]]  

The Barkhausen–Kurz tube was a [[triode]] operated with the [[grid (electricity)|grid]] (a thin mesh of wires) at a positive potential relative to both the [[cathode]] (or [[electrical filament|filament]]) and the [[anode]] (or [[plate electrode|plate]]). The negative electrons emitted from the cathode are accelerated toward the positive grid.   Most pass between the grid wires and approach the anode.  The negative anode repels the electrons, reversing their velocity just before reaching the anode surface.  They are then accelerated back toward the grid, again pass through the grid wires, and are then repelled by the negative cathode, their direction reversing just before reaching the surface.  The electrons continue oscillating back and forth through the grid until one by one they strike the grid wires.

The oscillating potential induced on the grid by the motion of the electrons excites oscillations in a [[tank circuit]] attached to the grid, usually consisting of a quarter [[wavelength]] of parallel [[transmission line]] shorted at the end, called a [[resonant stub]].  In turn the oscillating voltage on the tank circuit causes the electrons to ''bunch'' into a cloud of electrons moving back and forth through the grid [[in phase]].  
    
This oscillatory motion of the electron cloud continues, with some electrons lost to grid on each pass constituting the output current.  The lost electrons are replenished by new electrons emitted by the cathode.  The frequency of oscillation depends on the spacing and potentials of the electrodes, and can be changed to a limited extent by altering the electrode voltages.  &lt;ref&gt;Alfvén, Hannes, “On the theory of the barkhausen-kurz oscillations,” ''Philosophical Magazine'' Series 7, Vol. 19, February, 1935, pp. 419–422&lt;/ref&gt;   The space charge density is low and so unlike in a conventional triode oscillator the AC plate and grid current is small, so the output power of the B-K oscillator is low.

[[File:Fleming Valve - US Patent 803,684.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fleming valve schematic from US Patent 803,684.]]

The '''Fleming valve''', also called the '''Fleming oscillation valve''', was a [[vacuum tube]] (or &quot;thermionic valve&quot;) invented in 1904 by [[John Ambrose Fleming]] as a [[detector (radio)|detector]] for early [[radio receiver]]s used in [[electromagnetic waves|electromagnetic]] [[wireless telegraphy]].  It was the first practical [[vacuum tube]] and the first [[thermionic diode]], a vacuum tube whose purpose is to conduct current in one direction and block current flowing in the opposite direction.   The thermionic diode was later widely used as a [[rectifier]] — a device which converts [[alternating current]] (AC) into [[direct current]] (DC) — in the [[power supply|power supplies]] of a wide range of electronic devices, until largely replaced by the [[semiconductor diode]] in the 1960s.  The Fleming valve was the forerunner of all vacuum tubes, which dominated electronics for 50 years.  The [[IEEE]] has described it as &quot;one of the most important developments in the history of electronics&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Fleming_Valve,_1904 |title=Milestones:Fleming Valve, 1904 |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is on the [[List of IEEE Milestones]] for [[electrical engineering]].

==How it works==
The valve consists of an evacuated glass bulb containing two [[electrode]]s: a [[cathode]] in the form of a &quot;[[electrical filament|filament]]&quot;, a loop of carbon or fine tungsten wire, similar to that used in the light bulbs of the time, and an [[anode]] ([[plate electrode|plate]]) consisting of a sheet metal plate.  Although in early versions the anode was a flat metal plate placed next to the cathode, in later versions it became a metal cylinder surrounding the cathode.  In some versions, a grounded copper screen surrounded the bulb to shield against the influence of external electric fields.

In operation, a separate current flows through the cathode &quot;filament&quot;, heating it so that some of the [[electron]]s in the metal gain sufficient energy to escape their parent atoms into the vacuum of the tube, a process called [[thermionic emission]].  The AC current to be rectified is applied between the filament and the plate.  When the plate has a positive voltage with respect to the filament, the electrons are attracted to it and an electric current flows from filament to plate.  In contrast, when the plate has a negative voltage with respect to the filament, the electrons are not attracted to it and no current flows through the tube (unlike the filament, the plate does not emit electrons).  As current can pass through the valve in one direction only, it therefore &quot;[[rectifier|rectifies]]&quot; an AC current to a pulsing DC current.

This simple operation was somewhat complicated by the presence of residual air in the valve, as the vacuum pumps of Fleming's time were unable to create as high a vacuum as exists in modern vacuum tubes.  At high voltages, the valve could become unstable and oscillate, but this occurred at voltages far above those normally used.

==History==
The Fleming valve was the first practical application of [[thermionic emission]], discovered in 1873 by [[Frederick Guthrie]].  As a result of his work on the [[incandescent light bulb]], [[Thomas Edison]] made his own discovery of the phenomenon in 1880, which led to it being called the ''[[Edison effect]]''.  Edison was granted a patent for this device as part of an electrical indicator in 1884, but did not find a practical use for it. Professor Fleming of [[University College London]] consulted for the [[Edison Electric Light Company]] from 1881-1891, and subsequently for the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company]]. 

In 1901 Fleming designed the transmitter used by [[Guglielmo Marconi]] in the first trasmission of radio waves across the Atlantic from [[Poldhu]], [[England]], to [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. The distance between the two points was about {{convert|3,500|km|mi}}. Although the contact, reported November 12, 1901, was widely heralded as a great scientific advance at the time, there is also some skepticism about the claim, because the received signal, the three dots of the [[Morse code]] letter &quot;S&quot;, was so weak the primitive receiver had difficulty distinguishing it from [[sferics|atmospheric radio noise]] caused by static discharges, leading later critics to suggest it may have been random noise.  Regardless, it was clear to Fleming that reliable transatlantic communication with the existing transmitter required more sensitive receiving apparatus.   

[[Image:FRec var.jpg|thumb|[[Thermionic diode]] valves derived from the Fleming valve, from the 1930s ''(left)'' to the 1970s ''(right)'']]

The receiver for the transatlantic demonstration employed a [[coherer]], which had poor sensitivity and degraded the tuning of the receiver. This led Fleming to look for a detector which was more sensitive and reliable while at the same time being better suited for use with tuned circuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/nc4ar/radio.htm Radio Communications: A Brief Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/static/pioneer.htm John Ambrose Fleming (1849-1945) By W A Atherton, Published in Wireless World August 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 Fleming tried an Edison effect bulb for this purpose, and found that it worked well to rectify high frequency oscillations and thus allow detection of the rectified signals by a [[galvanometer]]. On November 16, 1904, he applied for a US patent for what he termed an oscillation valve. This patent was subsequently issued as number 803,684 and found immediate utility in the detection of messages sent by Morse code.

===Oscillation valves===
The Fleming valve proved to be the start of a technological revolution. After reading Fleming's 1905 paper on his oscillation valve, American engineer [[Lee DeForest]] in 1906 created a three-element vacuum tube, the [[Audion tube|Audion]], by adding a wire [[control grid|grid]] between cathode and anode.  It was the first electronic [[amplifier|amplifying]] device, allowing the creation of [[amplifier]]s and continuous wave [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]].   De Forest quickly refined his device into the [[triode]], which became the basis of long-distance [[telephone]] and radio communications, [[radar]]s, and early digital computers for 50 years, until the advent of the transistor in the 1960s.  Fleming sued De Forest for infringing his valve patents, resulting in decades of expensive and disruptive litigation, which were not settled until 1943 when the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled Fleming's patent invalid.&lt;ref&gt;The Supreme Court invalidated the patent because of an improper disclaimer and later maintained the technology in the patent was known art when filed. For more see, [http://www.mercurians.org/1998_Fall/misreading.htm Misreading the Supreme Court: A Puzzling Chapter in the History of Radio]. Mercurians.org. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Power applications===
Later, when [[vacuum tube]] equipment began to be powered from wall power by transformers instead of batteries, the Fleming valve was developed into a [[rectifier]] to produce the DC plate (anode) voltage required by other vacuum tubes.  Around 1914 [[Irving Langmuir]] at [[General Electric]] developed a high voltage version called the [[Kenotron]] which was used to power [[x-ray tube]]s.  As a rectifier, the tube was used for high voltage applications but its high internal resistance made it inefficient in low voltage, high current applications.  Until vacuum tube equipment was replaced by transistors in the 1970s, radios and televisions usually had one or more diode tubes.

[[Image:Vacuum tube multimeter.jpg|thumb|200px| A &quot;Sylvania Electric&quot; multimeter tester for vacuum tubes]]
A '''tube tester''' is an electronic instrument designed to test certain characteristics of [[vacuum tubes]] (thermionic valves). Tube testers evolved along with the vacuum tube to satisfy the demands of the time, and their evolution ended with the tube era. The first tube testers were simple units designed for specific tubes to be used in the battlefields of World War I by radio operators, so they could easily test the tubes of their communication equipment.

==Types of tube testers==
===Modern testers===
The most modern testers perform a multitude of the below tests and are fully automated. Examples of modern testers include the '''Amplitrex AT1000''', the '''Space-Tech Lab EasyTubeTester''', the '''Maxi pre-amp tester''' and the '''maxi-matcher''' (power tubes only) by maxi test and the new, and somewhat more primitive, '''DIVO VT1000''' by Orange Amplification. While the AT1000 , EasyTubeTester and the Maxi-test brand testers offer precise measurements of transconductance/Gm and emissions/iP at full or near full voltages, the Orange tester offers a very simple numerical quality scale. The EasyTubeTester has a very unique feature of quick tube matching +/-percentage display.

===Filament continuity tester===
The simplest tester is the ''filament continuity tester'', usually with a neon lamp connected in series with the filament/heater and a current limiting resistance fed directly by the mains. There is therefore no need to select the appropriate filament voltage for the particular tube under test, but this equipment will not identify tubes that may be faulty in other (more likely) ways, nor indicate any degree of wear.  The same checks can be made with a cheap [[multimeter]]'s resistance test.

===Tube checker===
The tube checker is the second-simplest of all tube testers after filament continuity testing. Tubes are used as a low power [[rectifier]], with all elements other than filament connections connected together as the anode, at a fraction of its normal emission. By mistake referred to sometimes as Emission Tester because they are a crude measure of emission in directly heated types (but a measure of unwanted heater-cathode leakage in indirectly heated types). Switches will need to select the correct filament voltage and pins.

===Emission tester===
Next in complexity is the ''emission tester'', which basically treats any tube as a diode by carefully connecting the cathode to ground, all the grids and plate to [[Battery_(vacuum_tube)#B_battery|B+ voltage]], feeding the filament with the correct voltage, and an ammeter in series with either the plate or the cathode. This effectively measures [[Thermionic emission|emission]], the current which the cathode is capable of emitting, for the given plate voltage, which can usually be controlled by a variable load resistor. Switches will need to select the correct filament voltage plus which pins belong to the filament and cathode(s).

Older testers may call themselves ''Plate Conductance'' if the ammeter is in series with the plate, or ''Cathode Conductance'' if the meter is in series with the cathode.&lt;ref&gt;Know your Tube and Transistor Testers, Robert G. Middleton&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems of ''emission testers'' are:
* they do not measure key characteristics of tubes, like transconductance
* they do not perform the tests at real load, voltages and currents
* they test the tube under static conditions, which are not even near the dynamic conditions the tube would work with in a real electronic device
* tubes with grids might not even show the real emission because of ''hot spots'' in the cathode, hidden by the grids under normal conditions
* grids will be forward biased to some extent - some fine control grid wires are limited in their ability to withstand this
* the amount of current that should be considered &quot;100%&quot; has to be known and documented for each tube type (and will be different for different emission test circuit details)

The ''advantage'' of an emission tester is that from all types of tube testers, it provides the most reliable warning of  tube wear-out. If emission is at 70%, transconductance can be at 90% still, and gain at 100%.  The best and most popular version used by the German army was the Funke W19.

The ''disadvantage'' of an emission tester is that it can test a good tube as bad, and a bad tube as good, because it ignores other properties of the tube. A Tube with Low Emission will work perfectly fine in most circuits, and need not be replaced on that indication alone, unless it measures much lower than specified or if it indicates a short.

===Short circuit test===
Usually, ''emission testers'' and better testers also have a ''short circuit test'' which is just a variation of the continuity tester with a neon lamp, and which allows to identify if there is any shortcut between the different pairs of electrodes.

===Parametrical tester, DC Type===
A tester of this type applies DC voltage to the tube being tested, and datasheet values are verified under real conditions.  Good examples are the Funke W20 and the Neuberger RPG375.

===Parametrical tester, AC Type===
A tester of this type  applies AC voltage to the tube being tested, and datasheet values are verified under conditions which simulate DC operation.  The most popular were the AVO testers.

===Mutual conductance tester===
The mutual conductance tester tests the tube dynamically by applying bias and an AC voltage to the control grid, and measuring the current obtained on the plate, while maintaining the correct DC voltages on the plate and screen grid. This setup measures the [[transconductance]] of the tube, indicated in micromhos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.radiolaguy.com/Mutual-Emission.htm | title = Mutual Conductance vs. Emission Test | accessdate = 2010-12-08 | publisher = RadiolaGuy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic conductance tester===
The dynamic conductance tester is just a variation of the emission tester with its implications, where a proportional AC voltage is applied to each electrode. This tester exists thanks to Jackson{{which|date=September 2013}} mainly to avoid infringing the patents of the ''mutual conductance tester'' held by [[Hickok Electrical Instrument Company]], but  does not provide the same measurements.

===Oscilloscope tube curve tracer plug-in===
A full set of characteristic curves for vacuum tubes, and later [[Semiconductor curve tracer|for semiconductor devices]], could be displayed on an [[oscilloscope]] screen by use of a plug-in adaptor, or on a dedicated curve tracer. An example is the Tektronix 570;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/tektronix_electron_tube_curve_trac.html Radiomuseum: Electron Tube Curve Tracer 570]&lt;/ref&gt; this instrument {{As of|2011|lc=on}} is rare but still sought after, and sells for thousands of US dollars.

==Self-service tube testers==
[[File:RCA-tube-tester-at-Oklahoma-History-Center.jpg|thumb|right|An RCA self-service tube tester on display at the [[Oklahoma History Center]].]]From the late 1920s until the late 1960s, many department stores, drug stores and grocery stores in the U.S. had a self-service tube-vending display.  It typically consisted of a tube-tester atop a locked cabinet of tubes, with a flip chart of instructions.  One would remove the tubes from a malfunctioning device, such as a radio or television, bring them to the store, and test them all, looking up the instructions from the model number on the tube and the flip chart.  If a tube was defective, store personnel would sell a replacement from the cabinet. 

At that time, tubes in consumer devices were socketed and easily replaced by consumers, except for the picture tube (CRT) in televisions. Most devices had a removable back with a diagram showing where to replace each tube. There were only a few types of [[tube socket]], so it was easy to make a mistake. If testing showed all tubes to be working, the next step was a repair shop. As [[transistor]] devices became common, the grocery tube-tester vanished.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12603">[[File:RK5836.JPG|thumb|right|A typical reflex klystron used as a low-power microwave source. Note the terminal on the top of the tube, used to power the keep-alive.]]
A '''Sutton tube''', or '''reflex klystron''', is a type of [[vacuum tube]] used to generate [[microwaves]]. It is a low-power device used primarily for two purposes; one is to provide a tuneable low-power frequency source for the local oscillators in receiver circuits, and the other, with minor modifications, as a switch that could turn on and off another microwave source. The second use, sometimes known as a '''soft Sutton tube''' or '''rhumbatron switch''', was a key component in the development of microwave [[radar]] during [[World War II]]. Microwave switches of all designs, including these, are more generally known as '''T/R tubes''' or '''T/R cells'''.

The Sutton tube is named for one of its inventors, Robert Sutton, an expert in vacuum tube design. The original [[klystron]] designs had been developed in the late 1930s in the US, and Sutton was asked to develop a tuneable version. He developed the first models in late 1940 while working at the [[Admiralty Signals Establishment]]. Sutton tubes were widely used in a variety of forms during [[World War II]] and through the 1960s. Their role has since been taken over by solid state devices like the [[Gunn diode]], which started to become available in the 1970s. &quot;Rhumbatron&quot; refers to the resonant cavity design that was part of many klystrons, referring to the [[rhumba]] because of the dance-like motion of the electrons.

==Basic klystron concept==
{{main|Klystron}}
[[File:Klystron.enp.gif|thumb|right|In a two-cavity klystron, the electrons &quot;bunch up&quot; as they move between the cavities, re-creating the original signal.]]
Klystrons share the basic concept that the microwave output is generated by progressively accelerating then slowing [[electron]]s in an open space surrounded by a resonant cavity. The easiest klystron designs to understand have two cavities.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The first cavity is connected to a source signal, and is designed to resonate at the desired frequency, filling its interior with an oscillating electric field. The cavity's dimensions are a function of the wavelength, most are flat cylinders the shape of a [[hockey puck]] of varying sizes. A hole is drilled through the middle, at the center of the &quot;puck&quot;.{{sfn|Caryotakis|1998|p=3}}

A stream of electrons fired from an [[electron gun]] passes through the hole, and the varying field causes them to either accelerate or decelerate as they pass. Beyond the cavity the accelerated electrons catch up to the decelerated ones, causing the electrons to bunch up in the stream. This causes the stream to re-create the original signal's pattern in the density of the electrons. This area of the tube has to be fairly long to allow time for this process to complete.{{sfn|Caryotakis|1998|pp=1-2}}

The electrons then pass through a second cavity, similar to the first. As they pass, the bunches cause a varying electric field to be induced in the cavity, re-creating the original signal but at much higher current. A tap point on this cavity provides the amplified microwave output.{{sfn|Caryotakis|1998|pp=1-2}}

==Local oscillators==
[[File:Reflex.sch.enp.svg|thumb|right|The reflex klystron essentially folds the two-cavity design in half, using two opposing accelerating fields.]] 
The introduction of the [[cavity magnetron]] caused a revolution in radar design, generating large amounts of power from a compact and easy-to-build device. However, it also required several additional developments before it could be used.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Among these was a suitable [[local oscillator]] about 45&amp;nbsp;MHz different than the transmitter signal, which fed the [[intermediate frequency]] section of the receiver circuits.{{sfn|Watson|2009|p=146}} The problem was that the magnetron's frequency drifted as it warmed and cooled, enough that some sort of tuneable microwave source was needed who's frequency could be adjusted to match. A second magnetron wouldn't work, they would not drift in sync.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpii.com/docs/related/2/Mag%20tech%20art.pdf &quot;Magnetron Theory of Operation&quot;], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the receiver circuit requires only very little output power, the klystron, first introduced only two years earlier, was a natural choice. Sutton, a well known expert in tube design, was asked if he could provide a tuneable version.{{sfn|Lovell|1991|p=61}} An initial model available in 1940 allowed tuning with some effort. While it worked, it was not suitable for an operational system. Sutton and Thompson continued working on the problem, and delivered a solution in October 1940.{{sfn|Watson|2009|p=146}} Thompson named it for Sutton, while Sutton referred to it as the Thompson Tube.&lt;ref&gt;Reg Batt, [http://books.google.ca/books?ei=PqgXU4OyGcWUrgHWloHYCw &quot;The Radar Army: Winning the War of the Airwaves&quot;], Hale, 1991, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The former stuck.

Their advance was to use a single resonator and clever physical arrangement to provide the same effect as two cavities. He did this by placing a second electrode at the far end of the tube, the &quot;reflector&quot; or &quot;repeller&quot;, which caused the electrons to turn around and start flowing back toward the gun. By changing the [[voltage]] of the reflector relative to the gun, the speed of the electrons when they reached the cavity the second time could be adjusted, within limits. The frequency was a function of the velocity of the electrons, providing the tuning function.{{sfn|Lovell|1991|p=61}}

This modification effectively folded the klystron in half, with most of the &quot;action&quot; at the center of the tube where the input and output from the single cavity were located. Furthermore, only the interior of the cavity was inside the tube, the outer surface was in the form of a metal shell wrapped around the tube. Larger changes to the frequency could be made by replacing the outer shell, and this also provided a convenient location for mounting.{{sfn|Lovell|1991|p=61}}

Unfortunately the system needed two high-voltage power supplies, one for the initial acceleration in the gun, and a second between the gun and the reflector. And, due to the way it worked, the system was generally limited to milliwatts of power.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Soft Sutton tube==
One of the advantages of using microwaves for radar is that the size of an antenna is based on the wavelength of the signal, and shorter wavelengths thus require much smaller antennas. This was vitally important for airborne radar systems. German aircraft, using longer wavelengths, required enormous antennas that slowed the aircraft between 25 and 50&amp;nbsp;km/h due to drag.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Denis G.G. Lepage, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=hdQBTcscxyQC&amp;pg=PA61 &quot;Aircraft of the Luftwaffe, 1935-1945&quot;], McFarland, 2009, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Microwaves required antennas only a few centimetres long, and could easily fit within the aircraft nose.

This advantage was offset by the lack of a switching system to allow a single antenna to act as both a transmitter and receiver. This is not always a major problem; the [[Chain Home]] system made do with two sets of antennas, as did early airborne radars like the [[AI Mk. IV radar|Mk. IV]]. In 1940 [[Bernard Lovell]] developed a solution for microwave radar by placing two sets of dipoles in front of a common [[parabolic dish]] and placing a disk of metal foil between them. However, this was not terribly successful, and the [[crystal diode]]s used as detectors frequently burned out as the signal bled through or around the disk.{{sfn|Lovell|1991|p=62}} A solution using two [[spark gap]] tubes was also used, but was less than ideal.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1994|p=192}}

A better solution was suggested by Arthur H. Cooke of the [[Clarendon Laboratory]], and production development was taken up by [[Herbert Wakefield Banks Skinner|H.W.B. Skinner]] along with A.G. Ward and A.T. Starr at the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]].{{sfn|Hodgkin|1994|p=192}} They took a Sutton tube and disconnected the electron gun and reflector, leaving just the cavity. This was filled with a dilute gas, initially [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]],{{sfn|Lovell|1991|p=63}} but eventually settling on a tiny amount of water vapour and argon.{{sfn|Watson|2009|p=165}}

When the transmission signal was seen on the input, the gas would rapidly ionize (helped by a heater coil or radium).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Buderi, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=6UmSE6FKkA4C &quot;The Invention That Changed the World&quot;], Touchstone, 1998, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; The free electrons in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] presented an almost perfect impedance source, blocking the signal from flowing to the output. As soon as the transmission stopped, the gas de-ionized and the impedance disappeared very rapidly.{{sfn|Lovell|1991|p=63}} The tiny echoes caused by reflections from the target, arriving microseconds later, were far too small to cause the ionization, and allowed the signal to reach the output.{{sfn|Watson|2009|p=146}}

The usable soft Sutton tube arrived in March 1941, and was put into production as the CV43.{{sfn|Watson|2009|p=146}} It was first used as part of the [[AI Mk. VIII radar#Mk._VII|AI Mk. VII radar]], the first production microwave radar for aircraft.{{sfn|Lovell|1991|p=63}} The system was widely used from then on, appearing in almost all airborne microwave radars, including the [[H2S radar]].{{sfn|Lovell|1991|p=63}}

Post-war intelligence revealed that the Germans were baffled by the purpose of the soft Sutton tube. Several examples fell into their hands, notably in the ''Rotterdam Gerät'', an H2S that was captured in fairly complete form in February 1943. Interviews with German radar engineers after the war demonstrated that they couldn't understand the purpose of the unpowered tube.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1994|p=192}}

The soft Sutton tube was used in a circuit known as a &quot;T/R switch&quot; (or many variations on that theme). Other spark tubes had been used for this purpose, in a design known as the &quot;Branch- Duplexer&quot;. This consisted of two short lengths of [[waveguide]] about 1/4 of a wavelength, both of which turned on when the signal arrived. Because of the geometry of the layout, the two paths resulted in a reflection of the signal.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Wolff, [http://www.radartutorial.eu/06.antennas/an19.en.html &quot;Branch- Duplexer&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sutton tubes were used in a simpler design known as the &quot;shunt branching circuit&quot;, which was T shaped with the transmitter and antenna located at either end of the horizontal portion of the T, and the receiver at the end of the vertical portion. By locating the Sutton tube at the right location along the waveguide to the receiver, the same effect as the branch-duplexer could be arranged.&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Montgomery, [http://www.jlab.org/ir/MITSeries/V14.PDF &quot;Microwave Duplexers&quot;], MIT&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.L. Samuel, J.W. Clark and W.W.

In the field of [[electronics]], the '''EF50''' is an early all-glass wideband [[Cut-off (electronics)#Remote cutoff|remote cutoff]] [[pentode]] designed in 1938 by [[Philips]]. It was a landmark in the development of [[vacuum tube]] technology, departing from construction ideas of the time essentially unchanged from light bulb designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The EF50, the Tube that helped to Win the War|url=http://www.dos4ever.com/EF50/EF50.html|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially used in television receivers, it quickly gained a vital role in British [[radar]] and great efforts were made to secure a continuing supply of the device as Holland fell in [[World War II]].

The vacuum tube itself is a [[Tube socket#Other Loctals|9-pin Loctal]]-socket device with short internal wires to nine short chromium-iron pins, making it suitable for [[VHF|Very High Frequency]] use.&lt;ref name=&quot;r-type1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Famous EF50 of WW2 by Keith Thrower|url=http://www.r-type.org/articles/art-021.htm|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The EF50 was preceded by [[RCA]]'s [[acorn tube|acorn]] design and several other attempts, such as the “Stahlröhre” from [[Telefunken]], to reduce inductance in the wire leads, all with some disadvantages.  Philips had been working since 1934/5 on an alternative that would solve the problems of the other bases, and a design that could be produced cheaply and in large quantities. A presentation given by M.J.O. Strutt from the tube development group at Philips Research at the first “Internationale Fernseh-Tagung in Zürich” (international television conference in Zürich) described their work in September 1938. A few months later Professor J.L.H. Jonker, who had a leading role in the development of the EF50, published an internal Philips Research Technical Note, Titled: “New radio Tube Constructions”. Jonker's role was confirmed decades later by Th.P.Tromp, head of radio-valve manufacturing and production: &quot;Prof. Dr. Jonker (head of development lab of electronic valves in the mid thirties) was the originator of the EF50 and this development started already as far back as 1934/1935. It was indeed developed in view of possible television application.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=letter of Th.P.Tromp to Mr Bell|url=http://www.dos4ever.com/EF50/letter_Tromp.htm|accessdate=22 May 2014|author=Th.P.Tromp|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television requirements===
[[Pye Ltd.|Pye]], a leading British electronics firm of the time, had pioneered television receiver design, and in the late 1930s wanted to market sets that would allow reception further and further from the single [[Alexandra Palace]] television transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dekker|first=Ronald|title=The EF50, the tube that helped to win the War|url=http://www.dos4ever.com/EF50/EF50.html|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Encouraged by their 1937 success with a novel [[Tuned radio frequency receiver|tuned radio frequency]] (TRF) design, Pye wanted a higher quality valve than they could produce themselves, and so talked to [[Mullard]], which meant the research of Philips in Holland, plus some tweaking from Baden John Edwards and Donald Jackson from Pye (for example the metal shield),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dicker|first=Graham|title=The Secret Radar Valve the EF50 Part 1|url=http://www.philipstorr.id.au/radio/technical/EF50_1.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the EF50 pentode that was needed in the Pye 45 MHz [[Intermediate frequency|IF]] Strip, and created a stable television receiver that captured a good market – being able to receive transmissions at up to 5 times the distance than the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dicker|first=Graham|title=The secret radar valve the EF50 Part 2|url=http://www.philipstorr.id.au/radio/technical/EF50_2.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radar uses===
[[Hugh Dowding]] had already seen the value of [[radar]] for his [[Dowding system|Air Defence system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RADAR – The Battle Winner?|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/history-of-the-battle-of-britain/radar-the-battle-winner.aspx|publisher=The Royal Airforce Museum|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments progressed at [[Bawdsey Manor]] from the mid-1930s; the early ground-based radar chains worked well but needed to be improved in accuracy, and Dowding saw the need for an airborne radar. At Bawdsey, [[Edward George Bowen|Taffey Bowen]] had also needed a wideband [[vacuum tube|valve]] for [[Airborne Interception radar|Airborne Interception]] (AI) radar; he had just one working set. So he contacted Tom Goldup, a senior director of [[Mullard]],&lt;ref name=&quot;r-type1&quot;/&gt; and &quot;quite by chance in April or May of 1939&quot; he heard of the Pye set from his old Professor at King's College, [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]]. Visiting Pye, Bowen saw scores of what he was after, their 45MHz TRF chassis using the very new EF50, which he later described as &quot;a valve that was to play almost as important a part in the radar war as the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]] itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=Edward G|title=Radar Days|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0586-0|page=77|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight from Holland===
Because the EF50 had to come from Holland, yet was vital for the RDF ([[radar]]), great efforts were made to secure a continuing supply as the risk of Holland being overrun increased. Mullard in England did not have the ability to manufacture the special glass base, for example, and just before Germany invaded Holland, a truckload with 25,000 complete EF50s and many more of their special bases were successfully sent to England.&lt;ref name=&quot;r-type1&quot;/&gt; The entire EF50 production line was hurriedly relocated to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EF50|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_ef50.html|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 May, the day before the Germans flattened Rotterdam in 1940, members of the Philips family escaped together with the Dutch government on the British [[destroyer]] [[HMS Windsor (D42)|HMS ''Windsor'']], taking with them a small wooden box containing the industrial diamond [[die (manufacturing)#Wire pulling|die]]s needed to make the fine tungsten wires in the valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dekker|first=Ronald|title=The EF50, the Tube that helped to Win the War|url=http://www.dos4ever.com/EF50/EF50_klein.html|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet great wartime demand the EF50 was also made by [[Marconi-Osram Valve|Marconi-Osram]] (with the name Z90) and [[A.C. Cossor|Cossor]] (their version named 63SPT) in the United Kingdom as well as Mullard (who were effectively using the Philips production line after it was moved from Holland). Versions were also made in Canada by [[Rogers Vacuum Tube Company|Rogers]] and in the USA by [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]].

British military (Ministry of Aircraft Production Specification) and US JAN type numbers assigned to the EF50 include:

'''Grid bias''' is a [[direct current|DC]] voltage applied to [[Vacuum tube|electron tubes]] (or valves in British English) with three electrodes or more, such as triodes. The control grid (usually the first grid) of these devices is used to control the electron flow from the heated [[cathode]] to the positively charged [[anode]]. Bias point in small-signal applications is set to minimize [[distortion]] and achieve sufficiently low power draw. In high-power applications, biasing is typically set for maximum available output power or voltage, with a secondary target of ''either'' low distortion ''or'' high efficiency.

* In a typical [[voltage amplifier]], including power stages of most [[audio power amplifier]]s, DC bias voltage is negative relative to cathode potential. Instant grid voltage (sum of DC bias and [[alternating current|AC]] input signal) should never rise above cathode potential to prevent grid-to-cathode currents that overload preceding amplifier stages and may cause severe even-order distortion. High transconductance tubes develop significant grid currents even with small negative bias; in these cases, maximum instant voltage ceiling is lowered to -1.0..-0.5 [[Volt]].
* High efficiency [[Class_B_amplifier#Class_B_and_AB|Class B+]] [[push-pull amplifier]]s operate at higher bias points (near zero or even positive values). These designs take care of grid currents through the use of [[cathode follower]]s or [[interstage transformer]]s easing current load on the driver stages, and deep [[negative feedback]] to minimize distortion. 
* High power [[transmitter tube]]s ([[oscillator]]s and [[modulator]]s) are frequently positively biased to maximize radio frequency output. Distortion is minimized by using [[band-pass filter]] loads tuned to the desired radio frequency.

Bias voltage is obtained through:
* An external voltage source (fixed bias) - a battery or a dedicated DC power supply. When the cathode potential is raised above ground (as in [[cascode]] circuits), bias voltage is obtained by tapping into main (positive) plate power supply. 
* Automatic bias  or ''self bias'' - using a cathode [[resistor]] to raise cathode potential above grid (tied to ground) and stabilize plate current; 
* Grid leak bias - diverting DC grid current through a high value grid resistor.

An '''acorn tube''', or '''acorn valve''', refers to any member of a number of [[vacuum tube]]s produced in the [[USA]] starting just before [[World War II]]. They were named after their resemblance to the [[acorn]], specifically due to the glass cap at one end of the tube that looked similar to the cap on an acorn. The acorn tubes were designed to work at high frequencies, and found widespread use in [[radio]]s and [[radar]] systems. The introduction of the [[EF50]] was the first serious competition for the acorn design, and replaced the acorns in many roles, especially post-war when millions of surplus EF50s were dumped on the market.

The range included about a dozen valves, designed to work in the [[VHF]] range. The 955 is a [[triode]]. The 954 and 956 types are sharp and remote cut-off [[pentode]]s, respectively, all with indirect 6.3&amp;nbsp;V, 150&amp;nbsp;mA heaters. Types 957, 958 and 959 are for portable equipment and have 1.25&amp;nbsp;V [[Nickel–cadmium battery|NiCd battery]] heaters. The 957 is a medium-mu signal triode, the 958 is a transmitting triode with dual, paralleled filaments for increased emission, and the 959 is a sharp cut-off pentode like the 954. The 957 and 959 draw 50&amp;nbsp;mA heater current, the 958 twice as much. In 1942, the 958A with tightened emission specs was introduced after it turned out that 958s with excessively high emission kept working after the filament power was turned off, the filament still sufficiently heating on the anode current alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/084/9/957.pdf |title= 957&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;958&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;959 (Acorn Types) |publisher=[[RCA|R.C.A.

{{mergefrom|Beam tetrode|date=January 2015}}

A '''tetrode''' is a [[vacuum tube]] having four active [[electrode]]s. There are several varieties of tetrode with '''screen-grid tube''', and the [[beam tetrode]] being the most common. The four electrodes in order from the centre are: a [[thermionic cathode]], first and second grids and a [[plate electrode|plate]]. In screen-grid tubes and beam tetrodes, the first grid is the [[control grid]] and the second grid is the '''screen grid'''.&lt;ref&gt;L.W. Turner, (ed), ''Electronics Engineer's Reference Book'', 4th ed. Newnes-Butterworth, London 1976 ISBN 0408001682 page 7-19&lt;/ref&gt; In other tetrodes one of the grids is a control grid, while the other may have a variety of functions.

During the period 1913 to 1927, three distinct types of tetrode valves appeared.  All had a normal control grid whose function was to act as a primary control for current passing through the tube, but they differed according to the intended function of the other grid. In order of historical appearance these are: the '''space-charge grid tube''', the '''bi-grid valve''', and the '''screen-grid tube'''. The last of these appeared in two distinct variants with different areas of application: the screen-grid valve proper, which was used for medium-frequency, small signal amplification, and the beam tetrode which appeared later, and was used for audio or radio-frequency power amplification.  The former was quickly superseded by the rf [[pentode]], while the latter was initially developed as an alternative to the pentode as an audio power amplifying device.  The beam tetrode was also developed as a high power radio transmitting tube, and has remained in use until quite recently in both applications.

==How it works==
[[Image:4-1000A linear RF deck build by K5LAD.jpg|thumb|4-1000A 1 KW power tetrode in an amateur radio transmitter]]
The tetrode functions in a similar way to the [[triode]], from which it was developed.  A current through the heater or filament heats the [[cathode]], which causes it to emit electrons by [[thermionic emission]].  A positive voltage is applied between the plate and cathode, causing a flow of electrons from the cathode to plate through the two grids.  A varying voltage applied to the [[control grid]] can control this current, causing variations in the plate current.  With a resistive or other load in the plate circuit, the varying current will result in a varying voltage at the plate.  With proper [[Biasing (electronics)|biasing]], this voltage will be an amplified (but inverted) version of the AC voltage applied to the control grid, thus the tetrode can provide voltage [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]. In the tetrode, the function of the other grid varies according to the type of tetrode; this is discussed below.

==Space charge grid tube==
The space charge grid tube was the first type of tetrode to appear.  In the course of his research into the action of the &quot;[[audion]]&quot; triode tube of [[Lee de Forest]], [[Irving Langmuir]] found that the action of the heated [[thermionic cathode]] was to create a [[space charge]], or cloud of electrons, around the [[cathode]].  This cloud acted as a virtual cathode.  With low applied anode voltage, many of the electrons in the [[space charge]] returned to the cathode, and did not contribute to the anode current; only those at its outer limit would be affected by the [[electric field]] due to the anode, and would be accelerated towards it.  However, if a grid bearing a low positive applied potential (about 10V) were inserted between the cathode and the control grid, the space charge could be made to extend further away from the cathode.  This had two advantageous effects, both related to the influence of the electric fields of the other electrodes (anode and control grid) on the electrons of the space charge.  Firstly, a significant increase in anode current could be achieved with low anode voltage; the valve could be made to work well with lower applied anode voltage.  Secondly the [[transconductance]] (rate of change of anode current with respect to control grid voltage) of the tube was increased. The latter effect was particularly importance since it increased the voltage gain available from the valve.

Space-charge valves remained useful devices throughout the valve era, and were used in applications such as car radios operating directly from a 12V supply, where only a low anode voltage was available.   The same principle was applied to other types of multi-grid tubes such as [[pentode]]s.  As an example, the Sylvania 12K5 is described as &quot;a tetrode designed for space-charge operation.  It is intended for service as a power amplifier driver where the potentials are obtained directly from a 12V automobile battery.&quot;   The space-charge grid was operated at +12V,  the same as the anode supply voltage.

Another important application of the space-charge tetrode was as an [[electrometer]] tube for detecting and measuring extremely small currents.  For example, the General Electric FP54 was described as a &quot;space-charge grid tube ... designed to have a very high input impedance and a very low grid current.  It is designed particularly for amplification of direct currents smaller than about 10^-9 amperes, and has been found capable of measuring currents as small as 5 x 10^-18 amperes&quot;.  It has a current amplification factor of 250,000, and operates with an anode voltage of 12v, and space-charge grid voltage of +4V.

Note that when a space-charge grid is added to a [[triode]], the first grid in the resulting tetrode is the space-charge grid, and the second grid is the [[control grid]].

==Bi-grid valve==
In the bi-grid type of tetrode, both grids are intended to carry electrical signals, so both are control grids.  The first example to appear in Britain was the Marconi-Osram FE1, which was designed by H.J. Round, and became available in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thrower&quot;/&gt; The tube was intended to be used in a reflex circuit (for example the single-valve ship receiver Type 91&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott-Taggart&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Bigrid transmitter.jpg|thumb|right|Bi-grid Tetrode application as self-oscillating AM transmitter]]
One application is shown in the illustration.  This is recognisable as an AM telephony transmitter in which the second grid and the anode form a power [[oscillator]], and the first grid acts as a modulating electrode. The anode current in the valve, and hence the RF output amplitude, is modulated by the voltage on G1, which is derived from a carbon microphone.

A tube of this type could also be used as a direct conversion CW receiver. Here the valve oscillates as a consequence of coupling between the first grid and the anode, while the second grid is coupled to the antenna.  The AF beat frequency is audible in the headphones.  The valve acts as a self-oscillating [[product detector]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Scott-Taggart 1919&quot;&gt;{{cite book

One control grid carried the incoming rf signal, while the other was connected into an [[oscillator]] circuit which generated the local oscillation within the same valve.  Since the anode current of the bi-grid valve was proportional both to the signal on the first grid, and also to the oscillator voltage on the second grid, the required multiplication of the two signals was achieved, and the intermediate frequency signal appeared in an appropriately [[tuned circuit]] connected to the anode.  In all of the applications mentioned, the bi-grid tetrode acted as an analogue multiplier ([[analog multiplier]]) which multiplied together the signals applied to the two grids.

The super-sonic [[heterodyne]] ([[superhet]]) receiver principle was invented in France by Lucien Levy in 1917&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Thrower&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (p 66), though credit is usually also given to [[Edwin Armstrong]]. The original reason for the invention of the superhet was that before the appearance of the screen-grid valve, there was no type of valve which could give good gain at radio frequencies (i.e. frequencies much above 100&amp;nbsp;kHz), so a technique was applied whereby the incoming rf signal was &quot;mixed&quot; (i.e. multiplied) with a locally generated oscillatory voltage (the [[local oscillator]]) so as to produce a [[beat frequency]] at the significantly lower frequency of about 30&amp;nbsp;kHz.  This represented the incoming signal in all important respects, but at a lower frequency, at which it could be successfully amplified by a [[multistage]] tuned triode amplifier before being applied to the detector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Admiralty&quot;&gt;{{cite book

It went out of use when screen-grid valves appeared which could act as satisfactory rf amplifiers capable of amplifying the incoming signal without lowering its frequency (see Screen grid valve, below). [[Superhet]] receivers reappeared in the early 1930s when, because of the proliferation of transmitting stations, their greater selectivity became an important advantage; almost all receivers operate on this principle today, albeit with a higher if frequency.

==Screen grid valve==
[[File:S23 screen grid valves in music magnet.jpg|thumb|right|Two S23 Screen-Grid Valves in situ in a 1929 Osram Music Magnet Receiver]]
[[File:S23 sg valve.JPG|thumb|right|View of the interior of an Osram S23 Screen Grid Valve.  In this valve the anode is in the form of two flat plates. The wires of the screen grid can also be seen. The anode connection is at the top of the envelope to minimise anode-grid capacitance]]
[[Image:S625 screen grid tube.png|thumb|The Marconi-Osram S625, the first commercially produced screen grid tube which came out 1926.  The screen is a cylinder with a metal gauze face that completely surrounds the plate, and the tube is double-ended, with the plate terminal at one end and the grid at the other, to improve isolation between the electrodes.]]
In the screen grid class of tetrode, the main function of the second grid is to act as an [[electrostatic screen]] between the anode and the control grid (i.e. the first grid) in order to reduce the internal [[capacitance]] between control grid and anode.  The first true screen-grid valve, with a screen grid designed for this purpose, was patented by Hiroshi Ando in 1919, and the first practical versions were built by N. H. Williams and [[Albert Hull]] at [[General Electric]]  and [[Bernard Tellegen]] at Phillips in 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;{{cite book

This type of tetrode was developed to correct deficiencies in the [[triode]] tube which became apparent when attempts were made to use triodes as small-signal radio-frequency [[amplifiers]].  In the triode, the control grid was next to the plate.  Capacitance between these two electrodes caused instability and oscillation when both anode and grid were connected into tuned resonant circuits, as was the case in early radios, or in any application where the anode circuit presented an inductive reactive load to the valve.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner&quot;&gt;{{cite book

A second advantage of the tetrode, which also arose from reduced anode-grid capacitance, was that, when the anode voltage was in a certain range, changing its value had much less effect on the anode current than was the case with triodes. This corresponds to an increased anode slope resistance, and allowed much higher voltage gain by permitting a larger external load resistance.  At the time of the introduction of screen-grid valves (around 1927) a typical small triode used for small-signal amplification had an anode slope resistance of 20kOhms or less, and a grid-anode capacitance of 1 to 5[[farad|pF]], while the corresponding figures for a typical screen grid valve were 1MOhm and 0.004[[farad|pF]] - in some cases much less capacitance.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1976, page 7-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Screen-grid valves were capable of greater [[voltage gain]] and higher [[frequency]] capability than triodes, and permitted the development of the first true RF amplifiers in the MF and HF frequency ranges in radio equipment.  They were commonly used as the first stage of radio-frequency amplification in domestic radio receivers in the period 1927 to 1930, after which they were superseded in this application by RF pentodes. Triodes were ill-suited to this type of application on account of their relatively high anode-grid capacitance and low anode resistance.

In normal operation the screen grid is connected to a positive DC voltage slightly less than the plate voltage, and bypassed to the cathode with a [[capacitor]], so it was at AC ground.  To take full advantage of the very low internal grid-anode capacitance, the valve must be used in circuits in which the shielding between anode and grid is continued externally.  In the case illustrated (S625), the valve was intended to be inserted into a hole in an external, grounded, sheet-metal shield aligned to correspond with the position of the internal screen-grid.  The input, or control-grid circuit was on one side of the shield, while the anode, or output circuit was on the other.  In the case of the Osram Music Magnet, each entire stage of the 2-stage rf amplifier, as well as the tuned detector stage, was enclosed in an individual large aluminium screening box.  These boxes have been removed in the illustration, but the up-turned edges of the bases of the boxes can be seen.

==Anode characteristic of screen-grid valves==
The reason for the limited applicability of the screen-grid valve, and its rapid replacement by the RF [[pentode]] (introduced around 1930) was the peculiar anode characteristic (i.e. variation of anode current with respect to anode voltage) of the former type of tube.
[[File:RCA 24-A Screen Grid tube anode characteristics.jpg|thumb|right|At certain values of plate voltage and current, the tetrode characteristic curves are kinked due to [[secondary emission]] from the anode.  In the normal range of anode voltages, the anode current is substantially constant with respect to anode voltage.  Both features are quite unlike the corresponding curves for a triode, for which anode current increases continuously with increasing slope throughout.]]
In normal applications, the anode voltage was about 150V, while that of the screen-grid was about 60V (Thrower p 183).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thrower&quot; /&gt;  As the screen grid is positive with respect to the cathode, it collects a certain fraction (perhaps a quarter) of the electrons which would otherwise pass from the grid region to the anode.  This causes current to flow in the screen grid circuit.  Usually, the screen current due to this cause is small, and of little interest.  However, if the anode voltage should be below that of the screen, the screen grid can also collect [[secondary emission|secondary electrons]] ejected from the anode by the impact of the energetic primary electrons.  Both effects tend to reduce the anode current. If the anode voltage is increased from a low value, with the screen grid at its normal operating voltage (60V, say) the anode current initially increases rapidly because more of those electrons which pass through the screen-grid are collected by the anode rather than passing back to the screen grid.  This part of the tetrode anode characteristic resembles the corresponding part of that of a [[triode]] or [[pentode]].  However, when the anode voltage is increased further, the electrons arriving at the anode have sufficient energy to cause copious secondary emission, and many of these secondary electrons will be captured by the screen, which is at a higher positive voltage than the anode. This causes the anode current to fall rather than increase when the anode voltage is increased.  In some cases the anode current can actually become negative (current flows out of the anode); this is possible since each primary electron may produce more than one secondary. Falling positive anode current accompanied by rising anode voltage gives the anode characteristic a region of negative slope, and this corresponds to a [[negative resistance]] which can cause instability in certain circuits.  In a higher range of anode voltage, the anode voltage sufficiently exceeds that of the screen for an increasing proportion of the secondary electrons to be attracted back to the anode, so the anode current increases once more, and the slope of the anode characteristic becomes positive again.  In a yet higher range of anode voltages, the anode current becomes substantially constant, since all of the secondary electrons now return to the anode, and the main control of current through the tube is the voltage of the control grid. This is the normal operating mode of the tube.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terman&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[File:6L6 triode anode characteristics.jpg|thumb|right|Typical triode anode characteristics]]
The anode characteristic of a screen-grid valve is thus quite unlike that of a [[triode]].  It includes a range of anode voltages, where the anode voltage is less than that of the screen grid, in which there is a distinctive [[negative resistance]] characteristic, sometimes called &quot;tetrode kink&quot;.  This is usually undesirable, although it can be exploited as in the [[dynatron oscillator]] (Eastman, p 431).&lt;ref name=&quot;Eastman&quot; /&gt; The approximately constant-current region of low slope at high anode voltage is also a distinctive characteristic of the tetrode.  This is highly desirable, since it corresponds to a high [[source resistance]] in the anode circuit, and greatly enhances the voltage gain which the device can produce. Early screen-grid valves had amplification factors (i.e. the product of [[transconductance]] and anode slope resistance) ten times that of comparable small-signal triodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;RCA&quot;&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The high anode resistance (i.e. low slope) in the normal operating range is a consequence of the electrostatic shielding action of the screen grid, since it prevents the electric field due to the anode from penetrating to the control grid region, where it might otherwise influence the passage of electrons, increasing the electron current when the anode voltage is high, reducing it when low.
[[File:6J7 pentode anode characteristics.jpg|thumb|right|Typical pentode anode characteristic.  There is a wide range of anode voltages in which the characteristic has a small positive slope. In a screen-grid tube this region is restricted to a much narrower range at high anode voltages.]]
In practice the negative-resistance kink of the anode characteristic limits the usefulness of the screen-grid valve to applications where only small signals are amplified, so that the variations in anode voltage are also correspondingly small, and the operating conditions never depart from the region of high positive impedance (low positive slope) at large anode voltage. The [[secondary emission]] can be prevented from contributing to the screen current (and thus detracting from the anode current) by adding a [[suppressor grid]], making a  [[pentode]], or [[beam tetrode|beam plates]] to make a [[beam tetrode]]/kinkless tetrode, which can be used in power amplifiers where the variations of anode voltage, due to the presence of a large signal voltage, are much greater. The anode characteristics of these tubes are very similar to [[pentode]]s.  In both cases the anode current rises rapidly to an approximately constant value when the anode voltage rises to as little as a few tens of volts, and the region of high positive anode resistance (low slope) extends from this low value up to the maximum anode voltage which could be several hundred volts or more.

The negative resistance operating region of the tetrode is exploited in the [[dynatron oscillator]], which is an example of a negative resistance oscillator.  (Eastman, p431)&lt;ref name=&quot;Eastman&quot; /&gt;

The high value of the anode slope resistance of tetrodes (mentioned above) makes them capable of high voltage and power gain, and is also potentially a cause of high anode efficiency which, if it could be exploited, would make tetrodes superior to [[triode]]s as power amplifying devices in applications such as audio power amplifiers, and the output stages of radio transmitters. For a triode power amplifier working with a transformer or inductive load in Class A, the maximum theoretical efficiency is 25%.  This low figure is in part a consequence of the low anode slope impedance (Ra) of this type of tube; the low value of a triode Ra is almost always much less than the optimal anode load impedance in a power amplifier.  For a pentode or tetrode, however, Ra is usually sufficiently high for the optimal load impedance to be achieved, and under these circumstances the maximum theoretical efficiency rises to 50%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gavin &amp; Houldin&quot;&gt;{{cite book

However, the tetrode kink limits the permissible variation of anode voltage, and restricts the use of screen-grid valves to small-signal applications.  The [[suppressor grid]] of the [[pentode]] eliminates the kink in the anode characteristic by preventing secondary electrons, which originate in the anode, from reaching the screen grid, and thus permits a wider excursion of anode voltage, as is required for power amplification.  The same effect can be produced in the case of a tetrode by introducing two modifications. Firstly, the wires of the screen grid are aligned with those of the control grid so that the former lie in the electron 'shadow' created by the latter. This reduces the screen grid current, thereby giving greater efficiency, and also concentrates the electrons into dense beams in the space between the screen grid and the anode.  The intense negative [[space charge]] of these beams prevents [[secondary electrons]] from the anode from reaching the screen grid, thus eliminated the tetrode kink. Secondly, in small valves whose electrode structure is supported in the conventional way with vertical wire rods and mica spacers, it was found to be necessary to introduce sheet-metal beam-forming electrodes between the screen grid and the anode.  The purpose of these beam-plates is to constrain the electron beams into parts of the electrode system which are sections of a cylinder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shade&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Successful creation of the electron beam between screen grid and anode required for a kinkless anode characteristic depends on the details of the geometry of the electrode structure of the beam tetrode. In the cases where the electrodes have complete cylindrical symmetry, a kinkless characteristic can be achieved without the need for beam-plates, alignment of the screen grid wires with those of the control grid being sufficient. This form of construction is usually adopted in the larger tubes with an anode power rating of 100W or more.  The Eimac 4CX250B (rated at 250W anode dissipation) is an example of this class of beam tetrode. Note that a radically different approach is taken to the design of the support system for the electrodes in these types (see illustration).  The 4CX250B is described by its manufacturer as a 'radial beam tetrode', drawing attention to the symmetry of its electrode system.

The overall effect of the original developments was to produce a highly effective power amplifier tube, whose anode characteristic is very much like that of a [[pentode]], but which has greater efficiency as a result of reduced screen current.  A further bonus was that third [[harmonic distortion]] was much reduced relative to a comparable [[pentode]] (Terman pp 198–9). &lt;ref name=&quot;Terman&quot; /&gt; [[Beam tetrode]] audio power output valves were introduced in 1937, and quickly replaced conventional pentodes in this application.  Later developments produced beam power tubes which were capable of high-power output at frequencies extending into the UHF region.

The beam tetrode was invented in Britain by two EMI engineers, Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda, as an attempt to circumvent the power pentode, whose patent was owned by Philips.  It was patented in 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bull &amp; Rodda&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Although the beam-plates (when present) could be counted as a fifth electrode (as in a pentode), this type of tube is nevertheless classified as a tetrode, perhaps to underline the difference in principle from that employed in true pentodes, which rely upon the effect of a suppressor grid. Beam tetrodes were widely used as audio power amplifying tubes in consumer and industrial electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s when they were replaced by [[transistor]]s.  Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters.  Low power consumer beam tetrodes are still used in a few legacy and specialty vacuum tube audio power amplifier devices such as tube [[guitar amplifier]]s; the [[KT66]] and [[KT88]] are popular examples in audio equipment, while QY4-400 is an example having 400W anode dissipation, capable of applications in radio transmitters up to 100&amp;nbsp;MHz.  The 4CX250B, mentioned above can be operated at full 250W anode dissipation up to 500&amp;nbsp;MHz.  Many other types abound.

==Critical-distance tetrode==
An alternative approach to the problem of eliminating the tetrode kink was introduced by Hivac in 1935.  It was found by J.H Owen Harries that if the separation of the anode from the screen grid were varied, a critical separation could be found (about 3&amp;nbsp;cm) where the kink in the tetrode's anode characteristic disappeared, and the amplification of the valve became particularly distortion-free.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harries&quot;&gt;{{cite book

A range of tetrodes of this type were introduced, aimed at the domestic receiver market, some having 2V directly heated filaments, intended for low-power battery-operated sets, others with 4V or higher, indirectly heated cathodes for mains operation.  Output powers ranged from 0.5W to 11.5W .  Confusingly, several of these new valves bore the same type number as existing pentodes with almost identical characteristics. Examples include Y220 (0.5W, 2V filament), AC/Y (3W, 4V heater), AC/Q (11.5W, 4V heater), etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harries&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a cavity has a large number of resonances but in the resonant mode used, large RF fields are developed in the gaps between the rungs. The [[phase (waves)|phase]] advance from gap to gap is selected in such a way that an electron sees the same field at every gap, and it is described as being [[synchronous]]. In this context, the same field means a field of the same phase but not necessarily the same [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]].

An electron beam which enters an RF excited cavity with approximately synchronous velocity will receive cumulative velocity modulation at each gap. After some distance into the resonator, repeatedly [[Acceleration|accelerated]] [[electron]]s will be catching up with electrons repeatedly decelerated, and bunches will form. These bunches will have a velocity close to the beam velocity. If the electron velocity is somewhat greater than synchronous, the bunches will start to cross gaps when the field is retarding, rather than zero. When this happens, the electrons are slowed; their lost [[energy]] is gained by the cavity and sustained oscillations become possible. As the velocity of the beam entering the cavity is increased further, more energy is transferred to the cavity and the [[frequency]] of [[oscillation]] rises somewhat. Eventually, however, the bunches punch through the retarding fields and oscillations cease abruptly. Reducing the beam velocity (voltage) will cause the tube to resume oscillation. However, it is necessary to reduce the beam velocity below the value at which oscillations ceased before oscillation will start again. This phenomenon is known as [[hysteresis]] and is similar to that observed in many [[Klystron#Reflex klystron|reflex klystrons]].

The frequency change which occurs as the beam voltage is raised is referred to as electronic tuning, and is typically 0.2% of the operating frequency measured from half power to cessation of oscillation. For larger frequency changes mechanical tuning is used which is obtained by moving one wall of the cavity. The moveable wall is, in fact, a piston which can be moved in a tunnel whose cross-section is that of the wall which it replaces. The range of mechanical tuning is usually limited by parasitic resonances which occur when the oscillating frequency and the frequency of one of the many other cavity resonances coincide. When this happens, serious loss is introduced, often sufficient enough to suppress oscillation completely. Typically, a mechanical tuning range of 4% can be obtained&lt;ref&gt;Roitman et al, High Power CW 264 GHz tunable Extended Interaction Oscillator, 14th International Vacuum Electronics Conference (IVEC), Paris, France 2013&lt;/ref&gt; but greater ranges have been demonstrated.

Apart from the resonant cavity, the Extended Interaction Oscillator is very similar to more conventional [[klystron]]s. An electron gun produces a narrow beam of electrons which is maintained at the required [[diameter]] by a [[magnetic field]] while it passes through the RF section. Thereafter, the beam enters a relatively field-free region where it spreads out and is collected by an appropriately cooled collector. Many of these oscillators have electrically isolated [[anode]]s and in these cases, the [[voltage]] between the [[cathode]] and anode determines the tube current which in turn determines the maximum power output.

'''6L6''' is the designator for a [[vacuum tube]] introduced by [[Radio Corporation of America]] in July 1936. At the time [[Philips]] had already developed and patented power [[pentode]] designs, which were fast replacing power [[triode]]s due to their greater efficiency. The [[beam tetrode]] design of the 6L6 allowed RCA to circumvent Philips' pentode patent.

== History ==
The 6L6 is a descendant of the &quot;Harries Valve&quot; developed by British engineer [[J. Owen Harries]] and marketed by the [[Hivac Co. Ltd.]] in 1935. Harries is believed{{By whom?|date=November 2013}} to have been the first engineer to discover the &quot;critical distance&quot; effect, which maximized the efficiency of a power [[tetrode]], by positioning its [[anode]] at a distance which is a specific multiple of the [[screen grid]]-[[cathode]] distance. This design also minimized interference of [[secondary emission]] electrons dislodged from the anode.

EMI engineers [[Cabot Bull]] and [[Sidney Rodda]] improved the Harries design with a pair of beam plates, connected to the cathode, which directed the electron streams into two narrow areas and also acted like a [[suppressor grid]] to redirect some secondary electrons back to the anode. The beam tetrode design was also undertaken to avoid the patents which the giant [[Philips]] firm held on power [[pentode]]s in Europe. Because this overall design eliminated the &quot;tetrode kink&quot; (negative resistance) in the lower parts of the tetrode's voltage-current characteristic curves, which sometimes caused tetrode [[amplifier]]s to become unstable, MOV ([[Marconi-Osram Valve]], a subsidiary of [[EMI]] jointly owned with [[General Electric Company plc]]) marketed this tube family under the sobriquet &quot;KT&quot;, meaning &quot;kinkless tetrode&quot;.

Because MOV's engineers did not feel the kinkless tetrode could be successfully mass-produced, they licensed the design to RCA. This proved to be a poor business decision on MOV's part. RCA subsequently had enormous success with the 6L6. It replaced the use of power triodes in public-address amplifiers almost overnight. So many applications were found for the 6L6 that a complete list would be impossible to assemble. MOV introduced their version, the [[KT66]], a year later.

[[File:Sovtek 5881 vacuum tube.jpg|200px|left]]
RCA's first version was an early [[Tube socket|octal base]] tube. Like most with this base it had a metal, rather than glass, envelope. Later versions, including the 6L6G, 6L6GA, 6L6GB, 5881, 5932, 7027, and the final version 6L6GC had glass envelopes, which made [[thermal radiation|radiation]] cooling of the anode easier. The voltage and power rating of the 6L6 series were gradually pushed upwards by adding features such as a [http://www.antiquewireless.org/otb/vt0108.htm Micanol] base, thicker plates, thicker grid wires, grid cooling fins, and special ultra-black plate coatings.  The original metal version was rated for 19 watts dissipation while the later 6L6GC is usually rated for 30 watts. A &quot;W&quot; in the descriptor, as in 6L6WGB, identifies the tube as designed for mechanically rugged environments, such as military or airborne use.

== Variations ==
Early variations included transmitting tubes such as the [[807 (vacuum tube)|807]] (1937) with 6.3V heater, plate (anode) connected to a top cap, and equivalent 12.6V 1625, the smaller [[6V6]] (1936), the many KT versions marketed in Europe, and a subsequent vast array of audio and RF power tubes. One of the largest-volume post-WWII applications was in the basic design of television sweep power tubes, starting with the 6BG6G (1946), a modified [[807 (vacuum tube)|807]]. TV designs rarely used [[transistor]]s in place of sweep tubes—a challenging high-power and high-speed application—until the 1970s.

The 807 was preferred to the similar 6L6 by [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts because high transient voltages on the 6L6's anode when operating in class C could cause a [[electric arc|flashover]] between pins 2 and 3 on the octal base, whereas this was not a problem with the top-cap anode of the otherwise identical 807, physically distant from all the base pins.

In guitar amplifiers, this flashover problem sometimes occurs if the amplifier is operated without the speakers connected, causing the [[self inductance]] of the output [[transformer]] primary winding to generate high voltages when the current changes due to the applied signal. For this reason the speaker terminals of 6L6 tube amplifiers are sometimes short-circuited by a switching 6.3&amp;nbsp;mm jack when the speakers are disconnected.

Further testimony for this device's success would be even simpler: {{As of|2012|lc=on}} the 6L6GC version was still being manufactured and used, primarily in [[guitar amplifier]]s. Manufacture continued in [[Russia]] (two factories), [[China]] (two factories), and [[Slovakia]].    (In 2006, Ei Electronics in [[Serbia]] discontinued making tubes.) The 6L6 had one of the longest active lifetimes of any electronic component, more than 70 years.

When a [[vacuum tube]] circuit malfunctions and draws excessive current, the [[Plate electrode|anode]] (&quot;plate&quot;) may overheat, sometimes causing a visible [[red]] or orange glow. In [[consumer electronics]], this is universally indicative that the tube is experiencing an [[Overcurrent|overload]] condition, though the reasons for the overload may vary.

Some high-powered vacuum tubes (e.g. large transmitter or [[induction heating]] tubes) have [[Fused quartz|silica]] envelopes and/or [[graphite]] or [[zirconium]] coated [[tantalum]] plates which are intended to operate at glowing temperatures and thus employ ''radiation cooling''. The zirconium plate coating acts as a [[getter]], and proper getter action in these tubes depends on the plate running at high temperatures. Such tubes may develop excessive gas content if underloaded for long periods of time. One trade name for this type of plate coating is [[Eimac]]'s &quot;pyrovac&quot;.

==Causes==
In consumer equipment, it is usually a sign of a [[short circuit|short]]ed or badly mistuned [[external electric load|load]], or a badly out-of-bias condition. When testing, repairing or restoring vacuum tube-based equipment, it is wise to watch the plates of all the tubes for this condition.

==Dangers==
If the tube is overloaded, not only can the plate warp, causing a short to outer grids or beam-shaping elements, but the [[emissive layer]] on the [[cathode]] will be consumed very quickly. The equipment's power supply and the tube's load ([[output transformer]]s, [[flyback transformer]]s, etc.) are likely to be damaged by a sustained overload condition, so power should be immediately disconnected when a glowing plate is found.

==Common Occurrences==
In modern-day repair and maintenance of early tube-based consumer electronics devices, a glowing plate will be rarely encountered. As a visible symptom of a destructive failure, checking for an overheated tube is essential to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the equipment undergoing maintenance. 

Most frequently, a glowing plate overload will be found in rectifiers and output tubes. In particular: 
*[[Rectifier]] tubes (5U4, 80, etc.), usually due to shorted [[capacitor]]s or other substantial short circuits within the device. The power supply's output may be easily disconnected from the rest of the circuit in order to determine whether the overload is occurring in the supply or elsewhere.
*Horizontal and vertical output tubes in television sets (6CD6, 21LU8, etc.), usually due to a shorted coupling capacitor upsetting the bias or the driving [[oscillator]] operating well out of its design range. [[Deflection yoke]]s are sometimes faulty.
**Horizontal output tubes may also be overloaded by a flyback transformer with shorted turns, a defective damper (i.e. 6W4), high voltage rectifier (i.e. 1B3) or high voltage regulator (i.e. 6BK4) tube.
**Early color television receivers also used a complex dynamic convergence system, which was driven by both the horizontal and vertical output stages. Failure of part of this system could overload either tube, though this author has never seen such a failure in person.
*Audio output tubes in radios, stereos, public address systems and guitar amplifiers (50C5, 6L6, etc.), usually due to a bad coupling capacitor upsetting the bias or a shorted load.

If any tube presents a glowing plate, the equipment should be shut down immediately to avoid further damage.

==History==
The company began as E. Machlett and Son, which was founded in 1897 in [[New York]], [[United States]] as scientific glass makers.

===Early days===
Machlett Laboratories was created from E. Machlett &amp; Sons in order to exploit the then new technology of [[X-rays]]. They made X-ray tubes from the beginning to 1989 when they were bought by [[Varian Associates|Varian]]. In addition to making X-ray tubes, they manufactured high-power [[vacuum tubes]] for use in [[radio]] and [[TV]] [[broadcasting]] (857B mercury-vapor half-wave rectifier tube) and for industrial [[induction heating]]. Those two sides of the business were about equivalent for most of the life of the company.

Machlett Laboratories, Inc. was established on Hope Street and Camp Avenue in 1934. This manufacturing operation began making X-ray tubes and became the largest producer of its kind in the world. Raymond was president of the company, founded by his father Robert, a scientist who made the first practical X-ray tube in America and devoted his life to making it safe and successful in the field of medicine. Robert Machlett associated with Madame Curie and other leading roentgenologists to make this happen.

They moved to 1063 Hope St. in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]], in the early 20th century, and remained there. Among their achievements was a counter made by them for [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irene]] and [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Frederic Joliot-Curie]] for use in their experiments on artificial [[radioactivity]] in 1934 which is currently contained in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in Great Britain. They were given an “E” award by the US government in 1945 for their contribution to the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamfordhistory.org/ww2_machlett.htm] no longer at 1063 Hope St.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmitting tubes===
[[File:Machlett 298A radio transmission tube.JPG|thumb|Machlett Labs 298A radio transmission tube, ca. 1958.  This was the largest transmission tube made.  This one is on display at the Georgia Museum of Radio History in St. Marys, GA, USA.]]
Machlett was well known for its rather complete line of transmitting tubes, most particularly [[triode]]s.

For quite a while, Machlett's 6697s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.datasheetarchive.com/ML-6697A-datasheet.html&lt;/ref&gt; were the most-used Class B modulator tubes (as a push-pull pair) and Class C final tubes (as a single-ended pair) in 50,000-watt plate-modulated AM transmitters.

In a classical [[Doherty amplifier]] (a Class B &quot;carrier&quot; tube and a Class C &quot;peak&quot; tube), 50,000 watts could be achieved using only two 6697s, but the drive requirement was about 5,000 watts, so the driver was often a complete 5,000-watt transmitter. The driver power could be &quot;passed through&quot; (i.e., was not dissipated as heat) if the carrier tube was operated with a grounded grid and, as before, the peak tube was operated with a grounded cathode.&lt;ref&gt;Continental Electronics 317B&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, chief competitor [[Eimac]] released [[tetrode]]s which rather quickly eclipsed Machlett's triodes, as tetrodes have higher gain (thereby requiring much lower driver power, usually about 1,000 watts for 50,000 watts out), and do not require &quot;neutralization&quot;. And tetrodes can be screen-grid modulated, especially in a Sainton-modified Doherty amplifier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt; where both the &quot;carrier&quot; and &quot;peak&quot; tubes may be operated in Class C.&lt;ref&gt;Continental Electronics 317C&lt;/ref&gt;

6697s were also employed in RCA's upgraded [[Ampliphase]] transmitter, the BTA-50H.

[[CPI International|CPI]]'s Econo division remanufactures Eimac and Machlett power tubes.

===X-ray tubes===
They were the first company to utilize the concept of the rotating anode, something which is just about universal in medical X-ray systems at this date. Towards the end of the time of manufacture, they were producing oil-circulating X-ray tubes with a [[heat exchanger]]  attached (for use with [[computed tomography]] (CT) scanners), with 5-inch diameter rotating anodes formed from tungsten-rhenium alloy and [[molybdenum]], with a large mass of [[graphite]] attached to act as a [[heat sink]]. Smaller tubes without graphite heat sinks had highly radiative coatings to disperse the generated heat into the oil surrounding the tube itself.

The manufacture of X-ray tubes was licensed to two other companies, [[GEC Medical]] and Comet SA of [[Bern]] in [[Switzerland]].

====Machlett X-ray tube====
The Machlett X-ray tube was produced to ‘provide electrostatic protection for the filament (cathode) so as to permit long life to be achieved at operating voltages in the range 100-300 kV’ i .
The X-ray tube was designed and manufactured by E. Machlett &amp; Son who were specialists in scientific glass instruments. The American company, who were established in New York 1897, began as a single shop and soon grew into an internationally recognized firm. The Machlett X-ray tube was patented in April 1934, with the object at the School of Physics being dated to 1937. It is possible that the X-ray tubes were used by Professor T.H Laby’s X-ray group ii.
The development of the X-ray appears early on to have been a priority research topic at the University of Melbourne’s School of Physics. This interest was sparked by the appointment in 1889 of Professor T. R. Lyle. Lyle, who was head of the school until 1915, is thought to have been the first person in Australia to have taken a X-ray photograph iii. A photocopy of this photograph can be found in the School of Physics Archive. For this particular experiment, Lyle actually made his own x-ray tube. His successor, Laby, continued to work with X-rays. During the 1920s he worked on the X-ray spectra of atoms and in 1930 he, along with Dr C. E. Eddy, published ''Quantitative Analysis by X-Ray Spectroscopy'' iv . Also with Eddy Laby produced the paper &quot;Sensitivity of Atomic Analysis by X-rays&quot;. Laby went on to have a X-ray spectrograph of his own design manufactured by Adam Hilger Ltd.

===Accessories===
As well as X-ray tubes, they manufactured collimators – to define the beam size – and three marks of “Dynalyser” – an invasive instrument for measuring all the important parameters in an X-ray tube. This consisted of an HV unit insulated with [[Sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], and an indicating unit. A separate radiation monitor could be used with this, and an oscilloscope could also be attached to this device if desired. Some 2,500 of the most recent version were sold, and this device survived the sale of the company to Varian and later buyers, being in production from the early 1980s to around 1995.

There were three generations of the Dynalyzer produced. Maintenance on the Dynalyzer is available by its inventor, Dr. Jon Shapiro, at http://giciman.com

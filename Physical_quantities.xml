      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7454">The [[American Petroleum Institute]] gravity, or '''API gravity''', is a measure of how heavy or light a [[petroleum]] liquid is compared to water: if its API gravity is greater than 10, it is lighter and floats on water; if less than 10, it is heavier and sinks.

API gravity is thus an inverse measure of a petroleum liquid's [[density]] relative to that of water (also known as [[specific gravity]]). It is used to compare densities of [[List of crude oil products|petroleum liquids]]. For example, if one petroleum liquid is less dense than another, it has a greater API gravity. Although mathematically, API gravity is a [[dimensionless quantity]], see the formula below, it is referred to as being in 'degrees'. API gravity is gradated in degrees on a [[#Direct Measurement of API gravity (Hydrometer method)|hydrometer instrument]]. API gravity values of most petroleum liquids  fall between 10 and 70 degrees.

==History of development==
In 1916, the U.S. [[National Bureau of Standards]] accepted the [[Baumé scale]], which had been developed in France in 1768, as the U.S. standard for measuring the [[specific gravity]] of liquids less dense than [[Density of water|water]]. Investigation by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences found major errors in [[salinity]] and temperature controls that had caused serious variations in published values. Hydrometers in the U.S. had been manufactured and distributed widely with a modulus of 141.5 instead of the Baumé scale modulus of 140. The scale was so firmly established that, by 1921, the remedy implemented by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] was to create the API gravity scale, recognizing the scale that was actually being used.

==API gravity formulas==
The formula to calculate API gravity from [[Specific Gravity]] (SG) is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{API gravity} = \frac{141.5}{\text{SG}} - 131.5&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, the specific gravity of petroleum liquids can be derived from their API gravity value as

:&lt;math&gt;\text{SG at}~60^\circ\text{F} = \frac{141.5}{\text{API gravity} + 131.5}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a heavy oil with a specific gravity of 1.0 (i.e., with the same density as pure water at 60&amp;nbsp;°F) has an API gravity of:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{141.5}{1.0} - 131.5 = 10.0^\circ{\text{API}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Using API gravity to calculate barrels of crude oil per metric ton==
In the oil industry, quantities of crude oil are often measured in metric [[tonne|ton]]s. One can calculate the approximate number of [[Barrel_(unit)#Oil_barrel|barrels]] per metric ton for a given crude oil based on its API gravity:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{barrels of crude oil per metric ton} = \frac{\text{API gravity}+131.5}{141.5\times 0.159}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a metric ton of [[West Texas Intermediate]] (39.6° API) has a volume of about 7.6 barrels.

==Measurement of API gravity from its specific gravity==
To derive the API gravity, the specific gravity (i.e., density relative to water) is first measured using either the [[hydrometer]], detailed in [[ASTM]] D1298 or with the [[oscillating U-tube]] method detailed in ASTM D4052.

Density adjustments at different temperatures, corrections for soda-lime glass expansion and contraction and [[meniscus]] corrections for opaque oils are detailed in the [[Petroleum Measurement Tables]], details of usage specified in ASTM D1250. The specific gravity is defined by the formula below.

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{SG oil} = \frac{\rho_\text{oil}}{\rho_{\text{H}_2\text{O}}}&lt;/math&gt;

With the formula presented in the previous section, the API gravity can be readily calculated. When converting oil density to specific gravity using the above definition, it is important to use the correct density of water, according to the standard conditions used when the measurement was made. The official density of water at 60&amp;nbsp;°F according to the 2008 edition of ASTM D1250 is 999.016&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Report on the Development, Construction, Calculation and Preparation of the ASTM – IP Petroleum Measurement Tables (ASTM D1250; IP 200), 1960, published by the Institute of Petroleum, 61 New Cavendish Street, London, W.1 and American Society for Testing Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia 3, Pa.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 value is 999.012&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;API Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards, Chapter 11.1 – 1980,Volume XI/XII, Adjunct to: ASTM D1250-80 and IP 200/80&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the standard conditions may be 15&amp;nbsp;°C (59&amp;nbsp;°F) and not 60&amp;nbsp;°F (15.56&amp;nbsp;°C), in which case a different value for the water density would be appropriate (''see'' [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]]).

==Direct Measurement of API gravity (Hydrometer method)==

There are advantages to field testing and on-board conversion of measured volumes to volume correction.
This method is detailed in ASTM D287.

==Classifications or grades==
Generally speaking, oil with an API gravity between 40 and 45° commands the highest prices. Above 45°, the molecular chains become shorter and less valuable to refineries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comments on Crude Oil Gravity Adjustments|url=http://dnr.louisiana.gov/sec/execdiv/techasmt/oil_gas/crude_oil_gravity/comments_1989.htm|publisher=Louisiana Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=6 January 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070118001025/http://dnr.louisiana.gov/sec/execdiv/techasmt/oil_gas/crude_oil_gravity/comments_1989.htm|archivedate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crude oil]] is classified as light, medium, or heavy according to its measured API gravity.

* [[Light crude oil]] has an API gravity higher than 31.1° (i.e., less than 870&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* Medium oil has an API gravity between 22.3 and 31.1° (i.e., 870 to 920&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Heavy crude oil]] has an API gravity below 22.3° (i.e., 920 to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* Extra heavy oil has an API gravity below 10.0° (i.e., greater than 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

However, not all parties use the same grading.&lt;ref&gt;Crude oil grades, Crudemonitor.ca, web PDF file: [http://www.crudemonitor.ca/quickfacts/misc/grades.pdf CMonitor-Gr-PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Geological Survey]] uses slightly different ranges.&lt;ref&gt;USGS FS2006-3133_508, web PDF file: [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2006/3133/pdf/FS2006-3133_508.pdf USGS-508-PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crude oil with API gravity less than 10° is referred to as [[extra heavy oil]] or [[bitumen]]. Bitumen derived from [[oil sands]] deposits in Alberta, Canada, has an API gravity of around 8°. It can be diluted with lighter hydrocarbons to produce [[diluted bitumen]], which has an API gravity of less than 22.3°, or further &quot;upgraded&quot; to an API gravity of 31 to 33° as [[synthetic crude]].&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Centre for Energy Information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8832">'''Absorbed dose''' is a physical dose quantity '' D '' representing the mean energy imparted to [[matter]] per unit mass by [[ionizing radiation]]. 
In the SI system of units, the unit of measure is joules per kilogram, and its special name is [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy).&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, glossary&lt;/ref&gt; The non-SI [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] unit [[rad (unit)|rad]] is sometimes also used, predominantly in the USA.

==Uses==
[[File:Dose_quantities_and_units.png|thumb|400px|External dose quantities used in radiation protection and dosimetry]]

Absorbed dose is used in the calculation of dose uptake in living tissue in both [[radiation protection]] and [[radiology]]. It is also used to directly compare the effect of radiation on inanimate matter.
 
===Radiological protection===
The quantity absorbed dose is of fundamental importance in radiological protection for calculating radiation dose. However, absorbed dose is a physical quantity and used unmodified is not an adequate indicator of the likely health effects in humans.

It has been found that for [[stochastic]] radiation risk (defined as ''probability'' of cancer induction and genetic effects) consideration must be given to the type of radiation and the sensitivity of the irradiated tissues, which requires the use of modifying factors. Conventionally therefore, unmodified absorbed dose is not used for comparing stochastic risks but only used to compare against [[deterministic]] effects (''severity'' of acute tissue effects that are certain to happen) such as in [[acute radiation syndrome]].

To represent stochastic risk the [[equivalent dose]] ''H'' &lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and [[Effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] ''E'' are used, and appropriate dose factors and coefficients are used to calculate these from the absorbed dose.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraphs 104 and 105&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalent and effective dose quantities are expressed in units of the [[sievert]] or [[rem (unit)|rem]] which implies that biological effects have been taken into account. These are usually in accordance with the recommendations of the [[ICRP|International Committee on Radiation Protection]] (ICRP) and [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU). The coherent system of radiological protection quantities developed by them is shown in the accompanying diagram.

===Radiology===
The measurement of absorbed dose in tissue is of fundamental importance in [[radiobiology]] and [[radiation therapy]] as it is the measure of the amount of energy the incident radiation is imparting to the target tissue.

===Component survivability===
Absorbed dose is used to rate the survivability of devices such as electronic components in ionizing radiation environments.
===Food irradiation===
[[File:Radura international.svg|thumb|150px|right|The international [[Radura]] logo, used to show a food has been treated with ionizing radiation.]]
Absorbed dose is the physical dose quantity used to ensure [[irradiated food]] has received the correct dose to ensure effectiveness. Variable doses are used depending on the application and can be as high as 70&amp;nbsp;kGy.

==Computation==
The absorbed dose is equal to the radiation exposure (ions or [[coulomb|C]]/kg) of the radiation beam multiplied by the ionization energy of the medium to be ionized.

For example, the ionization energy of dry air at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 101.325&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|kPa]] of pressure is {{val|33.97|0.06|u=J/c}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radiation Oncology Physics: A Handbook for Teachers and Students|year=2005|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|location=Vienna|isbn=92-0-107304-6|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub1196_web.pdf|editor=Podgorsak, E. B.|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|305}} (33.97&amp;nbsp;eV per ion pair) Therefore an exposure of {{val|2.58|e=-4|u=C/kg}} (1 [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]]) would deposit an absorbed dose of {{val|8.76|e=-3|u=J/kg}} (0.00876&amp;nbsp;Gy or 0.876&amp;nbsp;rad) in dry air at those conditions.

When the absorbed dose is not uniform, or when it is only applied to a portion of a body or object, an absorbed dose representative of the entire item can be calculated by taking a mass-weighted average of the absorbed doses at each point.

More precisely,&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRP103&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection|journal=Annals of the ICRP|year=2007|volume=37|series=ICRP publication 103|issue=2-4|url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103|accessdate=17 May 2012|isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bar{D_T}=\frac{\int_{T}D(x,y,z)\rho(x,y,z)dV}{\int_{T}\rho(x,y,z)dV}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{D_T}&lt;/math&gt;  is the mass-averaged absorbed dose of the entire item T
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;  is the item of interest
:&lt;math&gt;D(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;  is the absorbed dose as a function of location
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;  is the density as a function of location
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;  is volume

===Medical considerations===
Non-uniform absorbed dose is common for soft radiations such as low energy x-rays or beta radiation. Self-shielding means that the absorbed dose will be higher in the tissues facing the source than deeper in the body.

The mass average can be important in evaluating the risks of radiotherapy treatments, since they are designed to target very specific volumes in the body, typically a tumour. For example, if 10% of a patient's bone marrow mass is irradiated with 10&amp;nbsp;Gy of radiation locally, then the absorbed dose in bone marrow overall would be 1&amp;nbsp;Gy. Bone marrow makes up 4% of the body mass, so the whole-body absorbed dose would be 0.04&amp;nbsp;Gy. The first figure (10&amp;nbsp;Gy) is indicative of the local effects on the tumour, while the second and third figure (1&amp;nbsp;Gy and 0.04&amp;nbsp;Gy) are better indicators of the overall health effects on the whole organism. Additional dosimetry calculations would have to be performed on these figures to arrive at a meaningful effective dose, which is needed to estimate the risk of cancer or other stochastic effects.

When ionizing radiation is used to treat cancer, the doctor will usually prescribe the [[radiotherapy]] treatment in units of gray. [[Medical imaging]] doses may be described in units of [[coulomb]] per [[kilogram]], but when [[radiopharmaceutical]]s are used, they will usually be administered in units of [[becquerel]].

{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}
'''Angular acceleration''' is the rate of change of [[angular velocity]]. In [[SI]] units, it is measured in [[radian]]s per [[second]] squared (rad/s{{sup|2}}), and is usually denoted by the Greek letter [[alpha (letter)|alpha]] (''α'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/physics/circ/node3.html |title=Angular Velocity and Acceleration |publisher=Theory.uwinnipeg.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical definition ==

The angular acceleration can be defined as either:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha} = \frac{{d\omega}}{dt} = \frac{d^2{\theta}}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt; , or

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha} = \frac{a_T}{r}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular velocity]], &lt;math&gt;a_T&lt;/math&gt; is the linear [[tangential acceleration]], and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, (usually defined as the radius of the circular path of which a point moving along), is the distance from the origin of the [[coordinate system]] that defines &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to the point of interest.

== Equations of motion ==
For two-dimensional [[rotation|rotational motion]] (constant &lt;math&gt;\hat L&lt;/math&gt;), [[Newton's second law]] can be adapted to describe the relation between [[torque]] and angular acceleration:

:&lt;math&gt;{\tau} = I\ {\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; ,
where &lt;math&gt;{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; is the total torque exerted on the body, and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Moment of inertia|mass moment of inertia]] of the body.

===Constant acceleration===
For all constant values of the torque, &lt;math&gt;{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;, of an object, the angular acceleration will also be constant.  For this special case of constant angular acceleration, the above equation will produce a definitive, constant value for the angular acceleration:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha} = \frac{\tau}{I}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-constant acceleration===

For any non-constant torque, the angular acceleration of an object will change with time. The equation becomes a differential equation instead of a constant value. This [[differential equation]] is known as the equation of motion of the system and can completely describe the motion of the object. It is also the best way to calculate the angular velocity.

In [[classical mechanics]], '''areal velocity''' (also called '''sector velocity''' or '''sectorial velocity''') is the rate at which [[area]] is swept out by a particle as it moves along a [[curve]]. In the adjoining figure, suppose that a particle moves along the blue curve. At a certain time ''t'', the particle is located at point ''B'', and a short while later, at time ''t'' + Δ''t'', the particle has moved to point ''C''. The area swept out by the particle is the green area in the figure, bounded by the line segments ''AB'' and ''AC'' and the curve along which the particle moves. The areal velocity equals this area divided by the time interval Δ''t'' in the limit that Δ''t'' becomes vanishingly small.

[[Image:kepler-second-law.gif|right|thumb|Illustration of Kepler's second law. The planet moves faster near the Sun, so the same area is swept out in a given time as at larger distances, where the planet moves more slowly.]]
The concept of areal velocity is closely linked historically with the concept of [[angular momentum]].  [[Kepler's second law]] states that the areal velocity of a planet, with the sun taken as origin, is constant. [[Isaac Newton]] was the first scientist to recognize the dynamical significance of Kepler's second law.  With the aid of his laws of motion, he proved in 1684 that any planet that is attracted to a fixed center sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.  By the middle of the 18th century, the principle of angular momentum was discovered gradually by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Patrick d'Arcy]]; d'Arcy's version of the principle was phrased in terms of swept area.  For this reason, the principle of angular momentum was often referred to in the older literature in mechanics as &quot;the principle of areas.&quot;  Since the concept of angular momentum includes more than just geometry, the designation &quot;principle of areas&quot; has been dropped in modern works.

== Connection with angular momentum ==

In the situation of the first figure, the area swept out during time period Δ''t'' by the particle is approximately equal to the area of triangle ''ABC''.  As ''Δt'' approaches zero this near-equality becomes exact as a [[limit of a function|limit]].

Let the point ''D'' be the fourth corner of parallelogram ''ABDC'' shown in the figure, so that the vectors ''AB'' and ''AC'' add up by the parallelogram rule to vector ''AD''. Then the area of triangle ''ABC'' is half the area of parallelogram ''ABDC'', and the area of ''ABDC'' is equal to the magnitude of the [[cross product]] of vectors ''AB'' and ''AC''.  This area can also be viewed as a vector with this magnitude, pointing in a direction perpendicular to the parallelogram; this vector is the cross product itself:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{vector area of parallelogram }ABCD = \vec{r}(t) \times \vec{r}(t + \Delta t). &lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt; \text{vector area of triangle }ABC = \frac{\vec{r}(t) \times \vec{r}(t + \Delta t)}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

The areal velocity is this area divided by Δ''t'' in the limit that Δ''t'' becomes vanishingly small:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\text{areal velocity} &amp;=  \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\vec{r}(t) \times \vec{r}(t + \Delta t)}{2 \Delta t} \\
&amp;= \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\vec{r}(t) \times \bigl( \vec{r}(t) + \vec{r}\,'(t) \Delta t \bigr)}{2 \Delta t} \\
&amp;= \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\vec{r}(t) \times \vec{r}\,'(t)}{2} \left( {\Delta t \over \Delta t} \right) \\
&amp;= \frac{\vec{r}(t) \times \vec{r}\,'(t)}{2}. 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

But, &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}\,'(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}(t)&lt;/math&gt; of the moving particle, so that

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d \vec{A}}{d t} = \frac{\vec{r} \times \vec{v}}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, the angular momentum of the particle is
 
:&lt;math&gt; \vec{L} = \vec{r} \times m \vec{v}, &lt;/math&gt;

and hence the angular momentum equals 2''m'' times the areal velocity.

Conservation of areal velocity is a general property of [[central force motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.uwo.ca/~houde/courses/phy350a/Central_force.pdf|title= Chapter 6. Central Force Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the &quot;mass attenuation coefficient&quot;, see the article [[mass attenuation coefficient]].

'''Attenuation coefficient''' or '''narrow beam attenuation coefficient''' of the volume of a material characterizes how easily it can be penetrated by a beam of [[light]], [[sound]], [[particle]]s, or other [[energy]] or [[matter]].&lt;ref name=GoldBook&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Attenuation coefficient|file=A00516|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large attenuation coefficient means that the beam is quickly &quot;attenuated&quot; (weakened) as it passes through the medium, and a small attenuation coefficient means that the medium is relatively [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to the beam. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of attenuation coefficient is the [[reciprocal metre]] (m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). '''Extinction coefficient''' is an old term for this quantity,&lt;ref name=GoldBook /&gt; but still used in meteorology and climatology &lt;ref name=&quot;AMSGlossary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Extinction_coefficient|title=2nd Edition of the Glossary of Meteorology|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Attenuation coefficient describes the extent to which the [[radiant flux]] of a beam is reduced as it passes through a specific material. It is used in the context of
*[[X-ray]]s or [[Gamma ray]]s, where it is denoted ''μ'' and measured in cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;;
*[[neutron]]s and [[nuclear reactor]]s, where it is called ''macroscopic cross section'' (although actually it is not a section dimensionally speaking), denoted ''Σ'' and measured in m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;;
*[[ultrasound attenuation]], where it is denoted ''α'' and measured in [[Decibel|dB]]·cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·MHz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;ISO 20998-1:2006 &quot;Measurement and characterization of particles by acoustic methods&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2002&quot;&gt;Dukhin, A.S. and Goetz, P.J. &quot;Ultrasound for characterizing colloids&quot;, Elsevier, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[acoustics]] for characterizing [[particle size distribution]], where it is denoted ''α'' and measured in m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The attenuation coefficient is called the [[extinction coefficient]] in the context of
*[[Visible spectrum|solar]] and [[infrared]] radiative transfer in the [[atmosphere]], albeit usually denoted with another symbol (given the standard use of {{nobreak|1=''μ'' = cos ''θ''}} for slant paths);

A small attenuation coefficient indicates that the material in question is relatively [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], while a larger value indicates greater degrees of [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]]. The attenuation coefficient is dependent upon the type of material and the energy of the radiation. Generally, for electromagnetic radiation, the higher the energy of the incident photons and the less dense the material in question, the lower the corresponding attenuation coefficient will be.

==Mathematical definitions==

===Hemispherical attenuation coefficient===
'''Hemispherical attenuation coefficient''' of a volume, denoted ''μ'', is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16943|title=Thermal insulation — Heat transfer by radiation — Physical quantities and definitions|work=ISO 9288:1989|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] catalogue|year=1989|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = -\frac{1}{\Phi_\mathrm{e}} \frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\mathrm{d}z},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[radiant flux]];
*''z'' is the path length of the beam.

===Spectral hemispherical attenuation coefficient===
'''Spectral hemispherical attenuation coefficient in frequency''' and '''spectral hemispherical attenuation coefficient in wavelength''' of a volume, denoted ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, are defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\nu = -\frac{1}{\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu}} \frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu}}{\mathrm{d}z},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\lambda = -\frac{1}{\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}} \frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}}{\mathrm{d}z},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,ν&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Radiant flux|spectral radiant flux in frequency]];
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,λ&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Radiant flux|spectral radiant flux in wavelength]].

===Directional attenuation coefficient===
'''Directional attenuation coefficient''' of a volume, denoted ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;Ω&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\Omega = -\frac{1}{L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega}} \frac{\mathrm{d}L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega}}{\mathrm{d}z},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[radiance]].

===Spectral directional attenuation coefficient===
'''Spectral directional attenuation coefficient in frequency''' and '''spectral directional attenuation coefficient in wavelength''' of a volume, denoted ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;Ω,ν&lt;/sub&gt; and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;Ω,λ&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, are defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\Omega,\nu} = -\frac{1}{L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega,\nu}} \frac{\mathrm{d}L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega,\nu}}{\mathrm{d}z},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\Omega,\lambda} = -\frac{1}{L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega,\lambda}} \frac{\mathrm{d}L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega,\lambda}}{\mathrm{d}z},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''L''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω,ν&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Radiance|spectral radiance in frequency]];
*''L''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω,λ&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Radiance|spectral radiance in wavelength]].

==Absorption and scattering coefficients==
When a narrow ([[Collimated light|collimated]]) beam passes through a volume, the beam will lose intensity due to two processes: [[absorption]] and [[scattering]].

'''Absorption coefficient''' of a volume, denoted ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''scattering coefficient''' of a volume, denoted ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, are defined the same way as for attenuation coefficient.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;

Attenuation coefficient of a volume is the sum of absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient:&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu_\mathrm{a} + \mu_\mathrm{s},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\nu = \mu_{\mathrm{a},\nu} + \mu_{\mathrm{s},\nu},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\lambda = \mu_{\mathrm{a},\lambda} + \mu_{\mathrm{s},\lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\Omega = \mu_{\mathrm{a},\Omega} + \mu_{\mathrm{s},\Omega},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\Omega,\nu} = \mu_{\mathrm{a},\Omega,\nu} + \mu_{\mathrm{s},\Omega,\nu},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\Omega,\lambda} = \mu_{\mathrm{a},\Omega,\lambda} + \mu_{\mathrm{s},\Omega,\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

Just looking at the narrow beam itself, the two processes cannot be distinguished. However, if a detector is set up to measure beam leaving in different directions, or conversely using a non-narrow beam, one can measure how much of the lost radiant flux was scattered, and how much was absorbed.

In this context, the &quot;absorption coefficient&quot; measures how quickly the beam would lose radiant flux due to the absorption ''alone'', while &quot;attenuation coefficient&quot; measures the ''total'' loss of narrow-beam intensity, including scattering as well. &quot;Narrow-beam attenuation coefficient&quot; always unambiguously refers to the latter. The attenuation coefficient is always larger than the absorption coefficient, although they are equal in the idealized case of no scattering.

==Mass attenuation, absorption, and scattering coefficients==
{{main|Mass attenuation coefficient}}
'''Mass attenuation coefficient''', '''mass absorption coefficient''', and '''mass scattering coefficient''' are defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu}{\rho_m},\quad \frac{\mu_\mathrm{a}}{\rho_m},\quad \frac{\mu_\mathrm{s}}{\rho_m},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[mass density]].

==Napierian and decadic attenuation coefficients==
'''Decadic attenuation coefficient''' or '''decadic narrow beam attenuation coefficient''', denoted ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{10} = \frac{\mu}{\ln 10}.&lt;/math&gt;

''μ'' is sometimes called '''Napierian attenuation coefficient''' or '''Napierian narrow beam attenuation coefficient''' rather than just simply &quot;attenuation coefficient&quot;. The terms &quot;decadic&quot; and &quot;Napierian&quot; come from the base used for the [[Exponential function|exponential]] in the [[Beer–Lambert law]] for a material sample, in which the two attenuation coefficients take part:
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\int_0^\ell \mu(z)\mathrm{d}z} = 10^{-\int_0^\ell \mu_{10}(z)\mathrm{d}z},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''T'' is the [[transmittance]] of the material sample;
*''ℓ'' is the path length of the beam of light through the material sample.

In case of ''uniform'' attenuation, these relations become
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\mu\ell} = 10^{-\mu_{10}\ell}.&lt;/math&gt;
Cases of ''non-uniform'' attenuation occur in [[atmospheric science]] applications and [[radiation shielding]] theory for instance.

The (Napierian) attenuation coefficient and the decadic attenuation coefficient of a material sample are related to the [[Number density|number densities]] and the [[amount concentration]]s of its ''N'' attenuating species as
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \mu_i(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i n_i(z),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{10}(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \mu_{10,i}(z) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i c_i(z),&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Cross section (physics)|attenuation cross section]] of the attenuating specie ''i'' in the material sample;
*''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[number density]] of the attenuating specie ''i'' in the material sample;
*''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[molar attenuation coefficient]] of the attenuating specie ''i'' in the material sample;
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[amount concentration]] of the attenuating specie ''i'' in the material sample,
by definition of attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient.

Attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient are related by
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i = \frac{\mathrm{N_A}}{\ln{10}}\,\sigma_i,&lt;/math&gt;
and number density and amount concentration by
:&lt;math&gt;c_i = \frac{n_i}{\mathrm{N_A}},&lt;/math&gt;
where N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]].

The [[half-value layer]] (HVL) is the thickness of a layer of material required to reduce the radiant flux of the transmitted radiation to half its incident magnitude. The half-value layer is about 69% (ln 2) of the [[penetration depth]]. It is from these equations that engineers decide how much protection is needed for &quot;safety&quot; from potentially harmful radiation.

Attenuation coefficient is also inversely related to [[mean free path]]. Moreover, it is very closely related to the [[Cross section (physics)|attenuation cross section]].

'''Bollard pull''' is a conventional measure of the pulling (or towing) power of a [[watercraft]]. It is defined as the [[force]] (in [[Ton#Units of force|tons]] or kiloNewtons (kN)) exerted by a [[Marine vessel|vessel]] under full power, on a shore-mounted [[bollard]] through a tow-line, commonly measured in a practical test (but sometimes simulated) under test conditions that include calm water, no [[tide]], level trim, and sufficient depth and side clearance for a free [[propeller]] stream. Like the [[horsepower]] or [[Fuel economy in automobiles|mileage]] rating of a car, it is a convenient but idealized number that must be adjusted for operating conditions that differ from the test.  The bollard pull of a vessel may be reported as two numbers, the ''static'' or ''maximum'' bollard pull - the highest force measured - and the ''steady'' or ''continuous'' bollard pull, the average of measurements over an interval of, for example, 10 minutes. An equivalent measurement on land is known as [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]] [[Drawbar pull|pull]], or [[tractive force]], which is used to measure the total horizontal force generated by a [[locomotive]], a piece of [[heavy machinery]] such as a [[tractor]], or a [[truck]], (specifically a [[ballast tractor]]), which is utilized to move a load.

Bollard pull is primarily (but not only) used for measuring the strength of [[tugboat]]s, with the largest commercial harbour tugboats in the 2000-2010s having around 60-65 tons of bollard pull, which is described as 15 tons above &quot;normal&quot; tugboats.&lt;ref name=ZOE&gt;{{cite news|title=Rotor Tug &quot;RT Zoe&quot;|url=http://www.marinelink.com/news/article/rotor-tug-rt-zoe/311274.aspx|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=Marineline.com|date=13 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chittagong&gt;{{cite news|title=Western Marine to build tugboat, vessel for Ctg port|url=http://www.hawker.com.bd/news_details_print.php?news_id=213869|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Unlike in ground vehicles, the statement of installed [[horsepower]] is not sufficient to understand how strong a tug is - this is because other factors, like transmission losses, propulsion type, and propulsion system efficiency have an influence as well.

Bollard pull values are stated in [[Ton#Units of force|tons]] (written as TBP) or kiloNewtons (kN).&lt;ref&gt;Note the inherent conflict: the [[SI]] unit of force is the [[Newton (unit)|newton]]. Even accepting ton as a unit of force, the value of a ton or tonne can mean anything between 8.89 kN and 10.00 kN depending on the definition used.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
Values for bollard pull can be determined in two ways.

===Practical trial===

[[Image:Bollard pull idealized-2.svg|thumb|Figure 1: bollard pull trial under ideal (imaginary) conditions]]

This method is useful for one-off ship designs and smaller [[shipyard]]s. It is limited in precision - a number of boundary conditions need to be observed to obtain reliable results.  Summarizing the below requirements, practical bollard pull trials need to be conducted in a [[List of Panamax ports|deep water seaport]], ideally not at the mouth of a river, on a calm day with hardly any traffic.
* The ship needs to be in undisturbed water. [[Ocean current|Currents]] or strong [[wind]]s would falsify the measurement.
* The static [[force]] that intends to move the ship forward must only be generated by the [[friction]] between the [[propeller]] discharge race and the surrounding water. If the ship were too close to a wall, the measurement would be falsified.
* The ship must be in deep water. If there were any ground effect, the measurement would be falsified. The same holds true for [[propeller walk]].
* Water [[salinity]] must have a well-defined value, as it influences the specific weight of the water and thereby the [[mass]] moved by the propeller per unit of time.
* The geometry of the towing line must have a well-defined value. Ideally, one would expect it to be exactly horizontal and straight. This is impossible in reality, because
** the line falls into a [[catenary]] due to its weight;
** the two fixed points of the line, being the bollard on shore and the ship's towing hook or cleat, may not have the same height above water.
* Conditions must be static. The engine power, the [[Course (navigation)|heading]] of the ship, the conditions of the propeller discharge race and the tension in the towing line must have settled to a constant or near-constant value for a reliable measurement.
* One condition to watch out for is the formation of a [[short circuit]] in propeller discharge race. If part of the discharge race is sucked back into the propeller, efficiency decreases sharply. This could occur due to a trial that is performed in too shallow water or too close to a wall.

See Figure 2 for an illustration of error influences in a practical bollard pull trial. Note the difference in elevation of the ends of the line (the port bollard is higher than the ship's towing hook). Furthermore, there is the partial short circuit in propeller discharge current, the uneven trim of the ship and the short length of the tow line. All of these factors contribute to measurement error.

===Simulation===
This method eliminates much of the uncertainties of the practical trial. However, any numerical simulation also has an error margin. Furthermore, simulation tools and computer systems capable of determining bollard pull for a ship design are costly. Hence, this method makes sense for larger shipyards and for the design of a series of ships.

Both methods can be combined. Practical trials can be used to validate the result of numerical simulation.

==Human-powered vehicles==
Practical bollard pull tests under simplified conditions are conducted for [[human powered vehicles]]. There, bollard pull is often a category in competitions and gives an indication of the power train efficiency. Although conditions for such measurements are inaccurate in absolute terms, they are the same for all competitors. Hence, they can still be valid for comparing several craft.

[[Image:B-H loop.png|thumb|A family of hysteresis loops for grain-oriented electrical steel. ''B''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; denotes ''[[retentivity]]'' and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''coercivity''. Movement on the loops is counterclockwise.]]

In [[electrical engineering]] and [[materials science]], the '''coercivity''', also called the '''magnetic coercivity''', '''coercive field''' or '''coercive force''', is a measure of the ability of a [[ferromagnetic]] material to withstand an external [[magnetic field]] without becoming [[Magnetization|demagnetized]].  An analogous property, '''electric coercivity''', is the ability of a [[ferroelectric]] material to withstand an external [[electric field]] without becoming [[polarization density|depolarized]].

For [[ferromagnet|ferromagnetic material]] the coercivity is the intensity of the applied [[magnetic field]] required to reduce the [[magnetization]] of that material to zero ''after'' the magnetization of the sample has been driven to [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]]. Thus coercivity measures the resistance of a ferromagnetic material to becoming demagnetized.  Coercivity is usually measured in [[oersted]] or [[ampere]]/meter units and is denoted ''H''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;.  It can be measured using a [[B-H analyzer]] or [[magnetometer]].

Ferromagnetic materials with high coercivity are called magnetically ''hard'' materials, and are used to make [[permanent magnet]]s.  Materials with low coercivity are said to be magnetically ''soft''.  The latter are used in  [[transformer]] and [[inductor]] [[magnetic core|cores]], [[recording head]]s, [[microwave]] devices, and [[magnetic shielding]].

Typically the coercivity of a magnetic material is determined by measurement of the [[magnetic hysteresis]] loop, also called the ''magnetization curve'', as illustrated in the figure. The apparatus used to acquire the data is typically a [[vibrating sample magnetometer|vibrating-sample]] or alternating-gradient [[magnetometer]]. The applied field where the data line crosses zero is the coercivity. If an [[antiferromagnet]] is present in the sample, the coercivities measured in increasing and decreasing fields may be unequal as a result of the [[exchange bias]] effect.

The coercivity of a material depends on the time scale over which a magnetization curve is measured.  The magnetization of a material measured at an applied reversed field which is nominally smaller than the coercivity may, over a long time scale, slowly [[Relaxation (physics)|relax]] to zero.  Relaxation occurs when reversal of magnetization by domain wall motion is [[Arrhenius equation|thermally activated]] and is dominated by [[magnetic viscosity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaunt|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing value of coercivity at high frequencies is a serious obstacle to the increase of [[Bit rate|data rates]] in high-[[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] magnetic recording, compounded by the fact that increased storage density typically requires a higher coercivity in the media.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
{{clear}}

==Theory==
[[Image:Coercivity.png|thumb|The coercivity is a horizontal intercept of the hysteresis loop.]]
At the coercive field, the [[vector (geometry)|vector component]] of the magnetization of a ferromagnet measured along the applied field direction is zero.  There are two primary modes of [[magnetization reversal]]: [[single domain (magnetic)|single-domain]] rotation and [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]] motion. When the magnetization of a material reverses by rotation, the magnetization component along the applied field is zero because the vector points in a direction orthogonal to the applied field. When the magnetization reverses by domain wall motion, the net magnetization is small in every vector direction because the moments of all the individual domains sum to zero.  Magnetization curves dominated by rotation and [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]] are found in relatively perfect magnetic materials used in fundamental research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Genish|Kats|Klein|Reiner|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domain wall motion is a more important reversal mechanism in real engineering materials since defects like [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] and [[impurity|impurities]] serve as [[nucleation]] sites for reversed-magnetization domains.  The role of domain walls in determining coercivity is complex since defects may ''pin'' domain walls in addition to nucleating them.  The dynamics of domain walls in ferromagnets is similar to that of grain boundaries and [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] in [[metallurgy]] since both domain walls and grain boundaries are planar defects.

==Significance==
As with any [[hysteresis|hysteretic]] process, the area inside the magnetization curve during one cycle represents the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] that is performed on the material by the external field in reversing the magnetization, and is dissipated as heat. Common dissipative processes in magnetic materials include [[magnetostriction]] and domain wall motion. The coercivity is a measure of the degree of magnetic hysteresis and therefore characterizes the lossiness of soft magnetic materials for their common applications.

The ''squareness'' ([[Remanence|saturation remanence]] divided by [[saturation magnetization]]) and coercivity are figures of merit for hard magnets although ''energy product'' (saturation magnetization times coercivity) is most commonly quoted. The 1980s saw the development of [[rare-earth magnet]]s with high energy products but undesirably low [[Curie temperature]]s. Since the 1990s new [[exchange spring magnet|exchange spring]] hard magnets with high coercivities have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kneller|Hawig|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mechanics]], a '''couple''' is a system of [[force]]s with a resultant (a.k.a. net or sum) [[torque|moment]] but no resultant force.&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;''Dynamics, Theory and Applications'' by T.R. Kane and D.A. Levinson, 1985, pp. 90-99: [http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/638 Free download]&lt;/ref&gt; A better term is '''force couple''' or '''pure moment'''. Its effect is to create [[rotation]] without [[Translation_(physics)|translation]], or more generally without any acceleration of the [[center of mass|centre of mass]].  In [[rigid body dynamics|rigid body mechanics]], force couples are ''free vectors'', meaning their effects on a body are independent of the point of application.

The resultant moment of a couple is called a '''torque'''. This is not to be confused with the term [[torque]] as it is used in physics, where it is merely a synonym of moment.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics for Engineering'' by Hendricks, Subramony, and Van Blerk, page 148, [http://books.google.com/books?id=8Kp-UwV4o0gC&amp;pg=PA148 Web link]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, torque is a ''special case'' of moment. Torque has special properties that moment does not have, in particular the property of being independent of reference point, as described below.

==Simple couple==
Definition-
A couple is a pair of forces, equal in magnitude, oppositely directed, and displaced by perpendicular distance or moment.

The simplest kind of couple consists of two equal and opposite [[force]]s whose [[line of action|lines of action]] do not coincide. This is called a &quot;simple couple&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kane/&gt; The forces have a turning effect or moment called a [[torque]] about an axis which is [[normal (geometry)|normal]] (perpendicular) to the plane of the forces. The [[SI unit]] for the torque of the couple is [[newton metre]].

If the two forces are '''F''' and '''−F''', then the [[Euclidean vector|magnitude]] of the torque is given by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau = F d \,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the torque
:''F'' is the magnitude of one of the forces
:''d'' is the perpendicular distance between the forces, sometimes called the ''arm'' of the couple

The magnitude of the torque is always equal to ''F d'', with the direction of the torque given by the [[unit vector]]  &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}&lt;/math&gt;, which is perpendicular to the plane containing the two forces. When '''d''' is taken as a vector between the points of action of the forces, then the couple is the [[cross product]] of '''d''' and '''F'''. I.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\tau} = \mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{F} .&lt;/math&gt;

==Independence of reference point==

The moment of a force is only defined with respect to a certain point ''P'' (it is said to be the &quot;moment about ''P''&quot;), and in general when ''P'' is changed, the moment changes. However, the moment (torque) of a ''couple'' is ''independent'' of the reference point ''P'': Any point will give the same moment.&lt;ref name=Kane/&gt; In other words, a torque vector, unlike any other moment vector, is a &quot;free vector&quot;.

(This fact is called ''Varignon's Second Moment Theorem''.)&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Mechanics: Equilibrium'', by C. Hartsuijker, J. W. Welleman, page 64 [http://books.google.com/books?id=oPhH90IWW60C&amp;pg=PA64 Web link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof of this claim is as follows: Suppose there are a set of force vectors '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. that form a couple, with position vectors (about some origin ''P'') '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc., respectively. The moment about ''P'' is
:&lt;math&gt;M = \mathbf{r}_1\times \mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{r}_2\times \mathbf{F}_2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Now we pick a new reference point ''P''' that differs from ''P'' by the vector '''r'''. The new moment is
:&lt;math&gt;M' = (\mathbf{r}_1+\mathbf{r})\times \mathbf{F}_1 + (\mathbf{r}_2+\mathbf{r})\times \mathbf{F}_2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
Now the [[distributive property]] of the [[cross product]] implies
:&lt;math&gt;M' = \left(\mathbf{r}_1\times \mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{r}_2\times \mathbf{F}_2 + \cdots\right) + \mathbf{r}\times \left(\mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{F}_2 + \cdots \right).&lt;/math&gt;
However, the definition of a force couple means that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{F}_2 + \cdots = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;M' = \mathbf{r}_1\times \mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{r}_2\times \mathbf{F}_2 + \cdots = M&lt;/math&gt;
This proves that the moment is independent of reference point, which is proof that a couple is a free vector.

==Forces and couples==
[[File:Force and couple.PNG |thumb]] 
A force ''F'' applied to a rigid body at a distance ''d'' from the center of mass has the same effect as the same force applied directly to the center of mass and a couple ''Cℓ = Fd''. The couple produces an angular acceleration of the rigid body at right angles to the plane of the couple.&lt;ref name=&quot;DuBois&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The mechanics of engineering, Volume 1 |author=Augustus Jay Du Bois |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=euUeAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA186 |page=186 |publisher=Wiley |year=1902}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The force at the center of mass accelerates the body in the direction of the force without change in orientation. The general theorems are:&lt;ref name=DuBois/&gt;
:A single force acting at any point ''O′'' of a rigid body can be replaced by an equal and parallel force ''F'' acting at any given point ''O'' and a couple with forces parallel to ''F'' whose moment is ''M = Fd'', ''d'' being the separation of ''O'' and ''O′''. Conversely, a couple and a force in the plane of the couple can be replaced by a single force, appropriately located.

:Any couple can be replaced by another in the same plane of the same direction and moment, having any desired force or any desired arm.&lt;ref name=DuBois/&gt;

==Applications==

Couples are very important in [[mechanical engineering]] and the physical sciences. A few examples are: 
* The forces exerted by one's hand on a screw-driver
* The forces exerted by the tip of a screw-driver on the head of a screw
* Drag forces acting on a spinning propeller
* Forces on an [[electric dipole]] in a uniform electric field.
* The [[reaction control system]] on a spacecraft.
In a [[liquid crystal]] it is the rotation of an [[optic axis]] called the ''director'' that produces the functionality of these compounds. As [[Jerald Ericksen]] explained
:At first glance, it may seem that it is optics or electronics which is involved, rather than mechanics. Actually, the changes in optical behavior, etc. are associated with changes in orientation. In turn, these are produced by couples. Very roughly, it is similar to bending a wire, by applying couples.&lt;ref&gt; J.L. Ericksen (1979) [http://imechanica.org/node/10396 Timoshenko Acceptance Speech] at iMechanica.org site for [[mechanician]]s&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|crystallinity|crystalline}}
'''Crystallinity''' refers to the degree of structural order in a [[solid]]. In a [[crystal]], the atoms or molecules are arranged in a regular, periodic manner. The degree of crystallinity has a big influence on [[hardness]], [[density]], [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]] and [[diffusion]]. In a gas, the relative positions of the atoms or molecules are completely random. Amorphous materials, such as [[liquids]] and [[glass]]es, represent an intermediate case, having order over short distances (a few atomic or molecular spacings) but not over longer distances.

Many materials, such as [[glass-ceramic]]s and some [[polymer]]s, can be prepared in such a way as to produce a mixture of crystalline and [[amorphous]] regions. In such cases, crystallinity is usually specified as a percentage of the volume of the material that is crystalline. Even within materials that are completely crystalline, however, the degree of structural perfection can vary. For instance, most metallic [[alloy]]s are crystalline, but they usually comprise many independent crystalline regions ([[grains or crystallites]]) in various orientations separated by [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]]; furthermore, they contain other [[crystal defect]]s (notably [[dislocation]]s) that reduce the degree of structural perfection. The most highly perfect crystals are silicon [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] produced for semiconductor electronics; these are large [[monocrystal|single crystals]] (so they have no grain boundaries), are nearly free of dislocations, and have precisely controlled concentrations of defect atoms.

Crystallinity can be measured using [[x-ray diffraction]], but calorimetric techniques are also commonly used.

== Rocks crystallinity ==
Geologists describe four qualitative levels of crystallinity:
* holocrystalline rocks are completely crystalline;
* hypocrystalline rocks are partially crystalline, with crystals embedded in an amorphous or glassy matrix;
* hypohyaline rocks are partially glassy;
* holohyaline rocks (such as [[obsidian]]) are completely glassy.

      <comment>/* Viscoelastic stress–strain phase-lag */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2721">'''Dynamic modulus''' is the ratio of stress to strain under ''vibratory conditions'' (calculated from data obtained from either free or forced vibration tests, in shear, compression, or elongation).  It is a property of [[viscoelastic]] materials.

== Viscoelastic stress–strain phase-lag ==

Viscoelasticity is studied using [[dynamic mechanical analysis]] where an oscillatory force (stress) is applied to a material and the resulting displacement (strain) is measured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://las.perkinelmer.com/content/ApplicationNotes/APP_FilmsandCoatings.pdf PerkinElmer &quot;Mechanical Properties of Films and Coatings&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In purely [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] materials the stress and strain occur in [[Phase (waves)|phase]], so that the response of one occurs simultaneously with the other.
*In purely [[viscosity|viscous]] materials, there is a [[Phase (waves)#Phase difference|phase difference]] between stress and strain, where strain lags stress by a 90 degree (&lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; [[radian]]) phase lag.
*Viscoelastic materials exhibit behavior somewhere in between that of purely viscous and purely elastic materials, exhibiting some phase lag in strain.&lt;ref name=Meyers&gt;Meyers and Chawla (1999): &quot;Mechanical Behavior of Materials,&quot; 98-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress and strain in a viscoelastic material can be represented using the following expressions:
*Strain: &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \varepsilon_0 \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;
*Stress: &lt;math&gt; \sigma = \sigma_0 \sin(\omega t+ \delta) \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt; \omega =2 \pi f &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is frequency of strain oscillation,
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time,
:&lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is phase lag between stress and strain.

=== Storage and loss modulus ===

The storage and loss modulus in viscoelastic materials measure the stored energy, representing the elastic portion, and the energy dissipated as heat, representing the viscous portion.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt; The tensile storage and loss moduli are defined as follows:
*Storage:  &lt;math&gt; E' = \frac {\sigma_0} {\varepsilon_0} \cos \delta &lt;/math&gt;



*Loss: &lt;math&gt; E'' =  \frac {\sigma_0} {\varepsilon_0} \sin \delta &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;


Similarly we also define shear storage and shear loss moduli, &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G''&lt;/math&gt;.

Complex variables can be used to express the moduli &lt;math&gt;E^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^*&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;E^* = E' + iE'' \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G^* = G' + iG'' \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the  [[imaginary unit]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12641">'''Equivalent dose''' is a [[Dose (radiation)|dose]] quantity used in the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) system of [[radiation protection|radiological protection]].

It represents the [[stochastic]] health effects (probability of cancer induction and genetic damage), of low levels of [[ionizing radiation]] on the human body. It is derived from the physical quantity [[absorbed dose]], but also takes into account the biological effectiveness of the radiation, which is dependent on the radiation type and energy.

==Application==
[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External dose quantities used in radiation protection and dosimetry]]
To enable consideration of stochastic health risk, calculations are performed to convert the physical quantity absorbed dose into equivalent dose, the details of which depend on the radiation type. For applications in [[radiation protection]] and [[dosimetry]] assessment the ICRP and the [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) have published recommendations and data on how to calculate equivalent dose from absorbed dose.

Equivalent dose is designated by the ICRP as a &quot;limiting quantity&quot;; to specify exposure limits to ensure that &quot;the occurrence of stochastic health effects is kept below unacceptable levels and that tissue reactions are avoided&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In 1991, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [7] recommended a revised system of dose limitation, including specification of primary ''limiting quantities'' for radiation protection purposes. These protection quantities are essentially unmeasurable&quot; - IAEA Safety report 16&lt;/ref&gt; This is a calculated value, as equivalent dose cannot be practically measured, and the purpose of the calculation is to generate a value of equivalent dose for comparison with observed health effects.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph B64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==
[[File:SI Radiation dose units.png|400px|thumb|right|Relationships of SI external &quot;protection&quot; dose quantities]]
Equivalent dose ''H''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated using the mean [[absorbed dose]] deposited in body tissue or organ T, multiplied by the radiation weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; which is dependent on the type and energy of the radiation R.

The radiation weighting factor represents the [[relative biological effectiveness]] of the radiation and modifies the absorbed dose to take account of the different biological effects of various types and [[Electronvolt|energies]] of radiation.

The ICRP has assigned radiation weighting factors to specified radiation types dependent on their [[relative biological effectiveness]], which are shown in accompanying table.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, glossary&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating equivalent dose from absorbed dose;

:&lt;math&gt;H_T = \sum_R W_R \cdot D_{T,R}\ &lt;/math&gt;
where,

:''H&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the equivalent dose absorbed by tissue T
:''D&lt;sub&gt;T,R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the absorbed dose in tissue T by radiation type R
:''W&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the radiation weighting factor defined by regulation
Thus for example, an absorbed dose of 1 Gy by alpha particles will lead to an equivalent dose of 20 Sv, and an equivalent dose of radiation is estimated to have the same biological effect as an equal amount of absorbed dose of gamma rays, which is given a weighting factor of 1.

To obtain the equivalent dose for a mix of radiation types and energies, a sum is taken over all types of radiation energy doses.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRP103&quot; /&gt; This takes into account the contributions of the varying biological effect of different radiation types.

==History==
The concept of equivalent dose was developed in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=R.H.|author2=J. Valentin|title=The History of ICRP and the  Evolution of its Policies|journal=Annals of the ICRP|year=2009|volume=39|series=ICRP Publication 109|issue=1|pages=pp. 75–110|doi=10.1016/j.icrp.2009.07.009|url=http://www.icrp.org/docs/The%20History%20of%20ICRP%20and%20the%20Evolution%20of%20its%20Policies.pdf|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1990 recommendations, the [[ICRP]] revised the definitions of some radiation protection quantities, and provided new names for the revised quantities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRP60&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=1990 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection|journal=Annals of the ICRP|year=1991|volume=21|series=ICRP publication 60|issue=1-3|url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%2060|accessdate=17 May 2012|isbn=978-0-08-041144-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regulators, notably the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) and the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] continue to use the old terminology of quality factors and dose equivalent, even though the underlying calculations have changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC1004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1004|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1004.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units==
The [[SI unit]] of measure for equivalent dose is the [[sievert]], defined as one [[Joule]] per [[kg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the [[roentgen equivalent man]] (rem), equal to 0.01 sievert, is still in common use, although regulatory and advisory bodies are encouraging transition to sieverts.&lt;ref name='nrc_definitions'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part034/part034-0003.html |title=NRC Regulations: §34.3 Definitions |accessdate=2007-03-14 |last=Nuclear Regulatory Commission |publisher=United States Government }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related quantities==
===Limitation of equivalent dose calculation===
Equivalent dose ''H''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is used for assessing stochastic health risk due to external radiation fields that ''penetrate uniformly'' through the ''whole body''. However it needs further corrections when the field is applied only to part(s) of the body, or non-uniformly to measure the overall stochastic health risk to the body. To enable this a further dose quantity called [[Effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] must be used to take into account the varying sensitivity of different organs and tissues to radiation.

===Relationship to committed dose===
Whilst equivalent dose is used for the stochastic effects of external radiation, a similar approach is used for internal, or [[committed dose]]. The ICRP defines an equivalent dose quantity for individual committed dose, which is used to measure the effect of inhaled or ingested radioactive materials. A committed dose from an internal source represents the same effective risk as the same amount of equivalent dose applied uniformly to the whole body from an external source.

'''Committed equivalent dose''', H &lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') is the time integral of the equivalent dose rate in a particular tissue or organ that will be received by an individual following intake of radioactive material into the body by a Reference Person, where s is the integration time in years.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Glossary.&lt;/ref&gt;
This refers specifically to the dose in a specific tissue or organ, in the similar way to external equivalent dose.

The ICRP states &quot;Radionuclides incorporated in the human body irradiate the tissues over time periods determined by their physical half-life and their biological retention within the body. Thus they may give rise to doses to body tissues for many months or years after the intake. The need to regulate exposures to radionuclides and the accumulation of radiation dose over extended periods of time has led to the definition of committed dose quantities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP Publication 103 paragraph 140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equivalent dose V dose equivalent===
There can be confusion between ''equivalent dose'' and ''dose equivalent''.  Although the CIPM definition states that the linear energy transfer function of the ICRU is used in calculating the biological effect, the ICRP in 1990 &lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 60 published in 1991&lt;/ref&gt; developed the &quot;protection&quot; dose quantities named ''effective'' and ''equivalent'' dose, which are calculated from more complex computational models and are distinguished by not having the phrase ''dose equivalent'' in their name.

Prior to 1990, the ICRP used the term &quot;dose equivalent&quot; to refer to the absorbed dose at a point multiplied by the quality factor at that point, where the quality factor was a function of [[linear energy transfer]] (LET). Currently, the ICRP's definition of &quot;equivalent dose&quot; represents an average dose over an organ or tissue, and radiation weighting factors are used instead of quality factors.

The phrase ''dose equivalent'' is only used for operational quantities which use Q for calculation, and the following are defined as such by the ICRU and ICRP:

* ambient dose equivalent
* directional dose equivalent
* personal dose equivalent

In the US there are further differently named dose quantities which are not part of the ICRP system of quantities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmsym.org/archives/2009/pdfs/9444.pdf - &quot;The confusing world of radiation dosimetry&quot;] - M.A. Boyd, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009. An account of chronological differences between US and ICRP dosimetry systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of old factors===
[[File:Neutron radiation weighting factor as a function of kinetic energy.gif|thumb|350px|The radiation weighting factor for neutrons has been revised over time, and is different for US NRC, and ICRP.]]
The [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) and the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] continue to use the old terminology of quality factors and dose equivalent. The NRC quality factors are independent of linear energy transfer, though not always equal to the ICRP radiation weighting factors.&lt;ref name=NRC1004 /&gt; The NRC's definition of dose equivalent is &quot;the product of the absorbed dose in tissue, quality factor, and all other necessary modifying factors at the location of interest.&quot; However, it is apparent from their definition of effective dose equivalent that &quot;all other necessary modifying factors&quot; excludes the tissue weighting factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1003|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1003.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The radiation weighting factors for neutrons are also different between US NRC and the ICRP - see accompanying diagram.

===Dosimetry reports===
Cumulative equivalent dose due to external whole-body exposure is normally reported to nuclear energy workers in regular [[dosimetry]] reports.

In the US, three different equivalent doses are typically reported: 
*[[deep-dose equivalent]], (DDE)
* shallow dose equivalent, (SDE)
* eye dose equivalent

147&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as ''diffusive shock acceleration'' (a subclass of Fermi acceleration &lt;ref name=&quot;Fermi49&quot;&gt;On the Origin of the Cosmic Radiation, E. Fermi, Physical Review 75, pp. 1169-1174, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;), is the [[acceleration]] that [[charge (physics)|charged]] [[Subatomic particle|particles]] undergo when being repeatedly reflected, usually by a [[magnetic mirror]] (see also [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]).  This is thought to be the primary mechanism by which particles gain non thermal energies in astrophysical [[shock waves]]. It plays a very important role in many astrophysical models, mainly of shocks including [[solar flares]] and [[supernova remnant]]s.

There are two types of Fermi acceleration: first-order Fermi acceleration (in shocks) and second-order Fermi acceleration (in the environment of moving magnetized gas clouds). In both cases the environment has to be collisionless in order for the mechanism to be effective. This is because Fermi acceleration only applies to particles with energies exceeding the thermal energies, and frequent collisions with surrounding particles will cause severe energy loss and as a result no acceleration will occur.

==First order Fermi acceleration==
Shock waves typically have moving magnetic inhomogeneities both preceding and following them.  Consider the case of a charged particle traveling through the shock wave (from upstream to downstream).  If it encounters a moving change in the magnetic field, this can reflect it back through the shock (downstream to upstream) at increased velocity.  If a similar process occurs upstream, the particle will again gain energy.  These multiple reflections greatly increase its energy. The resulting energy spectrum of many particles undergoing this process (assuming that they do not influence the structure of the shock) turns out to be a power law:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN(\epsilon)}{d\epsilon}\propto \epsilon ^{-p}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
where the spectral index &lt;math&gt;p\gtrsim2&lt;/math&gt; depends, for non-relativistic shocks, only on the compression ratio of the shock. &lt;br /&gt;
The term &quot;First order&quot; comes from the fact that the energy gain per shock crossing is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\beta_s&lt;/math&gt;, the velocity of the shock divided by the speed of light.

===The injection problem===
A mystery of first order Fermi processes is the ''injection problem''. In the environment of a shock, only particles with energies that exceed the thermal energy by much (a factor of a few at least) can cross the shock and 'enter the game' of acceleration. It is presently unclear what mechanism causes the particles to initially have energies sufficiently high to do so.&lt;ref&gt;

Section 7.4 &quot;The Injection Problem&quot;.
p. 362.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second order Fermi acceleration==
Second order Fermi Acceleration relates to the amount of energy gained during the motion of a charged particle in the presence of randomly moving &quot;magnetic mirrors&quot;. So, if the magnetic mirror is moving towards the particle, the particle will end up with increased energy upon reflection. The opposite holds if the mirror is receding. This notion was used by Fermi (1949)&lt;ref name=&quot;Fermi49&quot;/&gt; to explain the mode of formation of cosmic rays. In this case the magnetic mirror is a moving interstellar magnetized cloud. In a random motion environment, Fermi argued, the probability of a head-on collision is greater than a head-tail collision, so particles would, on average, be accelerated. This random process is now called second-order Fermi acceleration, because the mean energy gain per bounce depends on the mirror velocity squared, &lt;math&gt;\beta_m^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Surprisingly, the resulting energy spectrum anticipated from this physical setup is very similar to the one found for first order Fermi acceleration.

Increasing the size of the contact area on the ground (the ''footprint'') in relation to the weight decreases the ground pressure.  Ground pressure of 14&amp;nbsp;kPa (2&amp;nbsp;psi) or less is recommended for fragile ecosystems like marshes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/initiatives/media/bmp.pdf|title=Page 4 of Management of small dock and piers, best management practices, May 2005 NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Decreasing the ground pressure increases the flotation, allowing easier passage of the body over soft terrain. This is often observed in activities like [[snowshoe]]ing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3782">The '''heat capacity rate''' is [[heat]] transfer [[terminology]] used in [[thermodynamics]] and different forms of engineering denoting the quantity of heat a flowing [[fluid]] of a certain mass flow rate is able to absorb or release per unit [[temperature]] change per unit time. It is typically denoted as C, listed from empirical data experimentally determined in various reference works, and is typically stated as a comparison between a hot and a cold fluid, C&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; either graphically, or as a [[linear equation|linearized equation]]. It is an important quantity in [[heat exchanger]] [[technology]] common to either heating or cooling systems and needs, and the solution of many real world problems such as the design of disparate items as different as a [[microprocessor]] and an internal [[combustion]] [[heat engine|engine]].

==Basis==
A hot fluid's heat capacity rate can be much greater than, equal to, or much less than the heat capacity rate of the same fluid when cold. In practice, it is most important in specifying heat-exchanger systems, wherein one fluid usually of dissimilar nature is used to cool another fluid such as the hot gases or steam cooled in a [[power plant]] by a [[heat sink]] from a water source&amp;mdash;a case of dissimilar fluids, or for specifying the minimal cooling needs of heat transfer across boundaries, such as in air cooling.

As the ability of a fluid to resist change in temperature itself changes as heat transfer occurs changing its net average instantaneous temperature, it is a quantity of interest in designs which have to compensate for the fact that it varies continuously in a dynamic system. While itself varying, such change must be taken into account when designing a system for overall behavior to stimuli or likely [[Natural environment|environmental conditions]], and in particular the worst-case conditions encountered under the high stresses imposed near the limits of operability&amp;mdash; for example, an air-cooled engine in a desert climate on a very hot day.

If the hot fluid had a much larger heat capacity rate, then when hot and cold fluids went through a heat exchanger, the hot fluid would have a very small change in temperature while the cold fluid would heat up a significant amount. If the cool fluid has a much lower heat capacity rate, that is desirable. If they were equal, they would both change more or less temperature equally, assuming equal mass-flow per unit time through a heat exchanger. In practice, a cooling fluid which has both a higher [[specific heat]] capacity and a lower heat capacity rate is desirable, accounting for the pervasiveness of water cooling solutions in technology&amp;mdash;the polar nature of the water molecule creates some distinct sub-atomic behaviors favorable in practice.

&lt;math&gt;C=c_p\frac{dm}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''C''''' = heat capacity rate of the fluid of interest,&lt;br&gt;
'''''dm/dt''''' = mass flow rate of the fluid of interest and&lt;br&gt;
'''''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = [[specific heat]] of the fluid of interest.

\sigma_{red}=\sqrt{({\sigma}^2) + 3({\tau}^2)}

Very useful in calculating the span width of the bridges like [[Golden Gate Bridge]] or [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]], their beam cross-sections, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2914">The '''critical relative humidity''' (CRH) of a salt is defined as the [[relative humidity]] of the surrounding atmosphere (at a certain temperature) at which the material begins to absorb moisture from the atmosphere and below which it will not absorb atmospheric moisture.

When the humidity of the atmosphere is equal to (or is greater than) the critical relative humidity of a sample of salt, the sample will take up water until all of the salt is dissolved to yield a saturated solution. All water-soluble salts and mixtures have characteristic critical humidities; it is a unique material property.

The critical relative humidity of most salts decreases with increasing temperature. For instance, the critical relative humidity of ammonium nitrate decreases 22% with a temperature from 0°C to 40°C (32°F to 104°F).

The critical relative humidity of several fertilizer salts is given in table 1:

{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;

'''Table 1: Critical relative humidities of pure salts at 30°C.'''

Mixtures of salts usually have lower critical humidities than either of the constituents. Fertilizers that contain Urea as an ingredient usually exhibit a much lower Critical Relative Humidity than Fertilizers without Urea.Table 2 shows CRH data for two-component mixtures:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|}

'''Table 2: Critical relative humidities of mixtures of salts at 30°C (values are percent relative humidity).'''

As shown, the effect of salt mixing is most dramatic in the case of ammonium nitrate with urea. This mixture has an extremely low critical relative humidity and can therefore only be used in liquid fertilisers (so called [[UAN]]-solutions).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1659">In electrical engineering and acoustics, '''immittance''' is a concept combining the [[Electrical impedance|'''im'''pedance]] and [[admittance|ad'''mittance''']] of a system or circuit.

It is sometimes convenient to use ''immittance'' to refer to a [[complex number]] which may be either the impedance (ratio of [[volt]]age to [[Electric current|current]] in electrical circuits, or [[sound pressure]] to [[volume velocity]] in acoustical systems) or the admittance (ratio of current to voltage, or volume velocity to sound pressure) of a system. In [[audiology]], [[tympanometry]] is sometimes called ''immittance testing''.

Immittance does not have units since it applies to both impedance and admittance, which have different units. However, in certain theoretical work it may be necessary to deal with general functions, which afterward will be specialised to become either an impedance or an admittance by the assignment of suitable units; in such cases it is convenient to refer to the functions as immittances.

In electronics, the &quot;immittance&quot; [[Smith chart]] simply has both the impedance and admittance grids on the same chart, which is useful for cascading series-connected with parallel-connected electric circuits.

[[File:TransmissionLineDefinitions.svg|thumb|310px|A [[transmission line]] drawn as two black wires. At a distance ''x'' into the line, there is current [[phasor]] ''I(x)'' traveling through each wire, and there is a [[voltage difference]] phasor ''V(x)'' between the wires (bottom voltage minus top voltage). If &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; is the '''characteristic impedance''' of the line, then &lt;math&gt;V(x) / I(x) = Z_0&lt;/math&gt; for a wave moving rightward, or &lt;math&gt;V(x)/I(x) = -Z_0&lt;/math&gt; for a wave moving leftward.]]
[[File:Transmission line schematic.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] where a source is coupled to a [[electrical load|load]] with a [[transmission line]] having characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The '''characteristic impedance''' or '''surge impedance''' (usually written Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) of a uniform [[transmission line]] is the ratio of the amplitudes of voltage and current of a single wave propagating along the line; that is, a wave travelling in one direction in the absence of [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|reflections]] in the other direction. Characteristic impedance is determined by the geometry and materials of the transmission line and, for a uniform line, is not dependent on its length. The [[SI]] unit of characteristic [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is the [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]].

The characteristic impedance of a lossless transmission line is purely real, with no [[Electrical reactance|reactive]] component.&lt;!-- See 'Lossless line' below for explanation. ---&gt; Energy supplied by a source at one end of such a line is transmitted through the line without being dissipated in the line itself. A transmission line of finite length (lossless or lossy) that is terminated at one end with an impedance equal to the characteristic impedance appears to the source like an infinitely long transmission line and produces no reflections.

== Transmission line model ==

[[File:Transmission line element.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of an elemental length of a transmission line.]]

The characteristic impedance of a transmission line is the ratio of the voltage and current of a wave travelling along the line.  When the wave reaches the end of the line, in general, there will be a reflected wave which travels back along the line in the opposite direction.  When this wave reaches the source, it adds to the transmitted wave and the ratio of the voltage and current at the input to the line will no longer be the characteristic impedance.  This new ratio is called the [[input impedance]].  The input impedance of an infinite line is equal to the characteristic impedance since the transmitted wave is never reflected back from the end.  It can be shown that an equivalent definition is: the characteristic impedance of a line is that impedance which when terminating an arbitrary length of line at its output will produce an input impedance equal to the characteristic impedance.  This is so because there is no reflection on a line terminated in its own characteristic impedance.

Applying the transmission line model based on the [[telegrapher's equations]], the general expression for the characteristic impedance of a transmission line is:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0=\sqrt{\frac{R+j\omega L}{G+j\omega C}}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] per unit length, considering the two conductors to be [[in series]],
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[inductance]] per unit length,
:&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] of the dielectric per unit length,
:&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the [[capacitance]] per unit length,
:&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]], and
:&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]].

Although an infinite line is assumed, since all quantities are per unit length, the characteristic impedance is independent of the length of the transmission line.

The voltage and current [[Phasor (electronics)|phasor]]s on the line are related by the characteristic impedance as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V^+}{I^+} = Z_0 = -\frac{V^-}{I^-}&lt;/math&gt;
where the superscripts &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; represent forward- and backward-traveling waves, respectively.  A surge of energy on a finite transmission line will see an impedance of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; prior to any reflections arriving, hence ''surge impedance'' is an alternative name for characteristic impedance.

==Lossless line==
The analysis of lossless lines provides an accurate approximation for real transmission lines that simplifies the mathematics considered in modeling transmission lines. A lossless line is defined as a transmission line that has no line resistance. This would imply that the line has infinite conductivity and acts like a perfect conductor. For a lossless line, ''R'' and ''G'' are both zero, so the equation for characteristic impedance derived above reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

The above expression is wholly real, since the imaginary term ''j'' has canceled out, implying that ''Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is purely resistive. For a lossless line terminated in ''Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', there is no loss of current across the line, and so the voltage remains the same along the line. The lossless line model is a useful approximation for many practical cases, such as low-loss transmission lines and transmission lines with high frequency. For both of these cases, R and G are much smaller than ωL and ωC, respectively, and can thus be ignored.

== Surge impedance loading ==

In [[electric power transmission]], the characteristic impedance of a transmission line is expressed in terms of the '''surge impedance loading''' ('''SIL'''), or natural loading, being the power loading at which [[reactive power]] is neither produced nor absorbed:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{SIL}=\frac{{V_\mathrm{LL}}^2}{Z_0}&lt;/math&gt;
in which &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{LL}&lt;/math&gt; is the line-to-line [[voltage]] in [[volts]].

Loaded below its SIL, a line supplies reactive power to the system, tending to raise system voltages. Above it, the line absorbs reactive power, tending to depress the voltage. The [[Ferranti effect]] describes the voltage gain towards the remote end of a very lightly loaded (or open ended) transmission line. Underground [[cable]]s normally have a very low characteristic impedance, resulting in an SIL that is typically in excess of the thermal limit of the cable. Hence a cable is almost always a source of reactive power.

In [[electromagnetism]] and [[electronics]], '''inductance''' is the property of an [[electrical conductor]] by which a change in [[electric Current|current]] flowing through it induces an [[electromotive force]] in both the conductor itself&lt;ref name=&quot;Sears and Zemansky 1964:743&quot;&gt;Sears and Zemansky 1964:743&lt;/ref&gt; and in any nearby conductors by mutual inductance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sears and Zemansky 1964:743&quot;/&gt;

These effects are derived from two fundamental observations of physics: a steady current creates a steady magnetic field described by [[Oersted's law]],&lt;ref&gt;Sears and Zemansksy 1964:671&lt;/ref&gt; and a time-varying magnetic field induces an electromotive force in nearby conductors, which is described by [[Faraday's law of induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Sears and Zemansky 1964:671 -- &quot;The work of Oersted thus demonstrated that magnetic effects could be produced by moving electric charges, and that of Faraday and Henry that currents could be produced by moving magnets.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lenz's law]],&lt;ref&gt;Sears and Zemansky 1964:731 -- &quot;The direction of an induced current is such as to oppose the cause producing it&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; a changing electric current through a circuit that contains inductance induces a proportional voltage, which opposes the change in current (self-inductance). The varying field in this circuit may also induce an e.m.f. in neighbouring circuits (mutual inductance).

The term ''inductance'' was coined by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Heaviside| first = Oliver| title = Electrical Papers| url = http://books.google.com/?id=bywPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA271| year = 1894| publisher = Macmillan and Company| isbn = | page = 271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is customary to use the symbol ''L'' for inductance, in honour of the physicist [[Heinrich Lenz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the [[International System of Units|SI]] system, the measurement unit for inductance is the [[henry (unit)|henry]] with the unit symbol ''H'', named in honor of [[Joseph Henry]], who discovered inductance independently of, but not before, Faraday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Electromagnetism|url=http://web.hep.uiuc.edu/home/serrede/P435/Lecture_Notes/A_Brief_History_of_Electromagnetism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circuit analysis==
An [[electronic component]] that is intended to add inductance to a circuit is called an [[inductor]]. Inductors are typically manufactured from coils of wire. This design delivers two desired properties, a concentration of the magnetic field into a small physical space and a linking of the magnetic field into the circuit multiple times.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

The relationship between the self-inductance ''L'' of an electrical circuit, the voltage ''v(t)'', and the current ''i(t)'' through the circuit is
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle v(t)= L\frac{di}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.
A voltage is induced across an inductor ([[back EMF]]), that is equal to the product of the inductor's inductance and the rate of change of current through the inductor.

All circuits have, in practice, some inductance, which may have beneficial or detrimental effects. For a [[tuned circuit]], inductance is used to provide a frequency-selective circuit. Practical inductors may be used to provide filtering, or energy storage, in a given network. The inductance per unit length of a [[transmission line]] is one of the properties that determines its [[characteristic impedance]]; balancing the inductance and capacitance of cables is important for distortion-free [[telegraphy]] and [[telephony]]. The inductance of long AC power transmission lines effects the power capacity of the line. Sensitive circuits, such as [[microphone]] and [[computer network]] cables, may utilize special cabling construction, limiting the [[inductive coupling]] between circuits.

The generalization to the case of ''K'' electrical circuits with currents ''i&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' and voltages ''v&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' reads
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle v_{m}=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{K}L_{m,n}\frac{di_{n}}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, inductance ''L'' is a symmetric matrix. The diagonal coefficients ''L&lt;sub&gt;m,m&lt;/sub&gt;'' are called coefficients of self-inductance, the off-diagonal elements are called coefficients of mutual inductance. The coefficients of inductance are constant, as long as no magnetizable material with nonlinear characteristics is involved. This is a direct consequence of the linearity of [[Maxwell's equations]] in the fields and the current density. The coefficients of inductance become functions of the currents in the [[#Nonlinear inductance|nonlinear case]].

==Derivation from Faraday's law of inductance==
The inductance equations above are a consequence of [[Maxwell's equations]]. There is a straightforward derivation in the important case of electrical circuits consisting of thin wires.

In a system of ''K'' wire loops, each with one or several wire turns, the [[flux linkage]] of loop ''m'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle N_{m}\Phi _{m}=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{K}L_{m,n}i_{n}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here ''N&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the number of turns in loop ''m'', Φ''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' the [[magnetic flux]] through this loop, and ''L&lt;sub&gt;m,n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are some constants. This equation follows from [[Ampere's law]] - magnetic fields and fluxes are linear functions of the currents. By [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] of induction, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle v_{m}=N_{m}\frac{d\Phi _{m}}{dt}=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{K}L_{m,n}\frac{di_{n}}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the voltage induced in circuit ''m''. This agrees with the definition of inductance above if the coefficients ''L&lt;sub&gt;m,n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are identified with the coefficients of inductance. Because the total currents ''N&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' contribute to Φ''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' it also follows that ''L&lt;sub&gt;m,n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is proportional to the product of turns ''N&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Inductance and magnetic field energy==
Multiplying the equation for ''v&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' above with ''i&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;dt'' and summing over ''m'' gives the energy transferred to the system in the time interval ''dt'',
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle
\sum\limits_{m}^{K}i_{m}v_{m}dt=\sum\limits_{m,n=1}^{K}i_{m}L_{m,n}di_{n}
\overset{!}{=}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{K}\frac{\partial W\left( i\right) }{\partial i_{n}}di_{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

This must agree with the change of the magnetic field energy ''W'' caused by the currents.&lt;ref&gt;The kinetic energy of the drifting electrons is many orders of magnitude smaller than W, except for nanowires.&lt;/ref&gt; The integrability condition
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{\partial ^{2}W}{\partial i_{m}\partial i_{n}}=\frac{\partial ^{2}W}{\partial i_{n}\partial i_{m}}&lt;/math&gt;
requires ''L&lt;sub&gt;m,n&lt;/sub&gt;=L&lt;sub&gt;n,m&lt;/sub&gt;''. The inductance matrix ''L&lt;sub&gt;m,n&lt;/sub&gt;'' thus is symmetric. The integral of the energy transfer is the magnetic field energy as a function of the currents,
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle W\left( i\right) =\tfrac{1}{2}\sum \limits_{m,n=1}^{K}i_{m}L_{m,n}i_{n}.&lt;/math&gt;
This equation also is a direct consequence of the linearity of Maxwell's equations. It is helpful to associate changing electric currents with a build-up or decrease of magnetic field energy. The corresponding energy transfer requires or generates a voltage. A mechanical analogy in the ''K''=1 case with magnetic field energy (1/2)''Li''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a body with mass ''M'', velocity ''u'' and kinetic energy (1/2)''Mu''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The rate of change of velocity (current) multiplied with mass (inductance) requires or generates a force (an electrical voltage).

==Coupled inductors and mutual inductance==
{{Further|Coupling (electronics)}}

[[Image:Mutually inducting inductors.PNG|thumb|300px|right|The circuit diagram representation of mutually coupled inductors.

The two vertical lines between the inductors indicate a ''solid core'' that the wires of the inductor are wrapped around. &quot;n:m&quot; shows the ratio between the number of windings of the left inductor to windings of the right inductor. This picture also shows the [[dot convention]].]]

'''Mutual inductance''' occurs when the change in current in one inductor induces a voltage in another nearby inductor. It is important as the mechanism by which [[transformer]]s work, but it can also cause unwanted coupling between conductors in a circuit.

The mutual inductance, ''M'', is also a measure of the coupling between two inductors. The mutual inductance by circuit ''i'' on circuit ''j'' is given by the double integral ''[[Franz Ernst Neumann|Neumann]] formula'', see [[#Calculation techniques|calculation techniques]]

The mutual inductance also has the relationship:
:&lt;math&gt;M_{21} = N_1 N_2 P_{21} \!&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;M_{21}&lt;/math&gt; is the mutual inductance, and the subscript specifies the relationship of the voltage induced in coil 2 due to the current in coil 1.
:''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns in coil 1,
:''N''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns in coil 2,
:''P''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[permeance]] of the space occupied by the flux.

The mutual inductance also has a relationship with the coupling coefficient. The coupling coefficient is always between 1 and 0, and is a convenient way to specify the relationship between a certain orientation of inductors with arbitrary inductance:

:&lt;math&gt;M = k \sqrt{L_1 L_2} \! &lt;/math&gt;
where
:''k'' is the ''coupling coefficient'' and 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;1,
:''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the inductance of the first coil, and
:''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the inductance of the second coil.

Once the mutual inductance, ''M'', is determined from this factor, it can be used to predict the behavior of a circuit:
:&lt;math&gt; v_1 = L_1 \frac{di_1}{dt} - M \frac{di_2}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;
where
:''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage across the inductor of interest,
:''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the inductance of the inductor of interest,
:d''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t'' is the derivative, with respect to time, of the current through the inductor of interest,
:d''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t'' is the derivative, with respect to time, of the current through the inductor that is coupled to the first inductor, and
:''M'' is the mutual inductance.

The minus sign arises because of the sense the current ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been defined in the diagram. With both currents defined going into the dots the sign of M will be positive (the equation would read with a plus sign instead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mahmood Nahvi, Joseph Edminister|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nrxT9Qjguk8C&amp;pg=PA338|title= Schaum's outline of theory and problems of electric circuits|page=338|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2002|isbn=0-07-139307-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matrix representation===
The circuit can be described by any of the [[two-port network]] parameter matrix representations. The most direct are the [[z parameters]], which are given by

:&lt;math&gt; [\mathbf z] = s \begin{bmatrix} L_1 \ M \\ M \ L_2 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the [[complex frequency]] variable.

===Equivalent circuit===
[[File:Mutual inductance equivalent circuit.svg|thumb|Equivalent circuit of mutually coupled inductors]]
Mutually coupled inductors can equivalently be represented by a T-circuit of inductors as shown. If the coupling is strong and the inductors are of unequal values then the series inductor on the step-down side may take on a negative value.

This can be analyzed as a two port network. With the output terminated with some arbitrary impedance, ''Z'', the voltage gain, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; A_\mathrm v = \frac {sMZ}{s^2 L_1 L_2 - s^2 M^2 + sL_1 Z} &lt;/math&gt;

For tightly coupled inductors where {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1}} this reduces to

:&lt;math&gt; A_\mathrm v = \sqrt {L_2 \over L_1} &lt;/math&gt;

which is independent of the load impedance. If the inductors are wound on the same core and with the same geometry, then this expression is equal to the turns ratio of the two inductors because inductance is proportional to the square of turns ratio.

The input impedance of the network is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; Z_\mathrm {in} = \frac {s^2 L_1 L_2 -s^2 M^2 + s L_1 Z}{sL_2 + Z}&lt;/math&gt;

For {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1}} this reduces to

:&lt;math&gt; Z_\mathrm {in} = \frac {s L_1 Z}{sL_2 + Z} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the current gain, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is ''not'' independent of load unless the further condition

:&lt;math&gt; |sL_2| \gg |Z| &lt;/math&gt;

is met, in which case,

:&lt;math&gt; Z_\mathrm {in} \approx {L_1 \over L_2} Z &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; A_\mathrm i \approx \sqrt {L_1 \over L_2} = {1 \over A_\mathrm v} &lt;/math&gt;

===Tuned transformer===

When either side of the transformer is a [[tuned circuit]], the amount of mutual inductance between the two windings, together with the [[Q factor]] of the circuit, determine the shape of the frequency response curve. The tuned circuit together with the transformer load form an [[RLC circuit]] with a definite peak in the frequency response. When both sides of the transformer are tuned, it is described as [[double-tuned amplifier|double-tuned]]. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of ''k''. When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through mutual inductance, the bandwidth will be narrow. As the amount of mutual inductance increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the mutual inductance is increased beyond a critical point, the peak in the response curve begins to drop, and the center frequency will be attenuated more strongly than its direct sidebands. This is known as overcoupling.

===Ideal Transformers===
When ''k'' = 1, the inductor is referred to as being closely coupled. If in addition, the self-inductances go to infinity, the inductor becomes an ideal [[transformer]]. In this case the voltages, currents, and number of turns can be related in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{s} = \frac{N_\text{s}}{N_\text{p}} V_\text{p} &lt;/math&gt;
where
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage across the secondary inductor,
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage across the primary inductor (the one connected to a power source),
:''N''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns in the secondary inductor, and
:''N''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns in the primary inductor.

Conversely the current:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{s} = \frac{N_\text{p}}{N_\text{s}} I_\text{p} &lt;/math&gt;
where
:''I''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the current through the secondary inductor,
:''I''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the current through the primary inductor (the one connected to a power source),
:''N''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns in the secondary inductor, and
:''N''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns in the primary inductor.

Note that the power through one inductor is the same as the power through the other. Also note that these equations don't work if both inductors are forced (with power sources).

==Calculation techniques==
In the most general case, inductance can be calculated from Maxwell's equations. Many important cases can be solved using simplifications. Where high frequency currents are considered, with [[skin effect]], the surface current densities and magnetic field may be obtained by solving the Laplace equation. Where the conductors are thin wires, self-inductance still depends on the wire radius and the distribution of the current in the wire. This current distribution is approximately constant (on the surface or in the volume of the wire) for a wire radius much smaller than other length scales.

===Mutual inductance of two wire loops===

The mutual inductance by a filamentary circuit ''m'' on a filamentary circuit ''n'' is given by the double integral ''[[Franz Ernst Neumann|Neumann]] formula''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Allgemeine Gesetze der inducirten elektrischen Ströme | journal = Abhandlungen der Königlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, aus dem Jahre 1845 | year = 1847 | first = F. E. | last = Neumann | pages = 1–87| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; L_{m,n} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \oint_{C_m}\oint_{C_n} \frac{\mathbf{dx}_m\cdot\mathbf{dx}_n}{|\mathbf{x}_m - \mathbf{x}_n|} &lt;/math&gt;
The symbol μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[magnetic constant]] ({{nowrap|4{{pi}} &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;7&lt;/sup&gt; H/m}}), ''C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the curves spanned by the wires. See a [[Derivation of self inductance|derivation of this equation]].

===Self-inductance of a wire loop===
Formally, the self-inductance of a wire loop would be given by the above equation with ''m'' = ''n''. The problem, however, is that ''1/|'''x'''-'''x''''|'' now becomes infinite, making it necessary to take the finite wire radius ''a'' and the distribution of the current in the wire into account. There remain the contribution from the integral over all points with ''|'''x'''-'''x''''|'' &gt; ''a''/2 and a correction term,&lt;ref name=&quot;den12&quot;&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Dengler |first=R. |eprint=1204.1486 |title=Self inductance of a wire loop as a curve integral|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L = \left (\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \oint_{C}\oint_{C'} \frac{\mathbf{dx}\cdot\mathbf{dx}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|}\right )_{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'| &gt; a/2} + \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}lY + O\left( \mu_0 a \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''a'' and ''l'' denote the radius and length of the wire, and ''Y'' is a constant that depends on the distribution of the current in the wire: ''Y'' = 0 when the current flows in the surface of the wire ([[skin effect]]), ''Y'' = 1/2 when the current is homogeneous across the wire. This approximation is accurate when the wires are long compared to their cross-sectional dimensions.

===Method of images===
In some cases, different current distributions generate the same magnetic field in some section of space. This fact may be used to relate self inductances ([[method of images]]). As an example, consider the two systems:
* A wire at distance ''d/2'' in front of a perfectly conducting wall (which is the return)
* Two parallel wires at distance ''d'', with opposite current

The magnetic field of the two systems coincides (in a half space). The magnetic field energy and the inductance of the second system thus are twice as large as that of the first system.

===Relation between inductance and capacitance===
Inductance per length L' and [[capacitance]] per length C' are related to each other in the special case of [[transmission lines]] consisting of two parallel perfect conductors of arbitrary but constant cross section,&lt;ref name=&quot;class_electro75&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=J. D. |title=Classical Electrodynamics|year=1975 |publisher=Wiley |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle L'C'={\varepsilon \mu}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ε and µ denote the dielectric constant and [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]] of the medium that the conductors are embedded in. There is no electric and no magnetic field inside the conductors (complete [[skin effect]], high frequency). Current flows down on one line and returns on the other. Signals will propagate along the transmission line at the speed of electromagnetic radiation in the non-conductive medium enveloping the conductors.

The symbol μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[magnetic constant]] (4&amp;pi;×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; H/m). For high frequencies, the electric current flows in the conductor surface
([[skin effect]]) and, depending on the geometry, it is sometimes necessary to distinguish
low and high frequency inductances. This is the purpose of the constant ''Y'':
''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 when the current is uniformly distributed over the surface of the wire (skin effect),
''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 when the current is uniformly distributed over the cross section of the wire. In the high frequency case, if conductors approach each other, an additional screening current flows in their surface, and expressions containing Y become invalid.

==Inductance with physical symmetry==

===Inductance of a solenoid===
A [[solenoid]] is a long, thin coil, i.e. a coil whose length is much greater than its diameter. Under these conditions, and without any magnetic material used, the [[Magnetic field|magnetic flux density]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; within the coil is practically constant and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle B = \mu_0 Ni/l&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic constant]], &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; the number of turns, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; the current and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; the length of the coil. Ignoring end effects, the total magnetic flux through the coil is obtained by multiplying the flux density &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; by the cross-section area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Phi = \mu_0 N i A/l,&lt;/math&gt;
When this is combined with the definition of inductance,
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle L = N \Phi/i&lt;/math&gt;
it follows that the inductance of a solenoid is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle L = \mu_0N^2A/l.&lt;/math&gt;

A table of inductance for short solenoids of various diameter to length ratios has been calculated by Dellinger, Whittmore, and Ould&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This, and the inductance of more complicated shapes, can be derived from [[Maxwell's equations]]. For rigid air-core coils, inductance is a function of coil geometry and number of turns, and is independent of current.

Similar analysis applies to a solenoid with a magnetic core, but only if the length of the coil is much greater than the product of the relative permeability of the magnetic core and the diameter. That limits the simple analysis to low-permeability cores, or extremely long thin solenoids. Although rarely useful, the equations are,
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle B = \mu_0\mu_r Ni/l&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu_r&lt;/math&gt; the relative permeability of the material within the solenoid,
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Phi = \mu_0\mu_rNiA/l,&lt;/math&gt;
from which it follows that the inductance of a solenoid is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle L = \mu_0\mu_rN^2A/l.&lt;/math&gt;
where N is squared because of the definition of inductance.

Note that, since the permeability of ferromagnetic materials changes with applied magnetic flux, the inductance of a coil with a ferromagnetic core will generally vary with current.

===Inductance of a coaxial line===
Let the inner conductor have radius &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; and [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt;, let the dielectric between the inner and outer conductor have permeability &lt;math&gt;\mu_d&lt;/math&gt;, and let the outer conductor have inner radius &lt;math&gt;r_{o1}&lt;/math&gt;, outer radius &lt;math&gt;r_{o2}&lt;/math&gt;, and permeability &lt;math&gt;\mu_o&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that a DC current &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; flows in opposite directions in the two conductors, with uniform current density. The magnetic field generated by these currents points in the azimuthal direction and is a function of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; it can be computed using [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;0 \leq r \leq r_i: B(r) = \frac{\mu_i I r}{2 \pi r_i^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_i \leq r \leq r_{o1}: B(r) = \frac{\mu_d I}{2 \pi r}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{o1} \leq r \leq r_{o2}: B(r) = \frac{\mu_o I}{2 \pi r} \left( \frac{r_{o2}^2 - r^2}{r_{o2}^2 - r_{o1}^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The flux per length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; in the region between the conductors can be computed by drawing a surface containing the axis:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi_d}{dl} = \int_{r_i}^{r_{o1}} B(r) dr = \frac{\mu_d I}{2 \pi} \ln\frac{r_{o1}}{r_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Inside the conductors, L can be computed by equating the energy stored in an inductor, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}LI^2&lt;/math&gt;, with the energy stored in the magnetic field:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}LI^2 = \int_V \frac{B^2}{2\mu} dV&lt;/math&gt;

For a cylindrical geometry with no &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; dependence, the energy per unit length is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}L'I^2 = \int_{r_1}^{r_2} \frac{B^2}{2\mu} 2 \pi r~dr&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; is the inductance per unit length. For the inner conductor, the integral on the right-hand-side is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu_i I^2}{16 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;; for the outer conductor it is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu_o I^2}{4 \pi} \left( \frac{r_{o2}^2}{r_{o2}^2 - r_{o1}^2} \right)^2 \ln\frac{r_{o2}}{r_{o1}} - \frac{\mu_o I^2}{8 \pi} \left( \frac{r_{o2}^2}{r_{o2}^2 - r_{o1}^2} \right) - \frac{\mu_o I^2}{16 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; and summing the terms for each region together gives a total inductance per unit length of:

:&lt;math&gt;L' = \frac{\mu_i}{8 \pi} + \frac{\mu_d}{2 \pi} \ln\frac{r_{o1}}{r_i} + \frac{\mu_o}{2 \pi} \left( \frac{r_{o2}^2}{r_{o2}^2 - r_{o1}^2} \right)^2 \ln\frac{r_{o2}}{r_{o1}} - \frac{\mu_o}{4 \pi} \left( \frac{r_{o2}^2}{r_{o2}^2 - r_{o1}^2} \right) - \frac{\mu_o}{8 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

However, for a typical coaxial line application, we are interested in passing (non-DC) signals at frequencies for which the resistive [[skin effect]] cannot be neglected. In most cases, the inner and outer conductor terms are negligible, in which case one may approximate

:&lt;math&gt;L' = \frac{dL}{dl} \approx \frac{\mu_d}{2 \pi} \ln\frac{r_{o1}}{r_i}&lt;/math&gt;

==Phasor circuit analysis and impedance==

If signals of current and voltage are sine, using [[Phasor (electronics)|phasors]], the equivalent [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of an inductance is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_L = V / I = j \omega L \, &lt;/math&gt;
where
: ''j'' is the [[imaginary unit]],
: ''L'' is the inductance,
: ''ω = 2πf'' is the [[angular frequency]],
: ''f'' is the [[frequency]] and
: ''ωL = X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the inductive [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]].

==Nonlinear inductance==
Many inductors make use of [[magnetic materials]]. These materials over a large enough range exhibit a nonlinear permeability with such effects as [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]]. In turn, the saturation makes the resulting inductance a function of the applied current. Faraday's Law still holds but inductance is ambiguous and is different whether you are calculating circuit parameters or magnetic fluxes.

The secant or large-signal inductance is used in flux calculations. It is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;L_s(i)\ \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \ \frac{N\Phi}{i} = \frac{\Lambda}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

The differential or small-signal inductance, on the other hand, is used in calculating voltage. It is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;L_d(i)\ \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \ \frac{d(N\Phi)}{di} = \frac{d\Lambda}{di}&lt;/math&gt;

The circuit voltage for a nonlinear inductor is obtained via the differential inductance as shown by Faraday's Law and the [[chain rule]] of calculus.

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = \frac{d\Lambda}{dt} = \frac{d\Lambda}{di}\frac{di}{dt} = L_d(i)\frac{di}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

There are similar definitions for nonlinear mutual inductances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4835">The '''ionic strength''' of a solution is a measure of the concentration of [[ion]]s in that solution. Ionic [[Chemical compound|compound]]s, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions. The total [[electrolyte]] concentration in solution will affect important properties such as the dissociation or the solubility of different [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]. One of the main characteristics of a solution with dissolved ions is the ionic strength.

==Quantifying ionic strength==
The '''ionic strength''', ''I'', of a solution is a function of the [[concentration]] of ''all'' [[ion]]s present in that [[solution]].

&lt;math&gt;I = \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}\sum_{{\rm i}=1}^{n} c_{\rm i}z_{\rm i}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[molarity|molar concentration]] of ion i (M, mol/L), ''z''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Electric charge|charge]] number of that ion, and the sum is taken over all ions in the solution. For a 1:1 [[electrolyte]] such as [[sodium chloride]], the ionic strength is equal to the concentration, but for [[Magnesium sulfate|MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] the ionic strength is four times higher. Generally [[multivalency|multivalent]] ions contribute strongly to the ionic strength.
===Calculation example===
For example the ionic strength of a mixed  0.050&amp;nbsp;M  in Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and   0.020&amp;nbsp;M  in KCl solution is:

:''I'' = 1/2 &amp;times; [(Concentration of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in M &amp;times; # of Sodium ions &amp;times; (Charge of Sodium)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (Concentration of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in M &amp;times; # of SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ions &amp;times; (Charge of SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (Concentration of KCl &amp;times; # of Potassium ions &amp;times; (Charge of Potassium)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (Concentration of KCl in M &amp;times; # of Chloride ions &amp;times; (Charge of Chloride)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)]

:''I'' = 1/2 &amp;times; [(0.050 M &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; (+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (0.050 M &amp;times; 1 &amp;times; (&amp;minus;2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (0.020 M &amp;times; 1 &amp;times; (+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (0.020 M &amp;times; 1 &amp;times; (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)] = 0.17 M

==Non-ideal solutions==
Because in non-[[ideal solution]]s volumes are no longer strictly additive it is often preferable to work with [[molality]] ''b'' (mol/kg{H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}) rather than molarity ''c'' (mol/L). In that case, ionic strength is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; I = \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}\sum_{{i}=1}^{n} b_{i}z_{i}^{2} &lt;/math&gt;

in which
:''i'' =  ion identification number
:''z'' =  charge of ion

==Importance==
The ionic strength plays a central role in the [[Debye–Hückel theory]] that describes the strong deviations from ideality typically encountered in ionic solutions. It is also important for the theory of [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]] and related [[electrokinetic phenomena]] and [[electroacoustic phenomena]] in [[DLVO theory|colloids]] and other [[heterogeneous]] systems. That is, the [[Debye length]], which is the inverse of the Debye parameter (''κ''), is inversely proportional to the square root of the ionic strength. Debye length is characteristic of the double layer thickness. Increasing the concentration or [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] of the counterions compresses the double layer and increases the electrical potential gradient.

Media of high ionic strength are used in [[Determination of equilibrium constants|stability constant determination]] in order to minimize changes, during a titration, in the activity quotient of solutes at lower concentrations. Natural waters such as seawater have a non-zero ionic strength due to the presence of dissolved salts which significantly affects their properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6070">In [[radiometry]] (measurement of electromagnetic radiation), '''irradiance''' is the [[radiant flux]] ([[power (physics)|power]]) ''received'' by a ''surface'' per unit area, and '''spectral irradiance''' is the irradiance of a ''surface'' per unit [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]], depending on whether the [[Spectral radiometric quantity|spectrum]] is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of irradiance is the [[watt]] per square metre ({{nobreak|W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), while that of spectral irradiance is the watt per square metre per [[hertz]] (W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) or the watt per square metre per metre (W·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;)—commonly the watt per square metre per nanometre ({{nobreak|W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·nm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}). The [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS unit]] [[erg]] per square centimetre per second ({{nobreak|erg·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is often used in [[astronomy]]. Irradiance is often called &quot;intensity&quot; in branches of physics other than radiometry, but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with [[radiant intensity]].

==Mathematical definitions==
===Irradiance===
'''Irradiance''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with [[Photometry|photometric]] quantities), is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16943|title=Thermal insulation — Heat transfer by radiation — Physical quantities and definitions|work=ISO 9288:1989|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] catalogue|year=1989|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{e} = \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial A},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*∂ is the [[partial derivative]] symbol;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the radiant flux ''received'';
*''A'' is the area.

If we want to talk about the radiant flux ''emitted'' by a surface, we speak of [[radiant exitance]].

===Spectral irradiance===
'''Spectral irradiance in frequency''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e,ν&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{e},\nu} = \frac{\partial E_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \nu},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ν'' is the frequency.

'''Spectral irradiance in wavelength''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e,λ&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = \frac{\partial E_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' is the wavelength.

==Property==
Irradiance of a ''surface'' is also, according to the definition of [[radiant flux]], equal to the time-average of the component of the [[Poynting vector]] perpendicular to the surface:
:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{e} = \langle|\mathbf{S}|\rangle \cos \alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt; • &gt; is the time-average;
*'''S''' is the Poynting vector;
*'''n''' is a unit vector [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to that surface;
*''α'' is the angle between '''n''' and '''S'''.

For a propagating ''sinusoidal'' [[Linear polarisation|linearly polarized]] electromagnetic [[plane wave]], the Poynting vector always points to the direction of propagation while oscillating in magnitude. The irradiance of a surface is then given by&lt;ref name=griffiths&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David J.|title=Introduction to electrodynamics|date=1999|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0-13-805326-X|url=http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Electrodynamics-3rd-David-Griffiths/dp/013805326X|edition=3. ed., reprint. with corr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{e} = \frac{n}{2 \mu_0 \mathrm{c}} E_\mathrm{m}^2 \cos \alpha = \frac{n \varepsilon_0 \mathrm{c}}{2} E_\mathrm{m}^2 \cos \alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''E''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the amplitude of the wave's electric field;
*''n'' is the [[refractive index]] of the medium of propagation;
*c is the [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]];
*μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permeability]];
*ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]].

This formula assumes that the [[magnetic susceptibility]] is negligible, i.e. that ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 1 where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[magnetic permeability]] of the propagation medium. This assumption is typically valid in transparent media in the optical frequency range.

==Solar energy==
The global irradiance on a horizontal surface on Earth consists of the direct irradiance ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e,dir&lt;/sub&gt; and diffuse irradiance ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e,diff&lt;/sub&gt;. On a tilted plane, there is another irradiance component, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e,refl&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the component that is reflected from the ground. The average ground reflection is about 20% of the global irradiance. Hence, the irradiance ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; on a tilted plane consists of three components:&lt;ref name=Quaschning&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quaschning |first=Volker |authorlink=Volker Quaschning |title=Technology fundamentals—The sun as an energy resource |journal=Renewable Energy World |volume=6 |date=2003 |issue=5 |pages=90–93 |url=http://www.volker-quaschning.de/articles/fundamentals1/index_e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{e} = E_{\mathrm{e},\mathrm{dir}} + E_{\mathrm{e},\mathrm{diff}} + E_{\mathrm{e},\mathrm{refl}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[integral]] of solar irradiance over a time period is called &quot;[[Radiant exposure|solar exposure]]&quot; or &quot;[[insolation]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Quaschning/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = B.

[[Image:Luminance Chamber.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Integrating sphere]] used for measuring the luminous flux of a light source.]]

In [[photometry (optics)|photometry]], '''luminous flux''' or '''luminous power''' is the measure of the perceived power of [[light]]. It differs from [[radiant flux]], the measure of the total power of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (including [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]], and visible light), in that luminous flux is adjusted to reflect the varying sensitivity of the [[human eye]] to different [[wavelength]]s of light.

==Units==
[[File:1 luminous.PNG|thumb|Luminous energy and power]]
The [[SI]] unit of luminous flux is the [[lumen (unit)|lumen]] (lm). One lumen is defined as the luminous flux of light produced by a light source that emits one [[candela]] of [[luminous intensity]] over a solid angle of one [[steradian]]. In other systems of units, luminous flux may have units of [[power (physics)|power]].

==Weighting==
The luminous flux accounts for the sensitivity of the eye by [[weighting]] the power at each wavelength with the [[luminosity function]], which represents the eye's response to different wavelengths. The luminous flux is a [[weighted sum]] of the power at all wavelengths in the visible band. Light outside the visible band does not contribute. The ratio of the total luminous flux to the radiant flux is called the [[luminous efficacy]].

==Context==
Luminous flux is often used as an objective measure of the useful light emitted by a [[Light#Light sources|light source]], and is typically reported on the packaging for [[Lamp (electrical component)|light bulbs]], although it is not always prominent. Consumers commonly compare the luminous flux of different light bulbs since it provides an estimate of the apparent amount of light the bulb will produce, and is useful when comparing the [[luminous efficacy]] of [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent]] and [[Compact fluorescent lamp|compact fluorescent]] bulbs.  

Energy conscious consumers can compare the luminous flux and the power usage (watts) of different light bulbs.  The ratio of  luminous flux to Power (watts) is useful for comparing the efficiencies of various light bulbs.

Luminous flux is not used to compare [[brightness]], as this is a subjective perception which varies according to the distance from the light source.

=== Relationship to luminous intensity ===
Luminous flux (in lumens) is a measure of the total amount of light a lamp puts out. The luminous intensity (in candelas) is a measure of how bright the beam in a particular direction is. If a lamp has a 1 lumen bulb and the optics of the lamp are set up to focus the light evenly into a 1 [[steradian]] beam, then the beam would have a luminous intensity of 1 candela. If the optics were changed to concentrate the beam into 1/2 steradian then the source would have a luminous intensity of 2 candela. The resulting beam is narrower and brighter, however the luminous flux remains the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3131">In [[plasma physics]], '''magnetic helicity''' quantifies the extent to which a [[magnetic field]] &quot;wraps around itself&quot;. It is a generalization of the topological concept of [[linking number]] to the differential quantities required to describe the magnetic field. As with many quantities in electromagnetism, magnetic helicity (which describes magnetic field lines) is closely related to fluid mechanical helicity (which describes fluid flow lines).

If magnetic field lines follow the strands of a twisted [[rope]], this configuration would have nonzero magnetic helicity; left-handed ropes would have negative values and right-handed ropes would have positive values.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

Formally,
:&lt;math&gt; H = \int {\mathbf A}\cdot{\mathbf B}\,d^3{\mathbf r} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf B}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic field strength
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf B}=\nabla\times{\mathbf A}&lt;/math&gt;; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vector potential]] of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf B}&lt;/math&gt;

Magnetic helicity has units of Wb&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Weber (unit)|weber]]s squared).  It is a [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved quantity]] in electromagnetic fields, even when [[magnetic reconnection]] dissipates [[energy]].   The concept is useful in [[Sun|solar dynamics]] and in [[dynamo theory]].&lt;ref&gt;

In [[physics]], the '''magnetomotive force''' is a quantity appearing in the equation for the [[magnetic flux]] in a [[magnetic circuit]], sometimes known as [[Hopkinson's law]]:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F} = \Phi \mathcal{R} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Φ'' is the magnetic flux and ''R'' is the [[reluctance]] of the circuit.  It can be seen that the magnetomotive force plays a role in this equation analogous to the voltage ''V'' in [[Ohm's law]]: ''V'' = ''IR''.

Magnetomotive force is analogous to [[electromotive force]], emf (= difference in electric potential, or voltage, between the terminals of a source of electricity, e.g., a battery from which no current is being drawn) since it is the cause of magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, R.J. (1966), ''Circuits, Devices and Systems'', pp 495-506, Wiley International Edition, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attaining maximum density==
Almost all known substances undergo [[thermal expansion]] in response to heating, meaning that a given mass of substance contracts to a low volume at low [[temperature]]s, when little [[thermal energy]] is present.  Substances, especially [[fluid]]s in which [[intermolecular force]]s are weak, also undergo [[compression (physical)|compression]] upon the application of [[pressure]].  Nearly all substances therefore reach a density maximum at very low temperatures and very high pressures, characteristic properties of the [[solid]] [[State of matter|state]] of [[matter]].

==Water==

An especially notable irregular maximum density is that of [[water]], which reaches a density peak at {{convert|3.98|°C|°F}}.

Mechanical impedance is the inverse of mechanical [[admittance]] or mobility. The mechanical impedance is a function of the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; of the applied force and can vary greatly over frequency. At [[resonance]] frequencies, the mechanical impedance will be lower, meaning less force is needed to cause a structure to move at a given velocity.  The simplest example of this is pushing a child on a swing.  For the greatest swing amplitude, the frequency of the pushes must be near the resonant frequency of the system.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}(\omega)=\mathbf{Z}(\omega)\mathbf{v}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the force vector, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity vector, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance matrix and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency.

Mechanical impedance is the ratio of a [[scalar potential|potential]] (e.g. force) to a flow (e.g. velocity) where the arguments of the real (or imaginary) parts of both increase linearly with time. Examples of potentials are: force, sound pressure, voltage, temperature. Examples of flows are: velocity, volume velocity, current, heat flow. Impedance is the reciprocal of mobility. If the potential and flow quantities are measured at the same point then impedance is referred as driving point impedance; otherwise, transfer impedance.

*Resistance - the real part of an impedance. 
*Reactance - the imaginary part of an impedance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4742">The '''molar volume''', symbol ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name=&quot;GreenBook&quot;&gt;{{GreenBookRef2nd|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[volume]] occupied by one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance ([[chemical element]] or [[chemical compound]]) at a given [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]. It is equal to the [[molar mass]] (''M'') divided by the [[mass density]] (ρ). It has the [[SI unit]] [[cubic metre]]s per mole (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol),&lt;ref name=&quot;GreenBook&quot;/&gt; although it is more practical to use the units [[cubic decimetre]]s per mole (dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol) for [[gas]]es and [[cubic centimetre]]s per mole (cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol) for [[liquid]]s and [[solid]]s.

The molar volume of a substance can be found by measuring its molar mass and density then applying the relation
::&lt;math&gt;V_{\rm m} = {M\over\rho}&lt;/math&gt;.
If the sample is a [[mixture]] containing ''N'' components, the molar volume is calculated using:
::&lt;math&gt;V_{\rm m} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}M_{i}}{\rho_{\mathrm{mixture}}}&lt;/math&gt;.
For [[ideal gas]]es, the molar volume is given by the [[ideal gas equation]]: this is a good approximation for many common gases at [[standard temperature and pressure]]. For [[Crystal|crystalline solids]], the molar volume can be measured by [[X-ray crystallography]].

== Ideal gases ==
The ideal gas equation can be rearranged to give an expression for the molar volume of an ideal gas:
::&lt;math&gt;V_{\rm m} = {V\over{n}} = {{RT}\over{P}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, for a given temperature and pressure, the molar volume is the same for all ideal gases and is known to the same precision as the [[gas constant]]: ''R''&amp;nbsp;= 0.08206 L&amp;nbsp; atm&amp;nbsp; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp; mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; , that is a [[Standard uncertainty|relative standard uncertainty]] of 9.1×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;, according to the 2010 [[CODATA]] recommended value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = CODATA value: molar gas constant | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?r | publisher = NIST | accessdate = 2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molar volume of an ideal gas at 100&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] (1&amp;nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]]) is
:22.710&amp;nbsp;980(38)&amp;nbsp;(dm)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol at 0&amp;nbsp;°C
:24.789&amp;nbsp;598(42)&amp;nbsp;(dm)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol at 25&amp;nbsp;°C
The molar volume of an ideal gas at 1 atmosphere of pressure is
:22.414 (dm)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol at 0&amp;nbsp;°C
:24.465 (dm)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol at 25&amp;nbsp;°C

== Crystalline solids ==
The [[unit cell]] volume (''V''&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt;) may be calculated from the [[unit cell parameter]]s, whose determination is the first step in an X-ray crystallography experiment (the calculation is performed automatically by the structure determination software). This is related to the molar volume by
::&lt;math&gt;V_{\rm m} = {{N_{\rm A}V_{\rm cell}}\over{Z}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]] and ''Z'' is the number of formula units in the unit cell. The result is normally reported as the &quot;crystallographic density&quot;.

=== Molar volume of silicon ===
[[Silicon]] is routinely made for the electronics industry, and the measurement of the molar volume of silicon, both by X-ray crystallography and by the ratio of molar mass to mass density, has attracted much attention since the pioneering work at [[NIST]] by Deslattes ''et al.'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Deslattes | first = R. D. |author2=Henins, A. |author3=Bowman, H. A. |author4=Schoonover, R. M. |author5=Carroll, C. L. |author6=Barnes, I.

The '''moment of inertia''', otherwise known as the '''angular mass''' or '''rotational inertia''', of a [[rigid body]] determines the [[torque]] needed for a desired [[angular acceleration]] about a rotational axis. It depends on the body's mass distribution and the axis chosen, with larger moments requiring more torque to change the body's rotation. It is an [[intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] (additive) property: the moment of inertia of a composite system is the sum of the moments of inertia of its component subsystems (all taken about the same axis). One of its definitions is the second moment of mass with respect to distance from an axis ''r'', &lt;math&gt;I = \int_m r^2 \mathrm dm &lt;/math&gt;, integrating over the entire mass.

For bodies constrained to rotate in a plane, it is sufficient to consider their moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the plane. For bodies free to rotate in three dimensions, their moments can be described by a symmetric 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 matrix; each body has a set of mutually perpendicular [[principal axis (mechanics)|principal axes]] for which this matrix is [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] and torques around the axes act independently of each other.

==Introduction==
When a body is rotating, or free to rotate, around an axis, a [[torque]] must be applied to change its [[angular momentum]].  The amount of torque needed for any given rate of change in angular momentum is proportional to the moment of inertia of the body. Moment of inertia may be expressed in terms of kilogram-square metres (kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in [[SI]] units and pound-square feet (lb&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;·ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in [[imperial units|imperial]] or [[United States customary units|US]] units.

Moment of inertia plays the role in rotational kinetics that Mass (inertia) plays in linear kinetics - both characterize the resistance of a body to changes in its motion.  The moment of inertia depends on how mass is distributed around an axis of rotation, and will vary depending on the chosen axis. For a point-like mass, the moment of inertia about some axis is given by ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''m'', where ''d'' is the distance to the axis, and ''m'' is the mass. For an extended body, the moment of inertia is just the sum of all the small pieces of mass multiplied by the square of their distances from the axis in question. For an extended body of a regular shape and uniform density, this summation sometimes produces a simple expression that depends on the dimensions, shape and total mass of the object.

In 1673 [[Christiaan Huygens]] introduced this parameter in his study of the oscillation of a body hanging from a pivot, known as a [[compound pendulum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mach&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mach |first=Ernst |title=The Science of Mechanics |year=1919 |pages=173&amp;ndash;187. |url=https://archive.org/details/scienceofmechani005860mbp |accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''moment of inertia'' was introduced by [[Leonhard Euler]] in his book ''Theoria motus corporum solidorum seu rigidorum'' in 1765,&lt;ref name=&quot;mach&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Euler1730&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Euler |first=Leonhard |title=Theoria motus corporum solidorum seu rigidorum: Ex primis nostrae cognitionis principiis stabilita et ad omnes motus, qui in huiusmodi corpora cadere possunt, accommodata [The theory of motion of solid or rigid bodies: established from first principles of our knowledge and appropriate for all motions which can occur in such bodies]|publisher= A.

Momentum inertiae corporis respectu eujuspiam axis est summa omnium productorum, quae oriuntur, si singula corporis elementa per quadrata distantiarum suarum ab axe multiplicentur.&quot;'' (Definition 7.  422.  A body's moment of inertia with respect to any axis is the sum of all of the products, which arise, if the individual elements of the body are multiplied by the square of their distances from the axis.)&lt;/ref&gt; and it is incorporated into [[Euler's laws#Euler's second law|Euler's second law]].

The natural frequency of oscillation of a compound pendulum is obtained from the ratio of the torque imposed by gravity on the mass of the pendulum to the resistance to acceleration defined by the moment of inertia.  Comparison of this natural frequency to that of a simple pendulum consisting of a single point of mass provides a mathematical formulation for moment of inertia of an extended body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marion 1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marion |first=JB |last2=Thornton |first2=ST |year=1995 |title=Classical dynamics of particles &amp; systems  |edition=4th |publisher=Thomson |isbn=0-03-097302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Symon 1971&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Symon |first=KR |year=1971 |title=Mechanics |edition=3rd |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-07392-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moment of inertia also appears in [[angular momentum|momentum]], [[kinetic energy]], and in [[rigid body dynamics|Newton's laws of motion]] for a rigid body as a physical parameter that combines its shape and mass.  There is an interesting difference in the way moment of inertia appears in planar and spatial movement.  Planar movement has a single scalar that defines the moment of inertia, while for spatial movement the same calculations yield a 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3 matrix of moments of inertia, called the inertia matrix or inertia tensor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenenbaum 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Tenenbaum |first=RA |year=2004 |title=Fundamentals of Applied Dynamics |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-00887-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane&quot;&gt;

The moment of inertia of a rotating flywheel is used in a machine to resist variations in applied torque to smooth its rotational output.  The moment of inertia of an airplane about its longitudinal, horizontal and vertical axes determines how steering forces on the control surfaces of its wings, elevators and tail affect the plane in roll, pitch and yaw.

Moment of inertia ''I'' is defined as the ratio of the [[angular momentum]] ''L'' of a system to its [[angular velocity]] ω around a principal axis, that is&lt;ref name=&quot;Winn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fullerton&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{L}{ \omega}.&lt;/math&gt;
If the angular momentum of a system is constant, then as the moment of inertia gets smaller, the angular velocity must increase. This occurs when spinning [[figure skating spins|figure skater]]s pull in their outstretched arms or [[Diving|diver]]s move [[Diving#Dive positions|from a straight position to a tuck position]] during a dive.

If the shape of the body does not change, then its moment of inertia appears in [[Rotation around a fixed axis|Newton's law of motion]] as the ratio of an [[torque|applied torque]] τ on a body to the [[angular acceleration]] α around a principal axis, that is
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = I \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

For a [[simple pendulum]],  this definition yields a formula for the moment of inertia ''I'' in terms of the mass ''m'' of the pendulum and its distance ''r'' from the pivot point as,
:&lt;math&gt; I=mr^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, moment of inertia depends on both the mass ''m'' of a body and its geometry, or shape, as defined by the distance ''r'' to the axis of rotation.

This simple formula generalizes to define moment of inertia for an arbitrarily shaped body as the sum of all the elemental point masses ''dm'' each multiplied by the square of its perpendicular distance ''r'' to an axis '''S''' .

In general, given an object of mass ''m'', an effective radius ''k'' can be defined for an axis through its center of mass, with such a value that its moment of inertia is

:&lt;math&gt; I=mk^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is known as the [[radius of gyration]].

==Simple pendulum==
Moment of inertia can be measured using a simple pendulum, because it is the resistance to the rotation caused by gravity. Mathematically, the moment of inertia of the pendulum is the ratio of the torque due to gravity about the pivot of a pendulum to its angular acceleration about that pivot point. For a simple pendulum this is found to be the product of the mass of the particle ''m'' with the square of its distance ''r'' to the pivot, that is
:&lt;math&gt; I=mr^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be shown as follows:
The force of gravity on the mass of a simple pendulum generates a torque &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \tau = \mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; around the axis perpendicular to the plane of the pendulum movement.  Here '''r''' is the distance vector perpendicular to and from the force to the torque axis.  Here '''F''' is the tangential component of the net force on the mass. Associated with this torque is an [[angular acceleration]], &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, of the string and mass around this axis. Since the mass is constrained to a circle the tangential acceleration of the mass is &lt;math&gt;\bold a = \boldsymbol\alpha \times \bold r &lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt; the torque equation becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau = \mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{r}\times (m \boldsymbol\alpha \times \bold r) = (mr^2)\boldsymbol\alpha = I\alpha \bold e,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''e''' is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the pendulum. (The second to the last step occurs because of the [[BAC-CAB rule]] using the fact that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is always perpendicular to '''r'''.) The quantity {{math|''I'' {{=}} ''mr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the ''moment of inertia'' of this single mass around the pivot point.

The quantity {{math|''I'' {{=}} ''mr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} also appears in the [[angular momentum]] of a simple pendulum, which is calculated from the velocity {{math|''v'' {{=}} '''ω'''×'''r'''}} of the pendulum mass around the pivot, where {{math|'''ω'''}} is the [[angular velocity]] of the mass about the pivot point. This angular momentum is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r}\times(m\mathbf{v}) = (mr^2)\boldsymbol\omega = I\omega\bold e,&lt;/math&gt;
using math similar to that used to derive the previous equation.

Similarly, the kinetic energy of the pendulum mass is defined by the velocity of the pendulum around the pivot to yield
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{K} = \frac{1}{2}m\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{2}(mr^2)\omega^2 = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that the quantity {{math|''I'' {{=}} ''mr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is how mass combines with the shape of a body to define rotational inertia.  The moment of inertia of an arbitrarily shaped body is the sum of the values {{mvar|mr}}{{sup|2}} for all of the elements of mass in the body.

==Compound pendulum==

A [[compound pendulum]] is a body formed from an assembly of particles of continuous shape that rotates rigidly around a pivot. Its moment of inertia is the sum of the moments of inertia of each of the particles that it is composed of.&lt;ref name=&quot;B-Paul&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The [[Resonance|natural]] [[Angular frequency|frequency]] (&lt;math&gt; \omega_n&lt;/math&gt;) of a compound pendulum depends on its moment of inertia, &lt;math&gt;I_P&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{mgr}{I_P}},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is local acceleration of gravity, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the pivot point to the centre of mass of the object. Measuring this frequency of oscillation over small angular displacements provides an effective way of measuring moment of inertia of a body.&lt;ref name =&quot;Uicker&quot;/&gt;{{rp|516–517}}

Thus, to determine the moment of inertia of the body, simply suspend it from a convenient pivot point &lt;math&gt;_P&lt;/math&gt; so that it swings freely in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the desired moment of inertia, then measure its natural frequency or period of oscillation (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;), to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; I_P = \frac{mgr}{\omega_n^2} = \frac{mgrt^2}{4\pi^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the period (duration) of oscillation (usually averaged over multiple periods).

The moment of inertia of the body about its centre of mass, &lt;math&gt;I_C&lt;/math&gt;, is then calculated using the [[parallel axis theorem]] to be
:&lt;math&gt; I_C = I_P - mr^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the body and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the pivot point &lt;math&gt;_P&lt;/math&gt; to the centre of mass &lt;math&gt;_C&lt;/math&gt;.

Moment of inertia of a body is often defined in terms of its ''[[radius of gyration]]'', which is the radius of a ring of equal mass around the centre of mass of a body that has the same moment of inertia.  The radius of gyration &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is calculated from the body's moment of inertia &lt;math&gt;I_C&lt;/math&gt; and mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; as the length,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beer&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1296–1297}}
:&lt;math&gt;K=\sqrt{\frac{I_C}{m}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Center of oscillation===
A simple pendulum that has the same natural frequency as a compound pendulum defines the length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; from the pivot to a point called the [[centre of oscillation]] of the compound pendulum.  This point also corresponds to the [[centre of percussion]].  The length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is determined from the formula,
:&lt;math&gt; \omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}=\sqrt{\frac{mgr}{I_P}},&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{g}{\omega_n^2} = \frac{I_P}{mr}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[seconds pendulum]], which provides the &quot;tick&quot; and &quot;tock&quot; of a grandfather clock, takes one second to swing from side-to-side.  This is a period of  two seconds, or a natural frequency of π radians/second for the pendulum.  In this case, the distance to the center of oscillation, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, can be computed to be
:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{g}{\omega_n^2}=\frac{9.81 \ \mathrm{m/s^2}}{(3.14 \ \mathrm{rad/s})^2}=0.99 \ \mathrm{m}.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the distance to the center of oscillation of the seconds pendulum must be adjusted to accommodate different values for the local acceleration of gravity.  [[Kater's pendulum]] is a compound pendulum that uses this property to measure the local acceleration of gravity, and is called a [[gravimeter]].

==Measuring moment of inertia==
The moment of inertia of complex systems such as a vehicle or airplane around its vertical axis can be measured by suspending the system from three points to form a trifilar pendulum.  A trifilar pendulum is a platform supported by three wires designed to oscillate in torsion around its vertical centroidal axis.&lt;ref&gt;H. Williams, [http://www.ima.org.uk/_db/_documents/maths07_williams_huw.pdf Measuring the inertia tensor], presented at the IMA Mathematics 2007 Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; The period of oscillation of the trifilar pendulum yields the moment of inertia of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Gracey, William, The experimental determination of the moments of inertia of airplanes by a simplified compound-pendulum method, [http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1948/naca-tn-1629.pdf NACA Technical Note No. 1629], 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculating moment of inertia about an axis ==
[[File:Rolling Racers - Moment of inertia.gif|thumb|right|Four objects with identical masses and radii racing down a plane while rolling without slipping. From back to front: spherical shell (red), solid sphere (orange), cylindrical ring (green) and solid cylinder (blue). The time for each object to reach the finishing line depends on their moment of inertia. ([[:File:Rolling Racers - Moment of inertia.ogv|OGV version]])]]

The moment of inertia about an axis of a body is calculated by summing mr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for every particle in the body, where ''r'' is the perpendicular distance to the specified axis. To see how moment of inertia arises in the study of the movement of an extended body, it is convenient to consider a rigid assembly of point masses. (This equation can be used for axes that are not principal axes provided that it is understood that this does not fully describe the moment of inertia.&lt;ref&gt;In that situation this moment of inertia only describes how a torque applied along that axis causes a rotation about that axis. But, torques not aligned along a principal axis will also cause rotations about other axes.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Consider the kinetic energy of an assembly of {{mvar|N}} masses {{mvar|m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} that lie at the distances  {{mvar|r{{sub|i}} }} from the pivot point ''P'', which is the nearest point on the axis of rotation. It is the sum of the kinetic energy of the individual masses,&lt;ref name=&quot;Uicker&quot;&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E_\text{K} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\frac12\,m_i \mathbf{v}_i\cdot\mathbf{v}_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\frac12\,m_i (\omega r_i)^2\right) = \frac12\, \omega^2 \sum_{i=1}^N m_i r_i^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that the moment of inertia of the body is the sum of each of the mr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; terms, that is
: &lt;math&gt; I_P = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i r_i^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, moment of inertia is a physical property that combines the mass and distribution of the particles around the rotation axis.  Notice that rotation about different axes of the same body yield different moments of inertia.

The moment of inertia of a continuous body rotating about a specified axis is calculated in the same way, except with infinitely many point particles. Thus the limits of summation are removed, and the sum is written as follows: 

: &lt;math&gt; I_P = \sum_{i} m_i r_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

Another expression replaces the summation with an [[multiple integral|integral]],
: &lt;math&gt;I_P = \iiint\limits_{S} \rho\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\left\Vert\mathbf{r}\right\Vert^2 \, dV&lt;/math&gt;
Again '''r''' is the [[radius vector]] to a point in the body from the specified axis through the pivot ''P'', and {{mvar|ρ}}('''r''') is the mass density at each point '''r'''. The integration is evaluated over the volume&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} of the body&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|S}}. The moment of inertia of a flat surface is similar with the mass density being replaced by its areal mass density with the integral evaluated over its area.

'''''Note on second moment of area''''':  The moment of inertia of a body moving in a plane and the [[second moment of area]] of a beam's cross-section are often confused.  The moment of inertia of body with the shape of the cross-section is the second moment of this area about the z-axis perpendicular to the cross-section, weighted by its density.  This is also called the ''polar moment of the area'', and is the sum of the second moments about the x and y axes.&lt;ref&gt;Walter D. Pilkey, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4hEsqvplmFMC&amp;pg=PA437&amp;dq=polar+moment+of+inertia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1vxkUbj1JIr-rQH-5oC4Bg&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22polar%20moment%20of%20inertia%22&amp;f=false Analysis and Design of Elastic Beams: Computational Methods], John Wiley, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  The stresses in a [[beam (structure)|beam]] are calculated using the second moment of the cross-sectional area around either the x-axis or y-axis depending on the load.

=== Example calculation of moment of inertia ===
{{main|List of moments of inertia}}
[[File:Moment of inertia rod center.svg|thumb|right]]

The moment of inertia of a '''compound pendulum''' constructed from a thin disc mounted at the end of a thin rod that oscillates around a pivot at the other end of the rod, begins with the calculation of the moment of inertia of the thin rod and thin disc about their respective centres of mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beer&quot;/&gt;

*The moment of inertia of a '''thin rod''' with constant cross-section {{mvar|s}} and density ρ and with length {{mvar|ℓ}} about a perpendicular axis through its centre of mass is determined by integration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beer&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1301}}  Align the x-axis with the rod and locate the origin its centre of mass at the centre of the rod, then
: &lt;math&gt; I_{C, \text{rod}} = \int \rho\,x^2 dV = \int_{-\ell/2}^{\ell/2} \rho\,x^2 sdx = \rho s\frac{x^3}{3}\bigg|_{-\ell/2}^{\ell/2} = \frac{\rho s}{3} \left(\frac{\ell^3}{8} + \frac{\ell^3}{8}\right) = \frac{1}{12}\, m\ell^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''ρsℓ''}} is the mass of the rod.

*The moment of inertia of a '''thin disc''' of constant thickness {{mvar|s}}, radius {{mvar|R}}, and density {{mvar|ρ}} about an axis through its centre and perpendicular to its face (parallel to its axis of [[rotational symmetry]]) is determined by integration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beer&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1301}}  Align the z-axis with the axis of the disc and define a volume element as {{math|''dV'' {{=}} ''sr drdθ''}}, then
:&lt;math&gt; I_{C, \text{disc}} = \int \rho r^2 dV = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^R \rho r^2 (s r dr d\theta) = 2\pi \rho s \frac{R^4}{4} = \frac{1}{2}mR^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''πR''{{sup|2}}''ρs''}} is its mass.

*The moment of inertia of the compound pendulum is now obtained by adding the moment of inertia of the rod and the disc around the pivot point ''P'' as,
:&lt;math&gt; I_P =  I_{C, \text{rod}} + M_\text{rod}\left(\frac{L}{2}\right)^2 +  I_{C, \text{disc}}  + M_\text{disc}(L+R)^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the length of the pendulum.  Notice that the parallel axis theorem is used to shift the moment of inertia from the centre of mass to the pivot point of the pendulum.

A [[list of moments of inertia]] formulas for standard body shapes provides a way to obtain the moment of inertial of a complex body as an assembly of simpler shaped bodies.  The [[parallel axis theorem]] is used to shift the reference point of the individual bodies to the reference point of the assembly.

[[File:Moment of inertia solid sphere.svg|right|thumb]]
As one more example, consider the moment of inertia of a solid sphere of constant density about an axis through its centre of mass.  This is determined by summing the moments of inertia of the thin discs that form the sphere.  If the surface of the ball is defined by the equation&lt;ref name=&quot;Beer&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1301}}
:&lt;math&gt; x^2+y^2+z^2 = R^2,&lt;/math&gt;

then the radius ''r'' of the disc at the cross-section z along the z-axis is
:&lt;math&gt;r(z)^2 = x^2+y^2 = R^2 - z^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the moment of inertia of the ball is the sum of the moments of inertia of the discs along the z-axis,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  I_{C, \text{ball}} &amp;= \int_{-R}^{R}  \frac{\pi \rho}{2} r(z)^4 dz=  \int_{-R}^{R}  \frac{\pi \rho}{2} (R^2 - z^2)^2 dz \\
                     &amp;= \frac{\pi \rho}{2}\left(R^4z - \frac{2}{3}R^2z^3 + \frac{1}{5}z^5\right)\bigg|_{-R}^{R} \\
                     &amp;= \pi \rho\left(1 - \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{5}\right)R^5 \\
                     &amp;= \frac{2}{5}mR^2,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m'' {{=}} {{sfrac|4|3}}π''R''{{sup|3}}''ρ''}} is the mass of the ball.

== Moment of inertia in planar movement of a rigid body ==
If a [[mechanical system]] is constrained to move parallel to a fixed plane, then the rotation of a body in the system occurs around an axis {{math|''k''}} perpendicular to this plane.  In this case, the moment of inertia of the mass in this system is a scalar known as the ''polar moment of inertia''.  The definition of the polar moment of inertia can be obtained by considering momentum, kinetic energy and Newton's laws for the planar movement of a rigid system of particles.&lt;ref name=&quot;B-Paul&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Uicker&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldstein |first=H. |year=1980 |title=Classical Mechanics |edition=2nd |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-02918-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, [https://archive.org/details/Mechanics_541 Mechanics], Vol 1. 2nd Ed., Pergamon Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a system of {{mvar|n}} particles, {{math|''P{{sub|i}}'', ''i'' {{=}} 1,...,''n''}}, are assembled into a rigid body, then the momentum of the system can be written in terms of positions relative to a reference point '''R''', and absolute velocities {{math|'''v'''{{sub|i}} }}
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}, \quad \mathbf{v}_i = \boldsymbol\omega\times(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}) + \mathbf{V},&lt;/math&gt;
where ω is the angular velocity of the system and {{math|'''V'''}} is the velocity of {{math|'''R'''}}.

For planar movement the angular velocity vector is directed along the unit vector {{mvar|k}} which is perpendicular to the plane of movement.  Introduce the unit vectors {{math|'''e'''{{sub|i}} }}from the reference point {{math|'''R'''}} to a point {{math|'''r'''{{sub|i}} }}, and the unit vector {{math|'''t'''{{sub|i}} {{=}} ''k'' &amp;times; '''e'''{{sub|i}} }} so
:&lt;math&gt;  \Delta r_i\mathbf{e}_i =  \mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R}, \quad \mathbf{v}_i = \omega  \Delta r_i\mathbf{t}_i + \mathbf{V},\quad i=1,\dots, n.&lt;/math&gt;
This defines the relative position vector and the velocity vector for the rigid system of the particles moving in a plane.

'''''Note on the cross product''''':  When a body moves parallel to a ground plane, the trajectories of all the points in the body lie in planes parallel to this ground plane.  This means that any rotation that the body undergoes must be around an axis perpendicular to this plane.  Planar movement is often presented as projected onto this ground plane so that the axis of rotation appears as a point.  In this case, the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the body are scalars and the fact that they are vectors along the rotation axis is ignored.  This is usually preferred for introductions to the topic.  But in the case of moment of inertia, the combination of mass and geometry benefits from the geometric properties of the cross product.  For this reason, in this section on planar movement the angular velocity and accelerations of the body are vectors perpendicular to the ground plane, and the cross product operations are the same as used for the study of spatial rigid body movement.

===Angular momentum in planar movement===
The angular momentum vector for the planar movement of a rigid system of particles is given by&lt;ref name=&quot;B-Paul&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Uicker&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{L} &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n \left[m_i (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R})\times\mathbf{v}_i\right] \\
             &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n \left[m_i \Delta r_i\mathbf{e}_i \times(\omega \Delta r_i\mathbf{t}_i + \mathbf{V})\right] \\
             &amp;= \left[\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \Delta r_i^2\right]\omega \vec{k} + \left[\sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i\Delta r_i\mathbf{e}_i\right)\right] \times \mathbf{V}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Use the [[centre of mass]] '''C''' as the reference point so
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                               \Delta r_i\mathbf{e}_i &amp;= \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{C}, \\
  \sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i\Delta r_i\mathbf{e}_i\right) &amp;= 0,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and define the moment of inertia relative to the centre of mass I{{sub|C}} as
:&lt;math&gt; I_C = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i\Delta r_i^2,&lt;/math&gt;

then the equation for angular momentum simplifies to&lt;ref name=&quot;Beer&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1028}}
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L} = I_C \omega \vec{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The moment of inertia {{mvar|I{{sub|C}} }} about an axis perpendicular to the movement of the rigid system and through the centre of mass is known as the ''polar moment of inertia''.

For a given amount of angular momentum, a decrease in the moment of inertia results in an increase in the angular velocity.  Figure skaters can change their moment of inertia by pulling in their arms.  Thus, the angular velocity achieved by a skater with outstretched arms results in a greater angular velocity when the arms are pulled in, because of the reduced moment of inertia.

===Kinetic energy in planar movement===
[[File:Lever shear flywheel.jpg|thumb|This 1906 rotary shear uses the moment of inertia of two flywheels to store kinetic energy which when released is used to cut metal stock (International Library of Technology, 1906).]]
The kinetic energy of a rigid system of particles moving in the plane is given by&lt;ref name=&quot;B-Paul&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Uicker&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{K} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i \mathbf{v}_i\cdot\mathbf{v}_i\right) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i (\omega \Delta r_i\mathbf{t}_i + \mathbf{V})\cdot(\omega \Delta r_i\mathbf{t}_i + \mathbf{V})\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This equation expands to yield three terms
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{K} = \frac{1}{2}\omega^2\sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i \Delta r_i^2(\mathbf{t}_i\cdot\mathbf{t}_i)\right) + \omega\mathbf{V}\cdot\left(\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \Delta r_i\mathbf{t}_i\right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\right) \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{V}.&lt;/math&gt;
Let the reference point be the centre of mass '''C''' of the system so the second term becomes zero, and introduce the moment of inertia I{{sub|C}} so the kinetic energy is given by&lt;ref name=&quot;Beer&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1084}}
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{K} = \frac{1}{2}I_C \omega^2 + \frac{1}{2}M\mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{V}.&lt;/math&gt;
The moment of inertia I{{sub|C}} is the ''polar moment of inertia'' of the body.

===Newton's laws for planar movement===
[[File:Johndeered.jpg|thumb|A 1920s John Deere tractor with the spoked [[flywheel]] on the engine. The large moment of inertia of the flywheel smooths the operation of the tractor]]
Newton's laws for a rigid system of N particles, {{math|''P{{sub|i}}'', ''i'' {{=}} 1,..., ''N''}}, can be written in terms of a [[resultant force]] and torque at a reference point {{math|'''R'''}}, to yield&lt;ref name=&quot;B-Paul&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Uicker&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       \mathbf{F} &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^N m_i\mathbf{A}_i, \\
  \boldsymbol\tau &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^N (\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R}) \times m_i\mathbf{A}_i,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''r'''{{sub|i}} }} denotes the trajectory of each particle.

The [[kinematics]] of a rigid body yields the formula for the acceleration of the particle {{mvar|P{{sub|i}} }} in terms of the position {{math|'''R'''}} and acceleration {{math|'''A'''}} of the reference particle as well as the angular velocity vector {{mvar|ω}} and angular acceleration vector {{mvar|α}} of the rigid system of particles as,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}_i = \boldsymbol\alpha\times(\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R})  + \boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\omega\times(\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R})  + \mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

For systems that are constrained to planar movement, the angular velocity and angular acceleration vectors are directed along {{math|''k''}} perpendicular to the plane of movement, which simplifies this acceleration equation.  In this case, the acceleration vectors can be simplified by introducing the unit vectors {{math|'''e'''{{sub|i}} }} from the reference point {{math|'''R'''}} to a point {{math|'''r'''{{sub|i}} }} and the unit vectors {{math|'''t'''{{sub|i}} {{=}} ''k'' &amp;times; '''e'''{{sub|i}} }}, so
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}_i =  \alpha(\Delta r_i\mathbf{t}_{i}) - \omega^2(\Delta r_i\mathbf{e}_{i}) + \mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

This yields the resultant torque on the system as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \boldsymbol\tau &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\left[m_i\Delta r_i\mathbf{e}_i\right] \times \left[\alpha(\Delta r_i\mathbf{t}_{i}) - \omega^2(\Delta r_i\mathbf{e}_{i}) + \mathbf{A}\right]\right) \\
                  &amp;= \left(\sum_{i=1}^N m_i\Delta r_i^2\right)\alpha\vec{k} + \left(\sum_{i=1}^N m_i\Delta r_i\mathbf{e}_i\right) \times\mathbf{A},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''e'''{{sub|i}} &amp;times; '''e'''{{sub|i}} {{=}} 0}}, and {{math|'''e'''{{sub|i}} &amp;times; '''t'''{{sub|i}} {{=}} ''k''}} is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane for all of the particles {{mvar|P{{sub|i}} }}.

Use the [[centre of mass]] {{math|'''C'''}} as the reference point and define the moment of inertia relative to the centre of mass {{mvar|I{{sub|C}} }}, then the equation for the resultant torque simplifies to&lt;ref name=&quot;Beer&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1029}}
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau = I_C\alpha\vec{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The parameter {{mvar|I{{sub|C}} }} is the ''polar moment of inertia'' of the moving body.

==The inertia matrix for spatial movement of a rigid body==
The scalar moments of inertia appear as elements in a matrix when a system of particles is assembled into a rigid body that moves in three-dimensional space.  This inertia matrix appears in the calculation of the angular momentum, kinetic energy and resultant torque of the rigid system of particles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marion 1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Symon 1971&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenenbaum 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsai&quot;&gt;L. W. Tsai, Robot Analysis: The mechanics of serial and parallel manipulators, John-Wiley, NY, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important application of the inertia matrix and Newton's laws of motion is the analysis of a spinning top.  This is discussed in the article on [[gyroscopic precession]].  A more detailed presentation can be found in the article on [[Euler's equations (rigid body dynamics)|Euler's equations of motion]].

Let the system of particles {{math|''P{{sub|i}}'', ''i'' {{=}} 1,..., ''n''}} be located at the coordinates {{math|'''r'''{{sub|i}} }} with velocities {{math|'''v'''{{sub|i}} }} relative to a fixed reference frame.  For a (possibly moving) reference point {{math|'''R'''}}, the relative positions are
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{r}_i=\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;
and the (absolute) velocities are
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_i = \boldsymbol\omega\times\Delta\mathbf{r}_i + \mathbf{V}_R&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|ω}} is the angular velocity of the system, and {{math|'''V'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is the velocity of {{math|'''R'''}}.

===Angular momentum===
If the reference point ''R'' in the assembly, or body, is chosen as the centre of mass ''C'', then its angular momentum takes the form,&lt;ref name=&quot;Marion 1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L} = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times \mathbf{v}_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\right) = -\sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times(\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times\boldsymbol\omega)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where the terms containing {{math|'''V'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; sum to zero by definition of the [[centre of mass]].

To define the inertia matrix, let us first note that a skew-symmetric matrix [{{mvar|B}}] could be constructed from a vector {{math|'''b'''}} that performs the cross product operation, such that
:&lt;math&gt; [B]\mathbf{y} =\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{y}.&lt;/math&gt;
This matrix [{{mvar|B}}] has the components of {{math|'''b''' {{=}} }} {{mvar|(b{{sub|x}}, b{{sub|y}},b{{sub|z}})}} as its elements, in the form
:&lt;math&gt; [B] = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -b_z &amp; b_y \\ b_z &amp; 0 &amp; -b_x \\ -b_y &amp; b_x &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now construct the skew-symmetric matrix [Δr&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]= [{{mvar|r{{sub|i}}-C}}] obtained from the relative position vector Δ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;={{math|'''r'''{{sub|i}} - '''C'''}}, and use this skew-symmetric matrix to define,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L} = \left(-\sum_{i=1}^n m_i [\Delta r_i]^2\right)\boldsymbol\omega = [I_C]\boldsymbol\omega,&lt;/math&gt;
where [{{mvar|I{{sub|C}} }}] defined by
:&lt;math&gt; [I_C] = -\sum_{i=1}^n m_i[\Delta r_i]^2,&lt;/math&gt;
is the symmetric  inertia matrix of the rigid system of particles measured relative to the centre of mass ''C''.

===Kinetic energy===
The kinetic energy of a rigid system of particles can be formulated in terms of the [[centre of mass]] and a matrix of mass moments of inertia of the system.   Let the system of particles {{math|''P{{sub|i}}'', ''i'' {{=}} 1,...,''n''}} be located at the coordinates '''r'''{{sub|i}} with velocities '''v'''{{sub|i}}, then the kinetic energy is&lt;ref name=&quot;Marion 1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{K} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i \mathbf{v}_i\cdot\mathbf{v}_i\right) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i (\boldsymbol\omega\times\Delta\mathbf{r}_i + \mathbf{V}_C)\cdot(\boldsymbol\omega\times\Delta\mathbf{r}_i + \mathbf{V}_C)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where Δ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;= '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-'''C''' is the position vector of a particle relative to the centre of mass.

This equation expands to yield three terms
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{K} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i (\boldsymbol\omega\times\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) \cdot(\boldsymbol\omega\times\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\right) + \sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i \mathbf{V}_C\cdot(\boldsymbol\omega\times\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\right) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i \mathbf{V}_C\cdot\mathbf{V}_C\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The second term in this equation is zero because '''C''' is the centre of mass.  Introduce the skew-symmetric matrix [Δr{{sub|i}}] so the kinetic energy becomes
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{K} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i ([\Delta r_i]\boldsymbol\omega)\cdot([\Delta r_i]\boldsymbol\omega)\right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\right) \mathbf{V}_C\cdot\mathbf{V}_C.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{K} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(m_i (\boldsymbol\omega^T[\Delta r_i]^T[\Delta r_i]\boldsymbol\omega)\right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\right) \mathbf{V}_C\cdot\mathbf{V}_C.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{K} = \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol\omega\cdot\left(-\sum_{i=1}^n m_i [\Delta r_i ]^2\right) \boldsymbol\omega + \frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\right) \mathbf{V}_C\cdot\mathbf{V}_C.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the kinetic energy of the rigid system of particles is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{K} = \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol\omega\cdot[I_C]\boldsymbol\omega + \frac{1}{2}M\mathbf{V}_C^2.&lt;/math&gt;
where [I{{sub|C}}] is the inertia matrix relative to the centre of mass and M is the total mass.

===Resultant torque===
The inertia matrix appears in the application of Newton's second law to a rigid assembly of particles.  The resultant torque on this system is,&lt;ref name=&quot;Marion 1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau = \sum_{i=1}^n \left((\mathbf{r_i}-\mathbf{R})\times (m_i\mathbf{a}_i)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where '''a'''{{sub|i}} is the acceleration of the particle P{{sub|i}}.  The [[kinematics]] of a rigid body yields the formula for the acceleration of the particle P{{sub|i}} in terms of the position '''R''' and acceleration '''A''' of the reference point, as well as the angular velocity vector ω and angular acceleration vector α of the rigid system as,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_i = \boldsymbol\alpha\times(\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R})  + \boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\omega\times(\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R})  + \mathbf{A}_R.&lt;/math&gt;

Use the centre of mass '''C''' as the reference point, and introduce the skew-symmetric matrix  [Δr&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]=[r{{sub|i}}-C] to represent the cross product ('''r'''{{sub|i}} - '''C''')x, to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau = \left(-\sum_{i=1}^n m_i[\Delta r_i]^2\right)\boldsymbol\alpha + \boldsymbol\omega\times\left(-\sum_{i=1}^n m_i [\Delta r_i]^2\right)\boldsymbol\omega&lt;/math&gt;
The calculation uses the identity
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times\Delta\mathbf{r}_i )) + \boldsymbol\omega\times((\boldsymbol\omega\times\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\times\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
obtained from the [[Jacobi identity]] for the triple [[cross product]] as shown in the proof below:

!Proof
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol\tau &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf{r_i}-\mathbf{R})\times (m_i\mathbf{a}_i) \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n \boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (m_i\mathbf{a}_i) \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i [\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times \mathbf{a}_i]\;\ldots\text{ cross-product scalar multiplication} \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i [\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\mathbf{a}_{\text{tangential},i} + \mathbf{a}_{\text{centripetal},i} + \mathbf{A}_R)] \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i [\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\mathbf{a}_{\text{tangential},i} + \mathbf{a}_{\text{centripetal},i} + 0)] \\
&amp;\;\;\;\;\;\ldots\;\mathbf{R}\text{ is either at rest or moving at a constant velocity but not accelerated, or } \\
&amp;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\text{the origin of the fixed (world) coordinate reference system is placed at the centre of mass }\mathbf{C} \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i [\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times \mathbf{a}_{\text{tangential},i} + \boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times \mathbf{a}_{\text{centripetal},i}]\;\ldots\text{ cross-product distributivity over addition} \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i [\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\boldsymbol\alpha\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) + \boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\boldsymbol\omega\times\mathbf{v}_{\text{tangential},i})] \\
\boldsymbol\tau &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i [\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\boldsymbol\alpha\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) + \boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\boldsymbol\omega\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i))] \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Then, the following [[Jacobi identity]] is used on the last term:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\boldsymbol\omega\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)) + \boldsymbol\omega\times((\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) + (\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\times(\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times\boldsymbol\omega) &amp;= 0 \\
\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\boldsymbol\omega\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)) + \boldsymbol\omega\times((\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) + (\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\times -(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) &amp;= 0\;\ldots\text{ cross-product anticommutativity} \\
\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\boldsymbol\omega\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)) + \boldsymbol\omega\times((\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) + -[(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)] &amp;= 0\;\ldots\text{ cross-product scalar multiplication} \\
\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\boldsymbol\omega\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)) + \boldsymbol\omega\times((\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) + -[0] &amp;= 0\;\ldots\text{ self cross-product} \\
\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\boldsymbol\omega\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)) + \boldsymbol\omega\times((\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) &amp;= 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The result of applying [[Jacobi identity]] can then be continued as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\boldsymbol\omega\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)) &amp;= -[\boldsymbol\omega\times((\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)] \\
&amp;= -[(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)(\boldsymbol\omega\cdot\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) - \boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i(\boldsymbol\omega\cdot(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i))]\;\ldots\text{ vector triple product} \\
&amp;= -[(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)(\boldsymbol\omega\cdot\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) - \boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i(\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\cdot(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\omega))]\;\ldots\text{ scalar triple product} \\
&amp;= -[(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)(\boldsymbol\omega\cdot\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i) - \boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i(\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\cdot(0))]\;\ldots\text{ self cross-product} \\
&amp;= -[(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)(\boldsymbol\omega\cdot\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)] \\
&amp;= -[\boldsymbol\omega\times(\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i (\boldsymbol\omega\cdot\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i))]\;\ldots\text{ cross-product scalar multiplication} \\
&amp;= \boldsymbol\omega\times -(\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i (\boldsymbol\omega\cdot\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i))\;\ldots\text{ cross-product scalar multiplication} \\
\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i\times (\boldsymbol\omega\times(\boldsymbol\omega\times\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)) &amp;= \boldsymbol\omega\times -(\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i (\boldsymbol\Delta\mathbf{r}_i \cdot \boldsymbol\omega))\;\ldots\text{ dot-product commutativity} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The final result can then be substituted to the main proof as follows:

\boldsymbol\tau &amp;= \left(-\sum_{i=1}^n m_i [\Delta r_i]^2\right) \boldsymbol\alpha + \boldsymbol\omega\times \left(-\sum_{i=1}^n m_i [\Delta r_i]^2\right) \boldsymbol\omega
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Thus, the resultant torque on the rigid system of particles is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau = [I_C]\boldsymbol\alpha + \boldsymbol\omega\times[I_C]\boldsymbol\omega,&lt;/math&gt;
where [I{{sub|C}}] is the inertia matrix relative to the centre of mass.

===Parallel axis theorem===
{{Main|Parallel axis theorem}}
The inertia matrix of a body depends on the choice of the reference point.  There is a useful relationship between the inertia matrix relative to the centre of mass '''C''' and the inertia matrix relative to another point '''R'''.  This relationship is called the parallel axis theorem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marion 1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane&quot;/&gt;

Consider the inertia matrix [I{{sub|R}}] obtained for a rigid system of particles measured relative to a reference point '''R''', given by
:&lt;math&gt; [I_R] = -\sum_{i=1}^n m_i[r_i-R]^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Let '''C''' be the centre of mass of the rigid system, then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R} = (\mathbf{R}-\mathbf{C}) + \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{d} + \mathbf{C},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''d''' is the vector from the centre of mass '''C''' to the reference point '''R'''.  Use this equation to compute the inertia matrix,
:&lt;math&gt; [I_R] = -\sum_{i=1}^n m_i[r_i - C - d]^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Expand this equation to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;  [I_R] =  \left(-\sum_{i=1}^n m_i [r_i - C]^2\right) + \left(\sum_{i=1}^n m_i[r_i-C]\right)[d]+[d]\left(\sum_{i=1}^n m_i[r_i-C]\right)+\left(-\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\right)[d][d].&lt;/math&gt;
The first term is the inertia matrix [I{{sub|C}}] relative to the centre of mass.  The second and third terms are zero by definition of the centre of mass '''C'''.  And the last term is the total mass of the system multiplied by the square of the skew-symmetric matrix [d] constructed from '''d'''.

The result is the parallel axis theorem,
:&lt;math&gt; [I_R] = [I_C] - M[d]^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''d''' is the vector from the centre of mass '''C''' to the reference point '''R'''.

'''Note on the minus sign''':  By using the skew symmetric matrix of position vectors relative to the reference point, the inertia matrix of each particle has the form −''m''[r]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is similar to the ''mr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that appears in planar movement.  However, to make this to work out correctly a minus sign is needed.  This minus sign can be absorbed into the term ''m''[r]&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;[r], if desired, by using the skew-symmetry property of [r].

==The inertia matrix and the scalar moment of inertia around an arbitrary axis==
The scalar moment of inertia, I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, of a body about a specified axis whose direction is specified by the unit vector '''S''' and passes through the body at a point '''R''' is as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_L = \mathbf{S}\cdot\left[-\sum_{i=1}^N m_i [\Delta r_i]^2\right]\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{S}\cdot[I_R]\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{S}^T[I_R]\mathbf{S},&lt;/math&gt;
where [I{{sub|R}}] is the moment of inertia matrix of the system relative to the reference point '''R'''.

This is derived as follows. Let a rigid assembly of {{mvar|N}} particles, {{math|''P{{sub|i}}'', ''i'' {{=}} 1,...,''N''}}, have coordinates '''r'''{{sub|i}}.   Choose '''R''' as a reference point and compute the moment of inertia around an axis L defined by the unit vector '''S''' through the reference point '''R'''.  The moment of inertia of the system around this line L='''R'''+t'''S''' is computed by determining the perpendicular vector from this axis to the particle P{{sub|i}} given by
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\mathbf{r}_i ^\perp= (\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R}) - (\mathbf{S}\cdot(\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R}))\mathbf{S} = [[I]-[\mathbf{S}\mathbf{S}^T]](\Delta\mathbf{r}_i),&lt;/math&gt;
where [I] is the identity matrix and ['''S''' '''S'''{{sup|T}}] is the outer product matrix formed from the unit vector '''S''' along the line L.

To relate this scalar moment of inertia to the inertia matrix of the body, introduce the skew-symmetric matrix [S] such that [S]'''y'''='''S''' x '''y''', then we have the identity
:&lt;math&gt; -[S]^2 = [I]-[\mathbf{S}\mathbf{S}^T],&lt;/math&gt;
which relies on the fact that '''S''' is a unit vector.

The magnitude squared of the perpendicular vector is
:&lt;math&gt; |\Delta\mathbf{r}_i^\perp|^2 = (-[S]^2(\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)) \cdot (-[S]^2(\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)) = -\mathbf{S}\cdot[\Delta r_i][\Delta r_i]\mathbf{S}.&lt;/math&gt;
The simplification of this equation uses the identity
:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{S}\times(\mathbf{S}\times(\Delta\mathbf{r}_i))) \cdot \mathbf{S}\times(\mathbf{S}\times(\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)) = (\mathbf{S}\times(\mathbf{S}\times(\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)))\times\mathbf{S}\cdot (\mathbf{S}\times(\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)),&lt;/math&gt;
where the dot and the cross products have been interchanged.  Expand the cross products to compute
:&lt;math&gt; -(\Delta\mathbf{r}_i)\times\mathbf{S}\cdot(\mathbf{S}\times(\Delta\mathbf{r}_i))=-\mathbf{S}\cdot[\Delta r_i][\Delta r_i]\mathbf{S},&lt;/math&gt;
where [Δr{{sub|i}}] is the skew symmetric matrix obtained from the vector Δ'''r'''='''r'''{{sub|i}}-'''R'''.

Thus, the moment of inertia around the line L through '''R''' in the direction '''S''' is obtained from the calculation
:&lt;math&gt; I_L = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i |\Delta\mathbf{r}_i^\perp|^2= -\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \mathbf{S}\cdot[\Delta r_i]^2\mathbf{S},&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;I_L = \mathbf{S}\cdot(-\sum_{i=1}^N m_i [\Delta r_i]^2)\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{S}\cdot[I_R]\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{S}^T[I_R]\mathbf{S},&lt;/math&gt;
where [I{{sub|R}}] is the moment of inertia matrix of the system relative to the reference point '''R'''.

This shows that the inertia matrix can be used to calculate the moment of inertia of a body around any specified rotation axis in the body.

== The inertia tensor ==
The inertia matrix is often described as the inertia tensor, which consists of the same moments of inertia and products of inertia about the three coordinate axes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein&quot;/&gt;  The inertia tensor is constructed from the nine component tensors, (the symbol &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; is the [[tensor product]])
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j,\quad i,j=1,2,3,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''e'''{{sub|i}}, i=1,2,3 are the three orthogonal [[unit vector]]s defining the inertial frame in which the body moves.  Using this basis the inertia tensor is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}=\sum_{i=1}^3\sum_{j=1}^3 I_{ij}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j.&lt;/math&gt;
This tensor is of degree two because the component tensors are each constructed from two basis vectors.  In this form the inertia tensor is also called the ''inertia binor''.

For a rigid system of particles {{math|''P{{sub|k}}'', ''k'' {{=}} 1,...,''N''}} each of mass m{{sub|k}} with position coordinates '''r'''{{sub|k}}=(x{{sub|k}}, y{{sub|k}}, z{{sub|k}}), the inertia tensor is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I} =\sum_{k=1}^Nm_k((\mathbf{r}_k\cdot\mathbf{r}_k)\mathbf{E}-\mathbf{r}_k\otimes\mathbf{r}_k),&lt;/math&gt;
where '''E''' is the identity tensor
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}= \mathbf{e}_1\otimes\mathbf{e}_1+ \mathbf{e}_2\otimes\mathbf{e}_2+\mathbf{e}_3\otimes\mathbf{e}_3.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--In this case, the components of the inertia tensor are given by
: &lt;math&gt;I_{11} = I_{xx} = \sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} (y_{k}^{2}+z_{k}^{2}),\,\! &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{22} = I_{yy} = \sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} (x_{k}^{2}+z_{k}^{2}),\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{33} = I_{zz} =\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} (x_{k}^{2}+y_{k}^{2}),\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{12} = I_{21} =  I_{xy} = -\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} x_{k} y_{k},\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{13} = I_{31} = I_{xz} = -\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} x_{k} z_{k},\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{23} = I_{32} = I_{yz} = -\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} y_{k} z_{k}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;

The inertia tensor for a continuous body is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}=\int_V  \rho(\mathbf{r}) \left( \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r} \right) \mathbf{E} - \mathbf{r}\otimes \mathbf{r}\right)\, dV,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''r''' defines the coordinates of a point in the body and ρ('''r''') is the mass density at that point.  The integral is taken over the volume ''V'' of the body.  The inertia tensor is symmetric because I{{sub|ij}}= I{{sub|ji}}.

Alternatively it can also be written in terms of the [[Hat operator|hat]] operator as:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}=\int_V  \rho(\mathbf{r}) (\hat r)^2 \, dV,&lt;/math&gt;

The inertia tensor can be used in the same way as the inertia matrix to compute the scalar moment of inertia about an arbitrary axis in the direction '''n''',
:&lt;math&gt; I_n = \mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{n},&lt;/math&gt;
where the dot product is taken with the corresponding elements in the component tensors.  A product of inertia term such as I{{sub|12}} is obtained by the computation
:&lt;math&gt;I_{12} = \mathbf{e}_1\cdot\mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{e}_2,&lt;/math&gt;
and can be interpreted as the moment of inertia around the x-axis when the object rotates around the y-axis.

The components of tensors of degree two can be assembled into a matrix.  For the inertia tensor this matrix is given by,
: &lt;math&gt;[I] = \begin{bmatrix}
I_{11} &amp; I_{12} &amp; I_{13} \\
I_{21} &amp; I_{22} &amp; I_{23} \\
I_{31} &amp; I_{32} &amp; I_{33}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
I_{xx} &amp; I_{xy} &amp; I_{xz} \\
I_{yx} &amp; I_{yy} &amp; I_{yz} \\
I_{zx} &amp; I_{zy} &amp; I_{zz}
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
It is common in rigid body mechanics to use notation that explicitly identifies the x, y, and z axes, such as I{{sub|xx}} and I{{sub|xy}}, for the components of the inertia tensor.

===Identities for a skew-symmetric matrix===
To compute moment of inertia of a mass around an axis, the perpendicular vector from the mass to the axis is needed. If the axis L is defined by the unit vector '''S''' through the reference point '''R''', then the perpendicular vector from the line L to the point '''r''' is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\mathbf{r}_i^\perp = (\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R}) - (\mathbf{S}\cdot(\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{R}))\mathbf{S} = [[I]-[\mathbf{S}\mathbf{S}^T]](\Delta\mathbf{r}_i),&lt;/math&gt;
where [I] is the identity matrix and ['''S''' '''S'''{{sup|T}}] is the outer product matrix formed from the unit vector '''S''' along the line L.  Recall that skew-symmetric matrix [S] is constructed so that [S]'''y'''='''S''' x '''y'''.  The matrix [I-SS&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;] in this equation subtracts the component of Δ'''r'''='''r'''-'''R''' that is parallel to '''S'''.

The previous sections show that in computing the moment of inertia matrix this operator yields a similar operator using the components of the vector Δ'''r''' that is
:&lt;math&gt; [I|\Delta\mathbf{r}|^2-\Delta\mathbf{r}\Delta\mathbf{r}^T].&lt;/math&gt;

It is helpful to keep the following identities in mind to compare the equations that define the inertia tensor and the inertia matrix.

Let [R] be the skew symmetric matrix associated with the position vector '''R'''=(x, y, z), then the product in the inertia matrix becomes
:&lt;math&gt; -[R]^2= -\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -z &amp; y \\ z &amp; 0 &amp; -x \\ -y &amp; x &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^2 = \begin{bmatrix}
 y^2+z^2 &amp; -xy &amp; -xz \\ -y x &amp; x^2+z^2 &amp; -yz \\ -zx &amp; -zy &amp; x^2+y^2 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be viewed as another way of computing the perpendicular distance from an axis to a point, because the matrix formed by the outer product ['''R''' '''R'''{{sup|T}}] yields the identify
:&lt;math&gt; -[R]^2 = |\mathbf{R}|^2[I] -[\mathbf{R}\mathbf{R}^T]= 
\begin{bmatrix} x^2+y^2+z^2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\  0&amp; x^2+y^2+z^2 &amp; 0 \\0&amp; 0&amp; x^2+y^2+z^2 \end{bmatrix}- \begin{bmatrix}x^2 &amp; xy &amp; xz \\ yx &amp; y^2 &amp; yz \\ zx &amp; zy &amp; z^2\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
where [I] is the 3x3 identity matrix.

Also notice, that
:&lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{R}|^2 = \mathbf{R}\cdot\mathbf{R} =\operatorname{tr}[\mathbf{R}\mathbf{R}^T],&lt;/math&gt;
where ''tr'' denotes the sum of the diagonal elements of the outer product matrix, known as its trace.

== The inertia matrix in different reference frames ==
The use of the inertia matrix in Newton's second law assumes its components are computed relative to axes parallel to the inertial frame and not relative to a body-fixed reference frame.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstein&quot;/&gt;  This means that as the body moves the components of the inertia matrix change with time.  In contrast, the components of the inertia matrix measured in a body-fixed frame are constant.

===Body frame inertia matrix===
Let the body frame inertia matrix relative to the centre of mass be denoted [I{{sub|C}}{{sup|B}}], and define the orientation of the body frame relative to the inertial frame by the rotation matrix [A], such that,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=[A]\mathbf{y},&lt;/math&gt;
where vectors '''y''' in the body fixed coordinate frame have coordinates '''x''' in the inertial frame.  Then, the inertia matrix of the body measured in the inertial frame is given by
:&lt;math&gt; [I_C]=[A][I_C^B][A^T].&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that [A] changes as the body moves, while [I{{sub|C}}{{sup|B}}] remains constant.

===Principal axes===
Measured in the body frame the inertia matrix is a constant real symmetric matrix.  A real symmetric matrix has the [[eigendecomposition of a matrix|eigendecomposition]] into the product of a rotation matrix [Q] and a diagonal matrix [Λ], given by
:&lt;math&gt;[I_C^B]=[Q][\Lambda][Q^T],&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;[\Lambda]= \begin{bmatrix}
I_{1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; I_{2} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; I_{3}
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The columns of the rotation matrix [Q] define the directions of the principal axes of the body, and the constants I{{sub|1}}, I{{sub|2}} and I{{sub|3}} are called the '''principal moments of inertia'''.   This result was first shown by [[James Joseph Sylvester|J. J. Sylvester (1852)]], and is a form of [[Sylvester's law of inertia]].&lt;ref name=syl852&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

For bodies with constant density an axis of rotational symmetry is a principal axis.

===Inertia of an ellipsoid===
[[File:Triaxial Ellipsoid.jpg|thumb|right|An ellipsoid with the semi-principal diameters labelled a, b, and c.]]
The moment of inertia matrix in body-frame coordinates is a quadratic form that defines a surface in the body called [[Poinsot's ellipsoid]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

|accessdate=November 21, 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Let [Λ] be the inertia matrix relative to the centre of mass aligned with the principal axes, then the surface
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}^T[\Lambda]\mathbf{x}=1,&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; I_1x^2 + I_2y^2 + I_3z^2 =1,&lt;/math&gt;
defines an [[ellipsoid]] in the body frame.  Write this equation in the form,
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{x^2}{(1/\sqrt{I_1})^2} + \frac{y^2}{(1/\sqrt{I_2})^2} + \frac{z^2}{(1/\sqrt{I_3})^2} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
to see that the semi-principal diameters of this ellipsoid are given by
:&lt;math&gt; a=\frac{1}{\sqrt{I_1}}, \quad b=\frac{1}{\sqrt{I_2}}, \quad c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{I_3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let a point '''x''' on this ellipsoid be defined in terms of its magnitude and direction, '''x'''=|'''x'''|'''n''', where '''n''' is a unit vector.  Then the relationship presented above, between the inertia matrix and the scalar moment of inertia I{{sub|n}} around an axis in the direction '''n''', yields
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}^T[\Lambda]\mathbf{x}=|\mathbf{x}|^2\mathbf{n}^T[\Lambda]\mathbf{n} = |\mathbf{x}|^2I_n = 1. &lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the magnitude of a point '''x''' in the direction '''n''' on the inertia ellipsoid is
:&lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{x}| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{I_n}}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!---duplicated above
===Parallel axis theorem for the inertia matrix===
{{Main|Parallel axis theorem}}
It is useful to note here that if the moment of inertia matrix or tensor is relative to the [[centre of mass]], then it can be determined relative to any other reference point in the body using the parallel axis theorem.  If [I{{sub|C}}{{sup|B}}] is the moment of inertia matrix in the body frame relative to the centre of mass '''C''', then the moment of inertia matrix [I{{sub|R}}{{sup|B}}] in the same frame but relative to a different point '''R''' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;[I_R^B] = [I_C^B] - M[d]^2, &lt;/math&gt;
where M is the mass of the body, and [d] is the skew-symmetric matrix obtained from the vector '''d'''= '''R'''-'''C'''.

The tensor form of the parallel axis theorem is given by
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{I}_R^B = \mathbf{I}_C^B + M((\mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{d}) \mathbf{E} - \mathbf{d} \otimes \mathbf{d}).
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6330">In [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] and [[geography]], '''number density''' (symbol: ''n'' or ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) is an [[intensive quantity]] used to describe the degree of [[concentration]] of [[countable]] objects ([[Elementary particle|particle]]s, [[molecules]], [[phonon]]s, [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]], etc.) in physical space: [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] volume number density, [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] area number density, or [[One-dimensional space|one-dimensional]] line number density. [[Population density]] is an example of areal number density. The term '''number concentration''' (symbol: ''C'', to avoid confusion with [[amount of substance]] ''n'') is sometimes used in chemistry for the same quantity, particularly when comparing with other concentrations.

==Definition==
Volume number density is the number of specified objects per unit [[volume]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | file = N04260 | title = number concentration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{N}{V},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''N'' is the total number of objects in a volume ''V''. 

Here it is assumed&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Units==
In [[International System of Units|SI]] units, number density is measured in m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, although cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; is often used. However, these units are not quite practical when dealing with atoms or molecules of [[gas]]es, [[liquid]]s or [[solid]]s at [[room temperature]] and [[atmospheric pressure]], because the resulting numbers are extremely large (on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;). Using the number density of an [[ideal gas]] at {{nobreak|0 [[Celsius|°C]]}} and {{nobreak|1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]}} as a [[yardstick]]: {{nobreak|1=[[Loschmidt constant|n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] = 1 [[Amagat|amg]] = 2.686,777,4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is often introduced as a unit of number density, for any substances at any conditions (not necessarily limited to an ideal gas at {{nobreak|0 °C}} and {{nobreak|1 atm}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Usage==
Using the number density as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of [[Coordinate system|spatial coordinates]], the total number of objects ''N'' in the entire volume ''V'' can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;N = \iiint_V n(x,\,y,\,z)\,\mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;
where d''V'' = d''x'' d''y'' d''z'' is a volume element. If each object possesses the same [[mass]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the total mass ''m'' of all the objects in the volume ''V'' can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;m = \iiint_V m_0 n(x,\,y,\,z)\,\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar expressions are valid for [[electric charge]] or any other [[extensive quantity]] associated with countable objects. For example, replacing ''m'' with ''q'' (total charge) and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (charge of each object) in the above equation will lead to a correct expression for charge.

The number density of [[solution|solute]] molecules in a [[solvent]] is sometimes called [[concentration]], although usually concentration is expressed as a number of [[Mole (unit)|moles]] per unit volume (and thus called [[molar concentration]]).

==Relation to other quantities==
===Molar concentration===
For any substance, the number density can be expressed in terms of its [[amount concentration]] ''c'' (in [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) as
:&lt;math&gt;n = \mathrm{N_A}c,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{nobreak|N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Avogadro constant]]. This is still true if the [[spatial dimension]] unit, metre, in both ''n'' and ''c'' is consistently replaced by any other spatial dimension unit, e.g. if ''n'' is in cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c'' is in mol/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or if ''n'' is in [[Litre|L]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c'' is in mol/L, etc.

===Mass density===
For [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s of a well-defined [[molar mass]] ''M'' (in [[Kilogram|kg]]/mol), the number density can be expressed in terms of their [[mass density]] ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) as
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{\mathrm{N_A}}{M} \rho_\mathrm{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the ratio ''M''/N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of a single atom or molecule in kg.

The '''particle number''' (or '''number of particles''') of a [[thermodynamic system]], popconventionally indicated with the letter ''N'', is the number of constituent particles in that system.&lt;ref name=&quot;HoP&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benenson|first1=Walter|last2=Harris|first2=John|last3=Stöcker|first3=Horst|title=Handbook of Physics |url=http://books.google.com/?id=c60mCxGRMR8C&amp;pg=PA637&amp;dq=%22Particle+number%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Particle%20number%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-95269-1|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The particle number is a fundamental parameter in [[thermodynamics]] which is [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] to the [[chemical potential]]. Unlike most [[physical quantities]], particle number is a [[dimensionless quantity]]. It is an [[extensive parameter]], as it is directly proportional to the size of the system under consideration, and thus meaningful only for [[Thermodynamic system#Closed system|closed system]]s.

A '''constituent particle''' is one that cannot be broken into smaller pieces at the scale of [[energy]] ''k·T'' involved in the process (where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' is the [[temperature]]). For example, for a thermodynamic system consisting of a [[piston]] containing water vapour, the particle number is the number of water molecules in the system. The meaning of constituent particle, and thereby of particle number, is thus temperature-dependent.

==Determining the particle number==
The concept of particle number has a main role in [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] considerations. In situations where the actual particle number of a given thermodynamical system needs to be determined, mainly in [[chemistry]], it is not practically possible to measure it directly by counting the particles. If the material is homogeneous and has a known [[amount of substance]] ''n'' expressed in [[mole (unit)|mole]]s, the particle number ''N'' can be found by the relation
:''N'' = ''nN&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'',
where ''N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Avogadro constant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HoP&quot;/&gt;

==Particle number density==
A related [[intensive parameter|intensive system parameter]] is given by the '''particle [[number density]]''', obtained by dividing the particle number of a system by its [[volume]]. This parameter is often denoted by a lower-case letter ''n''.

==In quantum mechanics==
In [[quantum mechanical]] processes the total number of particles may not be preserved. The concept is therefore generalized to the [[particle number operator]], that is, the [[observable]] that counts the number of constituent particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schumacher|first1=Benjamin|last2=Westmoreland|first2=Michael|title=Quantum Processes, Systems, and Information |year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[quantum field theory]], the particle number operator (see [[Fock state]]) is conjugate to the phase of the ''classical'' wave (see [[coherent state]]).

==In air quality==
One measure of [[air pollution]] used in air quality standards is the atmospheric concentration of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]]. This measure is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;particle number&quot;, although it is usually expressed in μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ([[micrograms]] per cubic metre).

The '''propagation constant''' of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is a measure of the change undergone by the amplitude of the wave as it [[wave propagation|propagates]] in a given direction.  The quantity being measured can be the [[voltage]] or [[electric current|current]] in a circuit or a field vector such as [[electric field strength]] or [[flux density]].  The propagation constant itself measures change per unit length but is otherwise dimensionless. In the context of [[Two port networks|two-port networks]] and their cascades, '''propagation constant '''measures the change undergone by the source quantity as it propagates from one port to the next.

The propagation constant is expressed logarithmically, almost universally to the base e, rather than the more usual base 10 used in [[telecommunication]]s in other situations.  The quantity measured, such as voltage, is expressed as a sinusoidal [[phasor]].  The phase of the sinusoid varies with distance which results in the propagation constant being a [[complex number]], the [[imaginary number|imaginary]] part being caused by the phase change.

__TOC__

==Alternative names==

The term propagation constant is somewhat of a misnomer as it usually varies strongly with ''ω''.  It is probably the most widely used term but there are a large variety of alternative names used by various authors for this quantity.  These include, '''transmission parameter''', '''transmission function''', '''propagation parameter''', '''propagation coefficient''' and '''transmission constant'''.  In plural, it is usually implied that ''α'' and ''β'' are being referenced separately but collectively as in '''transmission parameters''', '''propagation parameters''', '''propagation coefficients''', '''transmission constants''' and '''secondary coefficients'''.  This last occurs in transmission line theory, the term ''secondary'' being used to contrast to the ''[[primary line coefficients]]''.  The primary coefficients being the physical properties of the line; R,C,L and G, from which the secondary coefficients may be derived using the [[telegrapher's equation]].  Note that, at least in the field of transmission lines, the term [[transmission coefficient]] has a different meaning despite the similarity of name.  Here it is the corollary of [[reflection coefficient]].

==Definition==

The propagation constant, symbol γ, for a given system is defined by the ratio of the amplitude at the source of the wave to the amplitude at some distance ''x'', such that,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A_0}{A_x}=e^{\gamma x}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the propagation constant is a complex quantity we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \alpha +i \beta \,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&amp;alpha;, the real part, is called the [[#Attenuation constant|attenuation constant]]
:&amp;beta;, the imaginary part, is called the [[#Phase constant|phase constant]]

That β does indeed represent phase can be seen from [[Euler's formula]];

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta}=\cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is a sinusoid which varies in phase as θ varies but does not vary in amplitude because;

:&lt;math&gt;\left|e^{i\theta}\right|=\sqrt{\cos^2{\theta}+\sin^2{\theta}}=1&lt;/math&gt;

The reason for the use of base e is also now made clear.  The imaginary phase constant, iβ, can be added directly to the attenuation constant, α, to form a single complex number that can be handled in one mathematical operation provided they are to the same base.  Angles measured in radians require base e, so the attenuation is likewise in base e.

The propagation constant for copper (or any other conductor) lines can be calculated from the primary line coefficients by means of the relationship;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\sqrt{ZY}&lt;/math&gt;

where;

:&lt;math&gt;Z=R+i\omega L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the series [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the line per unit length and,

:&lt;math&gt;Y=G+i\omega C\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the shunt [[admittance]] of the line per unit length.

==Attenuation constant==

In [[telecommunication]]s, the term '''attenuation constant''', also called '''attenuation parameter''' or '''[[attenuation coefficient]]''', is the attenuation of an electromagnetic wave propagating through a [[Transmission medium|medium]] per unit distance from the source. It is the real part of the propagation constant and is measured in [[neper]]s per metre.  A neper is approximately 8.7[[decibel|dB]].  Attenuation constant can be defined by the amplitude ratio;

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\frac{A_0}{A_x}\right|=e^{\alpha x}&lt;/math&gt;

The propagation constant per unit length is defined as the natural logarithmic of ratio of the sending end current or voltage to the receiving end current or voltage.

===Copper lines===

The attenuation constant for copper lines (or ones made of any other conductor) can be calculated from the primary line coefficients as shown above.  For a line meeting the [[Heaviside condition|distortionless condition]], with a conductance G in the insulator, the attenuation constant is given by;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\sqrt{RG}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

however, a real line is unlikely to meet this condition without the addition of [[loading coils]] and, furthermore, there are some frequency dependent effects operating on the primary &quot;constants&quot; which cause a frequency dependence of the loss.  There are two main components to these losses, the metal loss and the dielectric loss.

The loss of most transmission lines are dominated by the metal loss, which causes a frequency dependency due to finite conductivity of metals, and the [[skin effect]] inside a conductor. The skin effect causes R along the conductor to be approximately dependent on frequency according to;

:&lt;math&gt;R \propto \sqrt{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

Losses in the dielectric depend on the [[loss tangent]] (&lt;math&gt;{\tan \delta}&lt;/math&gt;) of the material, which depends inversely on the wavelength of the signal and is directly proportional to the frequency.

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_d={{\pi}\sqrt{\varepsilon_r}\over{\lambda}}{\tan \delta}&lt;/math&gt;

===Optical fibre===

The attenuation constant for a particular [[propagation mode]] in an [[optical fiber]], the real part of the [[axial propagation constant]].

==Phase constant==
In [[electromagnetic theory]], the '''phase constant''', also called '''phase change constant''', '''parameter''' or '''coefficient''' is the imaginary component of the propagation constant for a plane wave.  It represents the change in phase per unit length along the path travelled by the wave at any instant and is equal to [[real part]] of the [[wavenumber#In wave equations|angular wavenumber]] of the wave.  It is represented by the symbol β and is measured in units of radians per unit metre.

From the definition of (angular) wavenumber;

:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} = \beta&lt;/math&gt;

For a [[transmission line]], the [[Heaviside condition]] of the [[telegrapher's equation]] tells us that the wavenumber must be proportional to frequency for the transmission of the wave to be undistorted in the [[time domain]].  This includes, but is not limited to, the ideal case of a lossless line.  The reason for this condition can be seen by considering that a useful signal is composed of many different wavelengths in the frequency domain.  For there to be no distortion of the [[waveform]], all these waves must travel at the same velocity so that they arrive at the far end of the line at the same time as a [[group velocity|group]].  Since wave [[phase velocity]] is given by;

:&lt;math&gt;v_p=\frac{\lambda}{T}=\frac{f}{\tilde{\nu}}=\frac{\omega}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

it is proved that β is required to be proportional to ω. In terms of primary coefficients of the line, this yields from the telegrapher's equation for a distortionless line the condition;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \omega \sqrt{LC}&lt;/math&gt;

However, practical lines can only be expected to approximately meet this condition over a limited frequency band.

==Filters and two-port networks==
The term propagation constant or propagation function is applied to [[Electronic filters|filters]] and other [[two-port network]]s used for [[signal processing]].  In these cases, however, the attenuation and phase coefficients are expressed in terms of nepers and radians per [[Electronic filter topology#Passive topologies|network section]] rather than per unit length.  Some authors&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei et al, p49&lt;/ref&gt; make a distinction between per unit length measures (for which &quot;constant&quot; is used) and per section measures (for which &quot;function&quot; is used).

The propagation constant is a useful concept in filter design which invariably uses a cascaded section [[Electronic filter topology|topology]].  In a cascaded topology, the propagation constant, attenuation constant and phase constant of individual sections may be simply added to find the total propagation constant etc.

===Cascaded networks===
[[Image:Adding propagation constant of filters.svg|center|thumb|750px|Three networks with arbitrary propagation constants and impedances connected in cascade.  The Z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; terms represent [[image impedance]] and it is assumed that connections are between matching image impedances.]]

The ratio of output to input voltage for each network is given by,&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei et al pp51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{V_2}=\sqrt{\frac{Z_{I1}}{Z_{I2}}}e^{\gamma_1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_2}{V_3}=\sqrt{\frac{Z_{I2}}{Z_{I3}}}e^{\gamma_2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_3}{V_4}=\sqrt{\frac{Z_{I3}}{Z_{I4}}}e^{\gamma_3}&lt;/math&gt;

The terms &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{Z_{In}}{Z_{Im}}}&lt;/math&gt; are impedance scaling terms&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei et al pp37-38&lt;/ref&gt; and their use is explained in the [[Image impedance#Transfer function|image impedance]] article.

The overall voltage ratio is given by,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{V_4}=\frac{V_1}{V_2}\cdot\frac{V_2}{V_3}\cdot\frac{V_3}{V_4}=\sqrt{\frac{Z_{I1}}{Z_{I4}}}e^{\gamma_1+\gamma_2+\gamma_3}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus for ''n'' cascaded sections all having matching impedances facing each other, the overall propagation constant is given by,

&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{Tot}=\gamma_1 + \gamma_2 + \gamma_3 + \cdots + \gamma_n&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Quantum efficiency graph for WFPC2-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|A graph showing variation of quantum efficiency with wavelength of a CCD chip in the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]].]]
The term '''quantum efficiency (QE)''' may apply to '''incident photon to converted electron (IPCE) ratio''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Sean|title=2.5% efficient organic plastic solar cells|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=2001|volume=78|issue=6|doi=10.1063/1.1345834|url=http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v78/i6/p841_s1?bypassSSO=1|accessdate=20 May 2012|bibcode = 2001ApPhL..78..841S }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[photosensitivity|photosensitive device]] or it may refer to the [[Tunnel magnetoresistance|TMR effect]] of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction.

This article deals with the term as a measurement of a device's electrical sensitivity to light. In a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) it is the percentage of [[photon]]s hitting the device's photoreactive surface that produce [[charge carrier]]s. It is measured in [[electron]]s per photon or [[ampere|amps]] per [[watt]]. Since the energy of a photon is [[proportionality (mathematics)#Inversely proportional|inversely proportional]] to its [[wavelength]], QE is often measured over a range of different wavelengths to characterize a device's [[efficiency]] at each photon energy level. The QE for photons with energy below the [[band gap]] is zero. Photographic film typically has a QE of much less than 10%,&lt;ref name=Trager200&gt;{{cite book|last=Träger|first=Frank|title=Handbook of Lasers and Optics|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642194092|pages=601|pages=603|url=http://books.google.pl/books?id=Ad5G1HWtDRgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA603#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; while CCDs can have a QE of well over 90% at some wavelengths.

==Quantum efficiency of solar cells==
[[Image:Solarcellige-en.svg|thumb|right|400px|A graph showing variation of internal quantum efficiency, external quantum efficiency, and reflectance with wavelength of a crystalline silicon solar cell.]]

A [[Quantum efficiency of a solar cell|solar cell's quantum efficiency]] value indicates the amount of current that the cell will produce when irradiated by photons of a particular wavelength. If the cell's quantum efficiency is [[integral|integrated]] over the whole [[sunlight|solar electromagnetic spectrum]], one can evaluate the amount of current that the cell will produce when exposed to sunlight. The ratio between this energy-production value and the highest possible energy-production value for the cell (i.e., if the QE were 100% over the whole spectrum) gives the cell's overall [[solar cell efficiency|energy conversion efficiency]] value. Note that in the event of [[multiple exciton generation]] (MEG), quantum efficiencies of greater than 100% may be achieved since the incident photons have more than twice the [[band gap]] energy and can create two or more electron-hole pairs per incident photon.

===Types of quantum efficiency===
Two types of quantum efficiency of a solar cell are often considered:

*'''External Quantum Efficiency (EQE)''' is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy ''shining on the solar cell from outside'' (incident photons).
*'''Internal Quantum Efficiency (IQE)''' is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy that shine on the solar cell from outside ''and'' are absorbed by the cell.

The IQE is always larger than the EQE. A low IQE indicates that the active layer of the solar cell is unable to make good use of the photons. To measure the IQE, one first measures the EQE of the solar device, then measures its transmission and reflection, and combines these data to infer the IQE.

:&lt;math&gt; \text{EQE} = \frac{\text{electrons/sec}}{\text{photons/sec}}= \frac{\text{current}/\text{(charge of one electron)}}{(\text{total power of photons})/(\text{energy of one photon})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{IQE} = 
\frac{\text{electrons/sec}}{\text{absorbed photons/sec}}= 
\frac{\text{EQE}}{\text{1-Reflection-Transmission}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The external quantum efficiency therefore depends on both the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of light and the collection of charges. Once a photon has been absorbed and has generated an electron-hole pair, these charges must be separated and collected at the junction. A &quot;good&quot; material avoids charge recombination. Charge recombination causes a drop in the external quantum efficiency.

The ideal quantum efficiency graph has a [[Boxcar function|square shape]], where the QE value is fairly constant across the entire spectrum of wavelengths measured. However, the QE for most solar cells is reduced because of the effects of recombination, where charge carriers are not able to move into an external circuit. The same mechanisms that affect the collection probability also affect the QE. For example, modifying the front surface can affect carriers generated near the surface. And because high-energy (blue) light is absorbed very close to the surface, considerable recombination at the front surface will affect the &quot;blue&quot; portion of the QE. Similarly, lower energy (green) light is absorbed in the bulk of a solar cell, and a low diffusion length will affect the collection probability from the solar cell bulk, reducing the QE in the green portion of the spectrum. Generally, solar cells on the market today do not produce much electricity from [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]] light (&lt;400&amp;nbsp;nm and &gt;1100&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths, respectively); these wavelengths of light are either filtered out or are absorbed by the cell, thus heating the cell. That heat is wasted energy, and could damage the cell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/08/21/silicon-nanoparticle-film-can-increase-solar-cell-performance/ Silicon nanoparticle film can increase solar cell performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quantum efficiency of Image Sensors''' :
Quantum efficiency (QE) is the fraction of photon flux that contributes to the photocurrent in a photodetector or
a pixel. Quantum efficiency is one of the most important parameters used to evaluate the quality of a detector and is often called the spectral response to reflect its wavelength dependence. It is defined as the number of signal electrons created per incident photon. In some cases it can exceed 100% (i.e. when more than one electron is created per incident photon).

'''EQE mapping''' :
Conventional measurement of the EQE will give the efficiency of the overall device. However it is often useful to have a map of the EQE over large area of the device. This mapping provides an efficient way to visualize the homogeneity and/or the defects in the sample. It was realized by researchers from the Institute of Researcher and Development on Photovoltaic Energy (IRDEP) who calculated the EQE mapping from electroluminescence measurements taken with an [[hyperspectral]] imager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Delamarre |display-authors=etal  |title=Evaluation of micrometer scale lateral fluctuations of transport properties in CIGS solar cells |journal=Proc. Of SPIE  |volume=100 |date=2013 | doi=10.1117/12.2004323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Delamarre |display-authors=etal |title=Quantitative luminescence mapping of Cu(In,Ga)Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin-film solar cells |journal=Progress in Photovoltaics |date=2014 | doi=10.1002/pip.2555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectral responsivity==
[[responsivity|Spectral responsivity]] is a similar measurement, but it has different units: [[ampere]]s per [[watt]] (A/W); (i.e. how much [[electric current|current]] comes out of the device per incoming photon of a given energy and wavelength). Both the quantum efficiency and the responsivity are functions of the photons' wavelength (indicated by the subscript λ).

To convert from responsivity (''R&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'', in A/W) to QE&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rogalski, K. Adamiec and J. Rutkowski, ''Narrow-Gap Semiconductor Photodiodes'', SPIE Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; (on a scale 0 to 1):

:&lt;math&gt;QE_\lambda=\frac{R_\lambda}{\lambda}\times\frac{h c}{e}\approx\frac{R_\lambda}{\lambda} {\times} (1240\;{\rm W}\cdot {\rm nm/A})  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ'' is the wavelength in [[nanometre|nm]], ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, and ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]].

===Determination===
:&lt;math&gt;QE_\lambda=\eta =\frac{N_e}{N_\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_e&lt;/math&gt; = number of electrons produced, &lt;math&gt;N_\nu&lt;/math&gt; = number of photons absorbed.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_\nu}t = \Phi_o \frac{\lambda}{hc}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming each photon absorbed in the depletion layer produces a viable electron-hole pair, and all other photons do not,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_e}t = \Phi_{\xi}\frac{\lambda}{hc}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the measurement time (in seconds), 
&lt;math&gt;\Phi_o&lt;/math&gt; = incident optical power in watts, 
&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\xi}&lt;/math&gt; = optical power absorbed in depletion layer, also in watts.

In [[radiometry]], '''radiance''' is the [[radiant flux]] emitted, reflected, transmitted or received by a ''surface'', per unit [[solid angle]] per unit ''projected'' area, and '''spectral radiance''' is the radiance of a ''surface'' per unit [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]], depending on whether the [[Spectral radiometric quantity|spectrum]] is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. These are ''directional'' quantities. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of radiance is the [[watt]] per [[steradian]] per [[square metre]] ({{nobreak|W·sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), while that of spectral radiance in frequency is the watt per steradian per square metre per [[hertz]] ({{nobreak|W·sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and that of spectral radiance in wavelength is the watt per steradian per square metre, per metre ({{nobreak|W·sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}})—commonly the watt per steradian per square metre per nanometre ({{nobreak|W·sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·nm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}). The [[microflick]] is also used to measure spectral radiance in some fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=James M.|title=The SI system and SI units for Radiometry and photometry|url=http://www.optics.arizona.edu/palmer/opti400/suppdocs/bkappndx.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802170633/http://www.optics.arizona.edu/palmer/opti400/suppdocs/bkappndx.pdf|archivedate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowlett|first=Russ|title=How Many? A Dictionary of Units of Measurement|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictF.html#flick|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiance is used to characterize diffuse emission and [[diffuse reflection|reflection]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]], or to quantify emission of [[neutrino]]s and other particles. Historically, radiance is called &quot;intensity&quot; and spectral radiance is called &quot;specific intensity&quot;. Many fields still use this nomenclature. It is especially dominant in [[heat transfer]], [[astrophysics]] and [[astronomy]]. &quot;Intensity&quot; has many other meanings in [[physics]], with the most common being [[intensity (physics)|power per unit area]].

==Description==
Radiance is useful because it indicates how much of the power emitted, reflected, transmitted or received by a surface will be received by an optical system looking at that surface from some angle of view. In this case, the solid angle of interest is the solid angle subtended by the optical system's [[entrance pupil]]. Since the [[human eye|eye]] is an optical system, radiance and its cousin [[luminance]] are good indicators of how bright an object will appear. For this reason, radiance and luminance are both sometimes called &quot;brightness&quot;. This usage is now discouraged (see the article [[Brightness]] for a discussion). The nonstandard usage of &quot;brightness&quot; for &quot;radiance&quot; persists in some fields, notably [[laser physics]].

The radiance divided by the index of refraction squared is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] in [[geometric optics]]. This means that for an ideal optical system in air, the radiance at the output is the same as the input radiance. This is sometimes called ''conservation of radiance''. For real, passive, optical systems, the output radiance is ''at most'' equal to the input, unless the index of refraction changes. As an example, if you form a demagnified image with a lens, the optical power is concentrated into a smaller area, so the [[irradiance]] is higher at the image. The light at the image plane, however, fills a larger solid angle so the radiance comes out to be the same assuming there is no loss at the lens.

Spectral radiance expresses radiance as a function of frequency or wavelength. Radiance is the integral of the spectral radiance over all frequencies or wavelengths. For radiation emitted by an ideal [[black body]] at a given temperature, spectral radiance is governed by [[Planck's law]], while the integral of radiance over the hemisphere into which it radiates, is governed by the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]. There is no need for a separate law for the radiance of a black body, since this is simply the Stefan–Boltzmann law divided by π. This factor is obtained from the solid angle 2π steradians of a hemisphere decreased by [[Stefan–Boltzmann law#Integration of intensity derivation|integration over the cosine of the zenith angle]]. A black body being [[Lambert's cosine law|Lambertian]], its radiance does not depend on the zenith angle.

==Mathematical definitions==
===Radiance===
'''Radiance''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω&lt;/sub&gt; (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with photometric quantities, and &quot;Ω&quot; to indicate this is a directional quantity), is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16943|title=Thermal insulation — Heat transfer by radiation — Physical quantities and definitions|work=ISO 9288:1989|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] catalogue|year=1989|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega} = \frac{\partial^2 \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \Omega\, \partial A \cos \theta},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*∂ is the [[partial derivative]] symbol;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received;
*''Ω'' is the solid angle;
*''A'' cos ''θ'' is the ''projected'' area.

In general ''L''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω&lt;/sub&gt; is a function of viewing direction, depending on ''θ'' through cos ''θ'' and [[azimuth angle]] through {{nobreak|∂Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;/∂''Ω''}}. For the special case of a [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian surface]], {{nobreak|∂&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;/(∂''Ω'' ∂''A'')}} is proportional to cos ''θ'', and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω&lt;/sub&gt; is isotropic (independent of viewing direction).

When calculating the radiance emitted by a source, ''A'' refers to an area on the surface of the source, and ''Ω'' to the solid angle into which the light is emitted. When calculating radiance received by a detector, ''A'' refers to an area on the surface of the detector and ''Ω'' to the solid angle subtended by the source as viewed from that detector. When radiance is conserved, as discussed above, the radiance emitted by a source is the same as that received by a detector observing it.

===Spectral radiance===
'''Spectral radiance in frequency''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω,ν&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega,\nu} = \frac{\partial L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega}}{\partial \nu},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ν'' is the frequency.

'''Spectral radiance in wavelength''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω,λ&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega,\lambda} = \frac{\partial L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega}}{\partial \lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' is the wavelength.

==Conservation of basic radiance==
Radiance of a surface is related to [[étendue]] by
:&lt;math&gt;L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega} = n^2 \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial G},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''n'' is the [[refractive index]] in which that surface is immersed;
*''G'' is the étendue of the light beam.

As the light travels through an ideal optical system, both the étendue and the radiant flux are conserved. Therefore, ''basic radiance'' defined by&lt;ref&gt;William Ross McCluney, ''Introduction to Radiometry and Photometry'', Artech House, Boston, MA, 1994 [ISBN 978-0890066782]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega}^* = \frac{L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega}}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
is also conserved. In real systems, the étendue may increase (for example due to scattering) or the radiant flux may decrease (for example due to absorption) and, therefore, basic radiance may decrease. However, étendue may not decrease and radiant flux may not increase and, therefore, basic radiance may not increase.

The '''relative velocity''' &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_\mathrm{B|A}&lt;/math&gt; (also &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_\mathrm{BA}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_\mathrm{B rel A}&lt;/math&gt;) is the velocity of an object or observer '''B''' in the rest frame of another object or observer '''A'''.

==Classical mechanics==

===In one dimension (non-relativistic)===
[[File:Relative motion man on train.gif|360px|thumb|Relative motion man on train]]
We begin with relative motion in the [[classical mechanics|classical]], (or non-[[Introduction to special relativity|relativistic]], or  the [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian approximation]]) that all speeds are much less than the speed of light.  This limit is associated with the [[Galilean transformation]].  The figure shows a man on top of a train, at the back edge.  At 1:00 pm he begins to walk forward at a walking speed of 10&amp;nbsp;km/hr (kilometers per hour).  The train is moving at 40&amp;nbsp;km/hr.  The figure depicts the man and train at two different times: first, when the journey began, and also one hour later at 2:00 pm.  The figure suggests that the man is 50&amp;nbsp;km from the starting point after having traveled (by walking and by train) for one hour.  This, by definition, is 50&amp;nbsp;km/hour, which suggests that the prescription for calculating relative velocity in this fashion is to add the two velocities.

The figure displays clocks and rulers to remind the reader that while the logic behind this calculation seem flawless, it makes false assumptions about how clocks and rulers behave.  (See [[Relativity of simultaneity#The train-and-platform thought experiment|The train-and-platform thought experiment]].) To recognize that this [[classical mechanics|classical]] model of relative motion violates [[special relativity]], we generalize the example into an equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{\vec v_{M|E}}_{50\;km/hr}=\underbrace{\vec v_{M|T}}_{10\;km/hr}+\underbrace{\vec v_{T|E}}_{40\;km/hr}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
:''where:''
::&lt;math&gt;\vec v_{M|E}&lt;/math&gt; ''is the velocity of the '''M'''an relative to '''E'''arth.''
::&lt;math&gt;\vec v_{M|T}&lt;/math&gt; ''is the velocity of the '''M'''an relative to the '''T'''rain.''
::&lt;math&gt;\vec v_{T|E}&lt;/math&gt; ''is the velocity of the '''T'''rain relative to '''E'''arth.''

Fully legitimate expressions for &quot;''the velocity of A relative to B''&quot; include &quot;''the velocity of A with respect to B''&quot; and &quot;''the velocity of A in the coordinate system where B is always at rest''&quot;.  The [[Postulates of special relativity|violation of special relativity]] occurs because this equation for relative velocity falsely predicts that different observers will measure different speeds when observing the motion of light.  &lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, replace the &quot;Man&quot; by a photon traveling at the speed of light.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In two dimensions (non-relativistic)===
[[File:Relative velocity.svg|300px|thumb|Relative velocities between two particles in classical mechanics.]]
The figure shows two objects (A and B) moving at constant velocity.  The equations of motion are:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec r_A=\vec r_{Ai}+\vec v_A t&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\vec r_B=\vec r_{Bi}+ \vec v_B t&lt;/math&gt;,

where the subscript ''i'' refers to the initial displacement (at time ''t'' equal to zero).  The difference between the two displacement vectors, &lt;math&gt;\vec r_B-\vec r_A&lt;/math&gt;, represents the location of B as seen from A.

:&lt;math&gt;\vec r_B-\vec r_A= \underbrace{\vec r_{Bi}-\vec r_{Ai}}_{initial\;separation} + \underbrace{(\vec v_B-\vec v_A ) t}_{relative\;velocity}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec v_{B|A}=\vec v_{B}-\vec v_{A}&lt;/math&gt;
After making the substitutions,
&lt;math&gt;\vec v_{A|C}=\vec v_A&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\vec v_{B|C}=\vec v_B&lt;/math&gt;,
we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec v_{B|A} = \vec v_{B|C}-\vec v_{A|C} \Rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\vec v_{B|C}=\vec v_{B|A} +\vec v_{A|C}&lt;/math&gt;
Though easy to learn, this notation is unfortunately a bit cumbersome for lengthy calculations.

===Galilean transformation (non-relativistic)===
To construct a theory of relative motion consistent with the theory of special relativity, we must adopt a different convention. Continuing to work in the (non-relativistic)  [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian limit]] we begin with a [[Galilean transformation]] in one dimension:&lt;ref group=note&gt;This result is valid if all motion is restricted to the x-axis, but can be easily generalized by replacing the first equation by &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}\,'=\vec{r}-\vec{v}t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x'=x-vt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t'=t&lt;/math&gt;
where x' is the position as seen by a reference frame that is moving at speed, v, in the &quot;unprimed&quot; (x) reference frame.&lt;ref group=note&gt;It is easy to be confused about the minus sign before ''v'', or whether ''v'' is defined in the prime or unprimed reference frame.  It might help to visualize the fact that if ''x=vt'', then ''x'=0'', meaning that a particle that is following the path   ''x=vt'' is at rest in the primed reference frame.&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking the differential of the first of the two equations above, we have, &lt;math&gt;dx'=dx-vdt&lt;/math&gt;, and what may seem like the obvious&lt;ref group=note&gt;Keep in mind that, due to [[time dilation]], dt=dt' is valid only in the approximation that the speed is much less than that of light.&lt;/ref&gt; statement that &lt;math&gt;dt'=dt&lt;/math&gt;, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx'}{dt'}=\frac{dx}{dt}-v&lt;/math&gt;
To recover the previous expressions for relative velocity, we assume that particle ''A'' is following the path defined by dx/dt in the unprimed reference (and hence dx'/dt' in the primed frame).  Thus &lt;math&gt;dx/dt = v_{A|O}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dx'/dt = v_{A|O'}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O'&lt;/math&gt; refer to motion of ''A'' as seen by an observer in the unprimed and primed frame, respectively.  Recall that v is the motion of a stationary object in the primed frame, as seen from the unprimed frame.  Thus we have &lt;math&gt;v=v_{O'|O}&lt;/math&gt;, and:
:&lt;math&gt; v_{A|O'}= v_{A|O}-v_{O'|O}\Rightarrow v_{A|O} = v_{A|O'} + v_{O'|O}&lt;/math&gt;,

where the latter form has the desired (easily learned) symmetry.

==Special Relativity==
As in classical mechanics, in Special Relativity the relative velocity &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_\mathrm{B|A}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of an object or observer '''B''' in the rest frame of another object or observer '''A'''. However, unlike the case of classical mechanics, in Special Relativity, it is generally '''not''' the case that
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_\mathrm{B|A}=-\vec{v}_\mathrm{A|B}&lt;/math&gt;

This peculiar lack of symmetry is related to [[Thomas precession]] and the fact that two successive Lorentz transformations rotate the coordinate system.  This rotation has no effect on the magnitude of a vector, and hence relative [[speed]] is symmetrical.

:&lt;math&gt;\|\vec{v}_\mathrm{B|A}\|=\|\vec{v}_\mathrm{A|B}\|=v_\mathrm{B|A}=v_\mathrm{A|B}&lt;/math&gt;

===Parallel Velocities===

In the case where two objects are traveling in parallel directions, the relativistic formula for relative velocity is similar in form to the formula for addition of relativistic velocities.

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_\mathrm{B|A}=\frac{\vec{v}_\mathrm{B}-\vec{v}_\mathrm{A}}{1-\frac{\vec{v}_\mathrm{A}\vec{v}_\mathrm{B}}{c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The relative '''speed''' is given by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{B|A}=\frac{\left | v_\mathrm{B}-v_\mathrm{A}\right | }{1-\frac{v_\mathrm{A}v_\mathrm{B}}{c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Perpendicular Velocities===

In the case where two objects are traveling in perpendicular directions, the relativistic relative velocity &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_\mathrm{B|A}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_\mathrm{B|A}={\frac{\vec{v}_\mathrm{B}}{\gamma_\mathrm{A}}}-\vec{v}_\mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_\mathrm{A}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(\frac{v_\mathrm{A}}{c})^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The relative speed is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{B|A}=\frac{\sqrt{c^4 -(c^2-v_\mathrm{A}^2)(c^2 -v_\mathrm{B}^2)}}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

===General Case===

The general formula for the relative velocity &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_\mathrm{B|A}&lt;/math&gt; of an object or observer '''B''' in the rest frame of another object or observer '''A''' is given by the formula:&lt;ref&gt;Fock 1964 The theory of Space Time and Gravitation, retrieved from https://archive.org/details/TheTheoryOfSpaceTimeGravitation&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_\mathrm{B|A}={\frac{1}{\gamma_\mathrm{A}(1-\frac{\vec{v}_\mathrm{A}\vec{v}_\mathrm{B}}{c^2})}}[\vec{v}_\mathrm{B}-\vec{v}_\mathrm{A}+\vec{v}_\mathrm{A}(\gamma_\mathrm{A}-1)(\frac{\vec{v}_\mathrm{A}\cdot \vec{v}_\mathrm{B}}{v_\mathrm{A}^2}-1)]&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_\mathrm{A}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(\frac{v_\mathrm{A}}{c})^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The relative speed is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{B|A}=\sqrt{1-\frac{(c^2-v_\mathrm{A}^2)(c^2 -v_\mathrm{B}^2)}{(c^2-\vec{v}_\mathrm{A}\cdot \vec{v}_\mathrm{B})^2}}*c&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4948">'''Specific detectivity''', or '''''D*''''', for a [[photodetector]] is a [[figure of merit]] used to characterize performance, equal to the reciprocal of [[noise-equivalent power]] (NEP), normalized per square root of the sensor's area and frequency bandwidth (reciprocal of twice the integration time).

Specific detectivity is given by &lt;math&gt;D^*=\frac{\sqrt{Af}}{NEP}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the photosensitive region of the detector and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency bandwidth. It is commonly expressed in ''Jones'' units (&lt;math&gt;cm \cdot \sqrt{Hz}/ W&lt;/math&gt;)in honor of [[Robert Clark Jones]] who originally defined it.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Jones, &quot;Quantum efficiency of photoconductors,&quot; ''Proc. IRIS'' '''2''', 9 (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Jones, &quot;Proposal of the detectivity D** for detectors limited by radiation noise,&quot; ''J. Opt. Soc. Am.'' '''50''', 1058 (1960), {{doi|10.1364/JOSA.50.001058}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that noise-equivalent power can be expressed as a function of the [[responsivity]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; (in units of &lt;math&gt;A/W&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;V/W&lt;/math&gt;) and the [[noise spectral density]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; (in units of &lt;math&gt;A/Hz^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;V/Hz^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt;NEP=\frac{S_n}{\mathfrak{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, it's common to see the specific detectivity expressed as &lt;math&gt;D^*=\frac{\mathfrak{R}\cdot\sqrt{A}}{S_n}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is often useful to express the specific detectivity in terms of relative noise levels present in the device. A common expression is given below.

&lt;math&gt;D^* = \frac{q\lambda \eta}{hc} \left[\frac{4kT}{R_0 A}+2q^2 \eta \Phi_b\right]^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

With ''q'' as the electronic charge, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of interest, ''h'' is Planck's constant, ''c'' is the speed of light, ''k'' is Boltzmann's constant, ''T'' is the temperature of the detector, &lt;math&gt;R_0A&lt;/math&gt; is the zero-bias dynamic resistance area product (often measured experimentally, but also expressible in noise level assumptions), &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the quantum efficiency of the device, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_b&lt;/math&gt; is the total flux of the source (often a blackbody) in photons/sec/cm².

==Detectivity measurement==
Detectivity can be measured from a suitable optical setup using known parameters.
You will need a known light source with known irradiance at a given standoff distance. The incoming light source will be chopped at a certain frequency, and then each wavelet will be integrated over a given time constant over a given number of frames.

In detail, we compute the bandwidth &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt;directly from the integration time constant &lt;math&gt;t_c&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; \Delta f = \frac{1}{2 t_c} &lt;/math&gt;

Next, an rms signal and noise needs to be measured from a set of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; frames. This is done either directly by the instrument, or done as post-processing.

&lt;math&gt; Signal_{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\big( \sum_i^{N} Signal_i^2 \big)} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Noise_{rms} =\sigma^2= \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N (Signal_i - Signal_{avg})^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Now, the computation of the radiance &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in W/sr/cm² must be computed where cm² is the emitting area. Next, emitting area must be converted into a projected area and the [[solid angle]]; this product is often called the [[etendue]]. This step can be obviated by the use of a calibrated source, where the exact number of photons/s/cm² is known at the detector. If this is unknown, it can be estimated using the [[black-body radiation]] equation, detector active area &lt;math&gt;A_d&lt;/math&gt; and the etendue. This ultimately converts the outgoing radiance of the black body in W/sr/cm² of emitting area into one of W observed on the detector.

The broad-band responsivity, is then just the signal weighted by this wattage.

&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{Signal_{rms}}{H G} = \frac{Signal}{\int dH dA_d d\Omega_{BB}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where,
* &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the responsivity in units of Signal / W, (or sometimes V/W or A/W)
* &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the outgoing radiance from the black body (or light source) in W/sr/cm² of emitting area
* &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the total integrated etendue between the emitting source and detector surface
* &lt;math&gt;A_d&lt;/math&gt; is the detector area
* &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{BB}&lt;/math&gt; is the solid angle of the source projected along the line connecting it to the detector surface.

From this metric noise-equivalent power can be computed by taking the noise level over the responsivity.

&lt;math&gt; NEP = \frac{Noise_{rms}}{R}  = \frac{Noise_{rms}}{Signal_{rms}}H G &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, noise-equivalent irradiance can be computed using the responsivity in units of photons/s/W instead of in units of the signal.
Now, the detectivity is simply the noise-equivalent power normalized to the bandwidth and detector area.

&lt;math&gt; D^* = \frac{\sqrt{\Delta f A_d}}{NEP} =  \frac{\sqrt{\Delta f A_d}}{H G} \frac{Signal_{rms}}{Noise_{rms}} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2487">'''Specific force''' is defined as the non-gravitational [[force]] per unit [[mass]].
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Specific Force} = \frac{\mathrm{Force_{non-gravitational}}}{{\mathrm{Mass}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Specific force (also called [[g-force]] and mass-specific force) is measured in [[Metre per second squared|meters/second²]] (m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) which is the units for acceleration. Thus, specific force is not actually a force, but a type of acceleration. However, the (mass-)specific force is not a coordinate-acceleration, but rather a [[proper acceleration]], which is the acceleration relative to free-fall. Forces, specific forces, and [[proper acceleration]]s are the same in all reference frames, but coordinate accelerations are frame-dependent. For free bodies, the specific force is the cause of, and a measure of, the body's [[proper acceleration]].

The [[g-force]] acceleration is the same as the specific force. The acceleration of an object free falling towards the earth depends on the reference frame (it disappears in the free-fall frame, also called the inertial frame), but any g-force &quot;acceleration&quot; will be present in all frames. This specific force is zero for freely-falling objects, since gravity acting alone does not produce g-forces or specific forces.

Accelerometers on the surface of the Earth measure a constant 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s^2 even when they are not accelerating (that is, when they do not undergo coordinate acceleration). This is because accelerometers measure the proper acceleration produced by the g-force exerted by the ground (gravity acting alone never produces g-force or specific force). Accelerometers measure specific force ([[proper acceleration]]), which is the acceleration relative to free-fall,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strapdownassociates.com/Accels%20Measure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; not the &quot;standard&quot; acceleration that is relative to a coordinate system.

==Hydraulics==
In open channel [[hydraulic engineering|hydraulics]], specific force (&lt;math&gt;F_s&lt;/math&gt;) has a different meaning:

:&lt;math&gt;F_s = \frac{Q^2}{gA} + zA&lt;/math&gt;

where Q is the discharge, g is the acceleration due to gravity, A is the cross-sectional area of flow, and z is the depth of the centroid of flow area A.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhry, M. Hanif &quot;Open Channel Flow&quot; 2nd Ed. (2008) pg.31 ISBN 978-0-387-30174-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''specific weight''' (also known as the '''unit weight''') is the [[weight]] per unit [[volume]] of a material.  The symbol of specific weight is '''γ''' (the Greek letter [[Gamma]]).

A commonly used value is the specific weight of [[water]] on [[Earth]] at 5°C which is 9.807 kN/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 62.43 [[Pound (force)|lbf]]/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

 &lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[specific gravity]]'', and less often ''specific weight'', are also used for [[relative density]].

==General formula==

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \rho \, g&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the specific weight of the material ([[weight]] per unit [[volume]], typically N/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; units)
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density]] of the material ([[mass]] per unit volume, typically kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is [[standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity]] (rate of change of [[velocity]], given in m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and on Earth usually given as 9.81 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

==Changes of specific weight==
Unlike density, specific weight is not [[wikt:absolute|absolute]].  It depends upon the value of the [[gravitational acceleration]], which varies with location.  A significant influence upon the value of specific gravity is the [[temperature ]] of the material.  [[Pressure]] may also affect values, depending upon the [[bulk modulus]] of the material, but generally, at moderate pressures, has a less significant effect than the other factors. &lt;ref name=&quot;fluids&quot; /&gt;

==Uses==

===Fluid mechanics===

In [[fluid mechanics]], specific weight represents the [[force]] exerted by [[gravity]] on a unit volume of a fluid.  For this reason, units are expressed as force per unit volume (e.g., N/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).  Specific weight can be used as a characteristic [[List of materials properties|property]] of a fluid. &lt;ref name=&quot;fluids&quot; /&gt;

===Soil mechanics===

Specific weight is often used as a property of soil to solve [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] problems.

In soil mechanics, specific weight may refer to:
*'''Moist unit weight''', which is the unit weight of a soil when void spaces of the soil contain both water and air.

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{(1+w)G_s\gamma_w}{1+e}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the moist unit weight of the material 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_w&lt;/math&gt; is the unit weight of water
:w is the [[moisture content]] of the material 
:Gs is the [[specific gravity]] of the solid
:e is the [[void ratio]]

*'''Dry unit weight''', which is the unit weight of a soil when all void spaces of the soil are completely filled with air, with no water.
The formula for dry unit weight is:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_d = \frac{G_s\gamma_w}{1+e} = \frac{\gamma}{1+w}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the moist unit weight of the material 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_d&lt;/math&gt; is the dry unit weight of the material 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_w&lt;/math&gt; is the unit weight of water
:w is the [[moisture content]] of the material 
:Gs is the [[specific gravity]] of the solid
:e is the [[void ratio]]

*'''Saturated unit weight''', which is the unit weight of a soil when all void spaces of the soil are completely filled with water, with no air.

The formula for saturated unit weight is:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_s = \frac{(G_s+e)\gamma_w}{1+e}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_s&lt;/math&gt; is the saturated unit weight of the material 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_w&lt;/math&gt; is the unit weight of water
:w is the [[moisture content]] of the material 
:Gs is the [[specific gravity]] of the solid
:e is the [[void ratio]]&lt;ref name=&quot;soils&quot;&gt;Das, Braja M. (2007). ''Principles of Geotechnical Engineering''. Canada: Chris Carson.  ISBN 0-495-07316-4. &lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Submerged unit weight''', which is defined as the difference between the saturated unit weight and the unit weight of water. &lt;ref name=&quot;Intelligent Compaction&quot;&gt; The Transtec Group, Inc. (2012). ''Basic Definitions and Terminology of Soils''. http://www.intelligentcompaction.com/downloads/IC_RelatedDocs/SoilCmpct_Basic%20definitions%20of%20Soils.pdf (Page viewed December 7, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; It is often used in the calculation of the [[effective stress]] in a soil. 

The formula for submerged unit weight is:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma^{'} = \gamma_s - \gamma_w&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma^{'}&lt;/math&gt; is the submerged unit weight of the material
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_s&lt;/math&gt; is the saturated unit weight of the material 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_w&lt;/math&gt; is the unit weight of water

===Mechanical engineering===

Specific weight can be used in [[mechanical engineering]] to determine the weight of a structure designed to carry certain loads while remaining intact and remaining within limits regarding [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]].

[[File:NormSPD.png|thumb|[[standard illuminant|CIE standard illuminant]] spectral power distribution comparisons.]]

In [[radiometry]], [[photometry (optics)|photometry]] and [[color science]], a '''spectral power distribution''' ('''SPD''') measurement describes the [[Power (physics)|power]] per unit [[area]] per unit [[wavelength]] of an [[illumination (lighting)|illumination]] ([[radiant exitance]]).  More generally, the term ''spectral power distribution'' can refer to the concentration, as a function of wavelength, of any radiometric or photometric quantity (e.g. [[radiant energy]], [[radiant flux]], [[radiant intensity]], [[radiance]], [[irradiance]], [[radiant exitance]], [[Radiosity (heat transfer)|radiosity]], [[luminance]], [[luminous flux]], [[luminous intensity]], [[illuminance]], [[luminous emittance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Color Appearance Models | author = Mark D.

Knowledge of the SPD is crucial for optical-sensor system applications.  Optical properties such as [[transmittance]], [[reflectivity]], and [[absorbance]] as well as the sensor response are typically dependent on the incident wavelength.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

== Physics of SPD==

Mathematically, for the spectral power distribution of a radiant exitance or irradiance one may write:
: &lt;math&gt;M(\lambda)=\frac{\partial^2\Phi}{\partial A\partial\lambda}\approx\frac{\Phi}{A \Delta\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;M(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[spectral irradiance]] (or exitance) of the light ([[SI]] units: [[watt|W]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = [[kilogram|kg]]/(m·[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)); &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the radiant flux of the source (SI unit: watt, W); &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area over which the radiant flux is integrated (SI unit: square meter, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength (SI unit: meter, m). (Note that it is more convenient to express the wavelength of light in terms of [[nanometer]]s; spectral exitance would then be expressed in units of W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·nm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!--= W·m&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; = W/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = W/µl--&gt;.) The approximation is valid when the area and wavelength interval are small.&lt;ref name=des&gt;{{cite book | title = Radiometric System Design | author = Clair L. Wyatt | isbn = 0029488001 | date = 1987 | publisher = New York: Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relative SPD==
[[File:NormSPD with eye.png|thumb|[[standard illuminant|CIE standard illuminant]] spectral power distribution comparisons referenced to the human visual system [[photopic vision|photopic response]]]]

The ratio of spectral concentration (irradiance or exitance) at a given wavelength to the concentration of a reference wavelength provides the relative SPD.&lt;ref name=meas/&gt;  This can be written as:
: &lt;math&gt;M_{rel}(\lambda)=\frac{M(\lambda)}{M({\lambda_o})}&lt;/math&gt;
For instance, the [[luminance]] of lighting fixtures and other light sources are handled separately, a spectral power distribution may be normalized in some manner, often to unity at 555 or 560 nanometers, coinciding with the peak of the eye's [[luminosity function]].&lt;ref name=focal/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WyszeckiStiles&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Günter | last=Wyszecki |author2=Stiles, Walter Stanley  | title=Color Science: Concepts and Methods; Quantitative Data and Formulae | edition=second | publisher=New York: Wiley | date=1982 | isbn=978-0-471-39918-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsivity==
The SPD can be used to determine the response of a [[sensor]] at a specified wavelength.  This compares the output power of the sensor to the input power as a function of wavelength.&lt;ref name=det&gt;{{cite book | title = Radiometry and the Detection of Optical Radiation | author = Robert W. Boyd | isbn = 047186188X | date = 1983 | publisher = New York: Wiley }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be generalized in the following formula:
: &lt;math&gt;R(\lambda)=\frac{S(\lambda)}{M(\lambda)}&lt;/math&gt;
Knowing the responsitivity is beneficial for determination of illumination, interactive material components, and optical components to optimize performance of a system's design.

==Source SPD and matter==
[[File:Rayleigh sunlight scattering.png|thumb|right|250px|Figure showing the greater proportion of blue light scattered by the atmosphere relative to red light.]]The spectral power distribution over the [[visible spectrum]] from a source can have varying concentrations of relative SPDs.  The interactions between light and matter affect the absorption and reflectance properties of  materials and subsequently produces a color that varies with source illumination.&lt;ref name=mcol&gt;{{cite book | title = The Measurement of Colour | author = William David Wright | date = 1969 | publisher = New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the relative spectral power distribution of the sun produces a white appearance if observed directly, but when the sunlight illuminates the Earth's atmosphere the sky appears blue under normal daylight conditions.  This stems from the optical phenomenon called [[Rayleigh scattering]] which produces a concentration of shorter wavelengths and hence the blue color appearance.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

==Source SPD and color appearance==
[[File:Incand-3500-5500-color-temp-comparison.png|right|thumb|alt=Color temperature comparison of common electric lamps|Color temperature comparison of common electric lamps]]

The human visual response relies on [[trichromacy]] to process color appearance.  While the human visual response integrates over all wavelengths, the relative spectral power distribution will provide [[color appearance model]]ing information as the concentration of wavelength band(s) will become the primary contributors to the perceived color.&lt;ref name=mcol/&gt;

This becomes useful in photometry and [[colorimetry]] as the perceived color changes with source illumination and spectral distribution and coincides with [[Metamerism (color)|metamerisms]] where an object's color appearance changes.&lt;ref name=mcol/&gt;

The spectral makeup of the source can also coincide with [[color temperature]] producing differences in color appearance due to the source's temperature.&lt;ref name=meas/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2033">In [[electrical engineering]], '''susceptance''' (''B'') is the imaginary part of [[admittance]]. The inverse of admittance is [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], and the real part of admittance is [[Electrical conductance|conductance]]. In [[SI]] units, susceptance is measured in [[siemens (unit)|siemens]]. [[Oliver Heaviside]] first defined this property, which he called ''permittance'', in June 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heaviside|first=Oliver|title=Electrical Papers, Volume 2|year=1892|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|location=London and New York|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bywPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330&amp;dq=oliver+heaviside+permittance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yYSnHP1fd2&amp;sig=-QAvwPIN_8sjE0UUSh5mYC9tLWw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zHAyUby2LeGo2wWq4oH4Dg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=oliver%20heaviside%20permittance&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formula==
The general equation defining admittance is given by
:&lt;math&gt;Y = G + j B \,&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''Y'' is the [[admittance]], measured in siemens.
:''G'' is the [[Electrical conductance|conductance]], measured in siemens.
:''j'' is the [[imaginary unit]], and
:''B'' is the susceptance, measured in siemens.

The admittance (''Y'') is the inverse of the impedance (''Z'')

:&lt;math&gt;Y = \frac {1} {Z} = \frac {1} {R + j X} = \left( \frac {R} {R^2+X^2} \right) + j \left( \frac{-X} {R^2+X^2} \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt;B = Im(Y) = \left( \frac{-X} {R^2+X^2} \right) = \frac{-X}{|Z|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;Z = R + j X \,&lt;/math&gt;
:''Z'' is the [[electrical impedance|impedance]], measured in [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]]
:''R'' is the [[electrical resistance|resistance]], measured in ohms
:''X'' is the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]], measured in ohms.

Note: The susceptance is the imaginary part of the admittance.

The magnitude of admittance is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\left | Y \right | = \sqrt {G^2 + B^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2805">The term '''System-specific Impulse, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;ssp&lt;/sub&gt;''' is mostly used to describe the performance of [[jet propulsion]] systems.  A reference number is introduced, which defines the total impulse, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;, delivered by the system, divided by the system mass, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;PS&lt;/sub&gt;:

:''I''&lt;sub&gt;ssp&lt;/sub&gt;=''I''&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;/''m''&lt;sub&gt;PS&lt;/sub&gt;
Because of the resulting dimension, - delivered impulse per kilogram of system mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;PS&lt;/sub&gt;, this number is called ‘System-specific Impulse’. In [[SI]] units, impulse is measured in newton-seconds (N·s) and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;ssp&lt;/sub&gt; in N·s/kg.

The ''I''&lt;sub&gt;ssp&lt;/sub&gt; allows a more accurate determination of the propulsive performance of jet propulsion systems than the commonly used [[Specific Impulse|Specific Impulse, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]], which only takes into account the propellant and the thrust engine performance characteristics. Therefore, the ''I''&lt;sub&gt;ssp&lt;/sub&gt; permits an objective and comparative performance evaluation of systems of different designs and with different [[propellant]]s.

The ''I''&lt;sub&gt;ssp&lt;/sub&gt; can be derived directly from actual jet propulsion systems by determining the total impulse delivered by the mass of contained propellant, divided by the known total (wet) mass of the propulsion system. This allows a quantitative comparison of for example, built systems.

In addition, the ''I''&lt;sub&gt;ssp&lt;/sub&gt; can be derived analytically, for example for spacecraft propulsion systems, in order to facilitate a preliminary selection of systems (chemical, electrical) for spacecraft missions of given impulse and velocity-increment requirements. A more detailed presentation of derived mathematical formulas for ''I''&lt;sub&gt;ssp&lt;/sub&gt; and their applications for spacecraft propulsion is given below.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Performance Evaluation of Spacecraft Propulsion Systems in Relation to Mission Impulse Requirements&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9712">In [[physics]], '''thermal contact conductance''' is the study of [[heat conduction]] between [[solid]] bodies in [[thermal contact]]. The '''thermal contact conductance coefficient''', &lt;math&gt;h_c&lt;/math&gt;, is a property indicating the [[thermal conductivity]], or ability to conduct [[heat]], between two bodies in contact. The inverse of this property is termed '''thermal contact resistance'''.

==Definition==
[[Image:Contact conductance.svg|right|thumb|295px|Fig. 1: Heat flow between two solids in contact and the temperature distribution.]]

When two solid bodies come in contact, such as A and B in Figure 1, heat flows from the hotter body to the colder body. From experience, the [[temperature]] profile along the two bodies varies, approximately, as shown in the figure. A temperature drop is observed at the interface between the two surfaces in contact. This phenomenon is said to be a result of a ''thermal contact resistance'' existing between the contacting surfaces. Thermal contact resistance is defined as the ratio between this temperature drop and the average heat flow across the interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Holman
  | first = J. P.
  | title = Heat Transfer, 8th Edition
  | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]]
  | year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to '''[[Fourier's law]]''', the heat flow between the bodies is found by the relation:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;q=-kA\frac{dT}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flow, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal conductivity, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the cross sectional area and &lt;math&gt;dT/dx&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature gradient in the direction of flow.

From considerations of [[energy conservation]], the heat flow between the two bodies in contact, bodies A and B, is found as:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;q=\frac{T_1 - T_3}{\Delta x_A/(k_A A)+1/(h_c A) + \Delta x_B/(k_B A)}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

One may observe that the heat flow is directly related to the thermal conductivities of the bodies in contact, &lt;math&gt;k_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt;, the contact area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and the thermal contact resistance, &lt;math&gt;1/h_c&lt;/math&gt;, which, as previously noted, is the inverse of the thermal conductance coefficient, &lt;math&gt;h_c&lt;/math&gt;.

==Importance==
Most experimentally determined values of the thermal contact resistance fall between
0.000005 and 0.0005 m² K/W (the corresponding range of thermal contact
conductance is 2000 to 200,000 W/m² K). To know whether the thermal contact resistance is significant or not,  magnitudes of the thermal resistances of the layers are compared with typical values of thermal contact resistance. Thermal contact resistance is significant and may dominate for good heat conductors such as metals but can be neglected for poor heat conductors such as insulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer|author=Çengel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thermal contact conductance is an important factor in a variety of applications, largely because many physical systems contain a [[mechanics|mechanical]] combination of two materials. Some of the fields where contact conductance is of importance are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Factors influencing contact conductance==
[[Image:Solids in contact.svg|right|thumb|150px|Fig. 2: An enlargement of the interface between two contacting surfaces. The finish quality is exaggerated for the sake of the argument.]]
Thermal contact conductance is a complicated phenomenon, influenced by many factors. Experience shows that the most important ones are as follows:

===Contact pressure===
The contact [[pressure]] is the factor of most influence on contact conductance. As contact pressure grows, contact conductance grows (And consequentially, contact resistance becomes smaller).{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}  This is attributed to the fact that the contact surface between the bodies grows as the contact pressure grows.

Since the contact pressure is the most important factor, most studies, [[correlation]]s and [[mathematical model]]s for measurement of contact conductance are done as a function of this factor.

The thermal contact resistance of certain sandwich kinds of materials that are manufactured by rolling under high temperatures may sometimes be ignored because the decrease in thermal conductivity between them is negligible.

===Interstitial materials===
{{main|interstitial defect}}
No truly smooth surfaces really exist, and surface imperfections are visible under a [[microscope]]. As a result, when two bodies are pressed together, contact is only performed in a finite number of points, separated by relatively large gaps, as can be shown in Fig. 2. Since the actual contact area is reduced, another resistance for heat flow exists. The [[gas]]es/[[fluids]] filling these gaps may largely influence the total heat flow across the interface. The thermal conductivity of the interstitial material and its pressure are the two properties governing its influence on contact conductance.

In the absence of interstitial materials, as in a [[vacuum]], the contact resistance will be much larger, since flow through the intimate contact points is dominant.

===Surface roughness, waviness and flatness===
One can characterise a surface that has undergone certain [[surface finishing|finishing]] operations by three properties: roughness, [[waviness]] and flatness. Among these, roughness is of most importance, and is usually indicated by an [[root mean square|rms]] value, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

===Surface deformations===
When the two bodies come in contact, surface [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] may occur on both bodies. This deformation may either be [[Plastic deformation of solids|plastic]] or [[Deformation (engineering)#Elastic deformation|elastic]], depending on the material properties and the contact pressure. When a surface undergoes plastic deformation, contact resistance is lowered, since the deformation causes the actual contact area to increase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | first = M.
  |author2=Majumdar, A.
   | title = Effect of Surface Deformations on Contact Conductance
  | journal = Journal of Heat Transfer
  | date = November 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Heat Transfer Division
  | title = Conduction in Solids - Steady State, Imperfect Metal-to-Metal Surface Contact
  | journal = General Electric Inc.
  | date = November 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface cleanliness===
The presence of [[dust]] [[wiktionary:Particle|particles]], [[acids]], etc., can also influence the contact conductance.

==Measurement of thermal contact conductance==
Going back to Formula 2, calculation of the thermal contact conductance may prove difficult, even impossible, due to the difficulty in measuring the contact area, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (A product of surface characteristics, as explained earlier). Because of this, contact conductance/resistance is usually found experimentally, by using a standard apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM D 5470 – 06 Standard Test Method for Thermal Transmission Properties of Thermally Conductive Electrical Insulation Materials&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of such experiments are usually published in [[Engineering]] [[literature]], on [[Scientific journal|journal]]s such as ''[http://scitation.aip.org/ASMEJournals/HeatTransfer/ Journal of Heat Transfer]'', ''[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/210/description#description International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer]'', etc. Unfortunately, a centralized [[database]] of contact conductance coefficients does not exist, a situation which sometimes causes companies to use outdated, irrelevant data, or not taking contact conductance as a consideration at all.

''[http://sourceforge.net/projects/cocoe/ CoCoE]'' (Contact Conductance Estimator), a project founded to solve this problem and create a centralized database of contact conductance data and a computer program that uses it, was started in [[2006 in science|2006]].

==Thermal boundary conductance==

While a finite thermal contact conductance is due to voids at the interface, surface waviness, and surface roughness, etc.,  a finite conductance exists even at near ideal interfaces as well.  This conductance, known as [[Interfacial thermal resistance|thermal boundary conductance]], is due to the differences in electronic and vibrational properties between the contacting materials.  This conductance is generally much higher than thermal contact conductance, but becomes important in nanoscale material systems.

D. Baehr and K. Stephan, ''Wärme- und Stoffübertragung 4. Auflage'', Springer,  (2004), p 172, ISBN 3-540-40130-X&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_m = T_1 + (T_2-T_1){e_2 \over (e_2+e_1)}&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is valid for all times for semi-infinite bodies in perfect thermal contact. It is also a good first guess for the initial contact temperature for finite bodies.

'''Direct measurement''' of thermal effusivity be performed via specialty sensors, as pictured to the right.

'''Thermal emittance''' or '''thermal emissivity''' is the ratio of the [[radiant emittance]] of [[heat]] of a specific object or surface to that of a standard [[black body]]. Emissivity and emittivity are both [[dimensionless quantities]] given in the range of 0 to 1, but [[emissivity]] refers to a [[material property]] (of a homogeneous material), while emittivity refers to specific samples or objects.

For building products, thermal emittance measurements are taken for wavelengths in the [[infrared]]. Determining the thermal emittance and [[solar reflectance]] of building materials, especially [[roofing]] materials, can be very useful for reducing heating and cooling [[energy accounting|energy costs]] in buildings. Combined index Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) is often used to determine the overall ability to reflect solar heat and release thermal heat. A roofing surface with high solar reflectance and high thermal emittance will reflect solar heat and release absorbed heat readily. High thermal emittance material radiates thermal heat back into the atmosphere more-readily than one with a low thermal emittance.

In [[electromagnetism]], '''electric flux''' is the measure of flow of the [[electric field]] through a given area. Electric flux is proportional to the number of electric [[field line]]s going through a normally perpendicular surface. If the electric field is uniform, the electric flux passing through a surface of [[vector area]] {{math|'''S'''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_E = \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{S} = ES \cos \theta,
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''E'''}} is the electric field (having units of {{math|V/m}}), {{math|''E''}} is its magnitude, {{math|''S''}} is the area of the surface, and {{math|''θ''}} is the angle between the electric field lines and the normal (perpendicular) to {{math|''S''}}.

For a non-uniform electric field, the electric flux {{math|''d''Φ&lt;sub&gt;'''''E'''''&lt;/sub&gt;}} through a small surface area {{math|''d'''''S'''}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;d\Phi_E = \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;
(the electric field, {{math|'''E'''}}, multiplied by the component of area parallel to the field).  The electric flux over a surface {{math|''S''}} is therefore given by the [[surface integral]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_E = \iint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''E'''}} is the electric field and {{math|''d'''''S'''}} is a differential area on the closed surface {{math|''S''}} with an outward facing [[surface normal]] defining its direction.

For a closed [[Gaussian surface]], electric flux is given by:
:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\Phi_E =\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{S} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;}}

where
:{{math|'''E'''}} is the [[electric field]],
:{{math|''S''}} is any [[closed surface]],
:{{math|''Q''}} is the total [[electric charge]] inside the surface {{math|''S''}},
:{{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[electric constant]] (a universal constant, also called the &quot;[[permittivity]] of free space&quot;) (&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 8.854 187 817... x 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;  [[farad]]s per [[meter]] (F·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)).
This relation is known as [[Gauss' law]] for electric field in its [[integral]] form and it is one of the four [[Maxwell's equations]].

While the electric flux is not affected by charges that are not within the closed surface, the net electric field, {{math|'''E'''}}, in the Gauss' Law equation, can be affected by charges that lie outside the closed surface. While Gauss' Law holds for all situations, it is only useful for &quot;by hand&quot; calculations when high degrees of symmetry exist in the electric field.  Examples include spherical and cylindrical symmetry.

Electrical flux has [[SI]] units of [[volt]] [[metre]]s ({{math|''V m''}}), or, equivalently, [[newton (unit)|newton]] metres squared per [[coulomb]] ({{math|''N m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''C''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}). Thus, the [[SI]] base units of electric flux are {{math|''kg·m''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''·s''&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''·A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Its dimensional formula is {{math|[L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MT&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4777">The '''angular diameter distance''' is a distance measure used in [[astronomy]]. The angular diameter distance to an object is defined in terms of the object's actual size, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; the angular size of the object as viewed from earth. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
d_A= \frac{x}{\theta}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The angular diameter distance depends on the assumed [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] of the universe. The angular diameter distance to an object at [[redshift]], &lt;math&gt; z &lt;/math&gt;, is expressed in terms of the [[comoving distance]], &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; as:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
d_A = \frac{r(\chi)}{1+z}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt; r(\chi)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
r(\chi) = \begin{cases}
\sin \left( \sqrt{-\Omega_k} H_0 \chi \right)/\left(H_0\sqrt{|\Omega_k|}\right) &amp; \Omega_k &lt; 0\\
\chi &amp; \Omega_k=0 \\
\sinh \left( \sqrt{\Omega_k} H_0 \chi \right)/\left(H_0\sqrt{|\Omega_k|}\right) &amp; \Omega_k &gt;0
\end{cases}

&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt; \Omega_k &lt;/math&gt; is the curvature density and &lt;math&gt; H_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the value of the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] today.

In the [[Lambda-CDM model|currently favoured geometric model of our Universe]], the &quot;angular diameter distance&quot; of an object is a good approximation to the &quot;real distance&quot;, i.e. the [[comoving distance|proper distance]] when the light left the object. Note that beyond a certain [[redshift]], the angular diameter distance gets smaller with increasing [[redshift]]. In other words, an object &quot;behind&quot; another of the same size, beyond a certain redshift (roughly z=1.5), appears larger on the sky, and would therefore have a ''smaller'' &quot;angular diameter distance&quot;.

==Angular size redshift relation==
[[Image:Angular-size-redshift-relation.png|thumb|The angular size redshift relation for a [[Lambda-CDM model|Lambda]] [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], with on the vertical scale kiloparsecs per arcsecond.]]

[[File:Distanza di diametro angolare.png|thumb|The angular size redshift relation for a [[Lambda-CDM model|Lambda]] [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], with on the vertical scale megaparsecs.]]

The '''angular size redshift relation''' describes the relation between the angular size observed on the sky of an object of given physical size, and the objects [[redshift]] from [[Earth]] (which is related to its distance, &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt;, from Earth). In a [[Euclidean geometry]] the relation between size on the sky and distance from Earth would simply be given by the equation:

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Distanza_di_diametro_angolare.png]] --&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \tan\left ( \theta \right )= \frac{x}{d} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is the angular size of the object on the sky, &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is the size of the object and &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the object. Where &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is small this approximates to:

&lt;math&gt; \theta \approx \frac{x}{d} &lt;/math&gt;.

However, in the [[Lambda-CDM model|currently favoured geometric model of our Universe]], the relation is more complicated. In this model, objects at [[redshift]]s greater than about 1.5 appear larger on the sky with increasing [[redshift]].

This is related to the angular diameter distance, which is the distance an object is calculated to be at from &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, assuming the Universe is [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]].

The actual relation between the angular-diameter distance, &lt;math&gt;d_A&lt;/math&gt;, and redshift is given below. &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; is called the deceleration parameter and measures the deceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe; in the simplest models, &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;0.5&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the case where the Universe will expand for ever, &lt;math&gt;q_0&gt;0.5&lt;/math&gt; to closed models which will ultimately stop expanding and contract &lt;math&gt;q_0=0.5&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the critical case&amp;nbsp;– Universes which will just be able to expand to infinity without re-contracting.

&lt;math&gt;d_A=\cfrac{c}{H_0 q^2_0} \cfrac{(zq_0+(q_0 -1)(\sqrt{2q_0 z+1}-1))}{(1+z)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Mattig relation]] yields the angular-diameter distance as a function of redshift for a universe with ΩΛ = 0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.se/books?id=RK8qDGKSTPwC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=%22The+Mattig+relation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_WFDJvBzDl&amp;sig=dXymoGGOi92YwRpz_9E5TXHIzbI&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=8NApTNXGLY2tOI6P7LID&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Mattig%20relation%22&amp;f=false An introduction to the science of cosmology, Chapter 6:2] by Derek J.

In [[Big Bang|standard cosmology]], '''comoving distance''' and '''proper distance''' are two closely related [[distance measures (cosmology)|distance measures used by cosmologists]] to define distances between objects. ''Proper distance'' roughly corresponds to where a distant object would be at a specific moment of [[cosmological time]], which can change over time due to the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]]. ''Comoving distance'' factors out the expansion of the universe, giving a distance that does not change in time due to the expansion of space (though this may change due to other, local factors such as the motion of a galaxy within a cluster). Comoving distance and proper distance are defined to be equal at the present time; therefore, the ratio of proper distance to comoving distance now is 1. At other times, the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] differs from 1. The Universe's expansion results in the proper distance changing, while the comoving distance is unchanged by this expansion because it is the proper distance divided by that scale factor.

==Comoving coordinates==

Although general relativity allows one to formulate the laws of physics using arbitrary coordinates, some coordinate choices are more natural or easier to work with. Comoving coordinates are an example of such a natural coordinate choice. They assign constant spatial coordinate values to observers who perceive the universe as [[isotropic]].  Such observers are called &quot;comoving&quot; observers because they move along with the [[Hubble flow]].
&lt;!--was: a scientist to [[formula|formulate]] the laws of physics using an arbitrary system of [[coordinates]], a scientist's job can be simplified by utilizing different coordinate systems that are easy to work with. --&gt;

A comoving observer is the only observer that will perceive the universe, including the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], to be [[isotropic]]. Non-comoving observers will see regions of the sky systematically [[blue-shift]]ed or [[red-shift]]ed.  Thus isotropy, particularly isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation, defines a special local [[frame of reference]] called the [[comoving frame]]. The velocity of an observer relative to the local comoving frame is called the [[peculiar velocity]] of the observer.

Most large lumps of matter, such as galaxies, are nearly comoving, so that their peculiar velocities (owing to gravitational attraction) are low.

The '''comoving time''' coordinate is the elapsed time since the [[Big Bang]] according to a clock of a comoving observer and is a measure of [[cosmological time]]. The comoving spatial coordinates tell us '''where''' an event occurs while cosmological time tells us '''when''' an event occurs. Together, they form a complete [[coordinate system]], giving us both the location and time of an event.

Space in comoving coordinates is usually referred to as being &quot;static&quot;, as most bodies on the scale of galaxies or larger are approximately comoving, and comoving bodies have static, unchanging comoving coordinates. So for a given pair of comoving galaxies, while the proper distance between them would have been smaller in the past and will become larger in the future due to the expansion of space, the comoving distance between them remains ''constant'' at all times.

The expanding Universe has an increasing [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] which explains how constant comoving distances are reconciled with proper distances that increase with time.

==Comoving distance and proper distance==

''Comoving distance'' is the distance between two points measured along a path defined at the present [[cosmological time]]. For objects moving with the Hubble flow, it is deemed to remain constant in time. The comoving distance from an observer to a distant object (e.g. galaxy) can be computed by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt; \chi = \int_{t_e}^t c \; {\mbox{d} t' \over a(t')} &lt;/math&gt;

where  ''a''(''t&amp;prime;'') is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]], ''t''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the time of emission of the photons detected by the observer, ''t'' is the present time, and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.

Despite being an [[time integral|integral over time]], this does give the distance that ''would'' be measured by a hypothetical tape measure at ''fixed'' time ''t'', i.e. the &quot;proper distance&quot; as defined below, divided by the scale factor ''a''(''t'') at that time. For a derivation see &quot;standard relativistic definitions&quot; from Davis &amp; Lineweaver 2004.&lt;ref name=D&amp;L_EC&gt;{{cite journal| author=T.M. Davis, C.H.

;'''Definitions'''
* Many textbooks use the symbol &lt;math&gt;\! \chi&lt;/math&gt; for the comoving distance. However, this &lt;math&gt;\! \chi&lt;/math&gt; must be distinguished from the ''coordinate'' distance r in the commonly used comoving coordinate system for a [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FLRW universe]] where the metric takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;\! ds^2 = -c^2 d\tau^2 = - c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1 - kr^2} + r^2 \left(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta d\phi^2 \right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
:In this case the comoving coordinate distance &lt;math&gt;\! r&lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt;\! \chi&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\! \chi = r&lt;/math&gt; if k=0 (a spatially flat universe), by &lt;math&gt;\! \chi = \sin^{-1} r&lt;/math&gt; if k=1 (a positively curved 'spherical' universe), and by &lt;math&gt;\! \chi = \sinh^{-1} r&lt;/math&gt; if k=-1 (a negatively curved 'hyperbolic' universe).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://books.google.com/books?id=3LO75VmI9BMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 9-12] of ''The Cosmological Background Radiation'' by Marc Lachièze-Rey and Edgard Gunzig, or [http://books.google.com/books?id=ntZwxttZF-sC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA263#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 263] ''Measuring the Universe: The Cosmological Distance Ladder'' by Stephen Webb.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Most textbooks and research papers define the comoving distance between comoving observers to be a fixed unchanging quantity independent of time, while calling the dynamic, changing distance between them '''proper distance'''.  On this usage, comoving and proper distances are numerically equal at the current age of the universe, but will differ in the past and in the future; if the comoving distance to a galaxy is denoted &lt;math&gt;\! \chi&lt;/math&gt;, the proper distance &lt;math&gt;\! d(t)&lt;/math&gt; at an arbitrary time &lt;math&gt;\! t&lt;/math&gt; is simply given by &lt;math&gt;\! d(t) = a(t) \chi&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\! a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] (e.g. Davis &amp; Limeweaver 2004).&lt;ref name=D&amp;L_EC/&gt; The proper distance &lt;math&gt;\! d(t)&lt;/math&gt; between two galaxies at time ''t'' is just the distance that would be measured by rulers between them at that time.&lt;ref&gt;see p. 4 of [http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9905116v4 Distance Measures in Cosmology] by David W. Hogg.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses of the proper distance===
[[Cosmological time]] is identical to locally measured time for an observer at a fixed comoving spatial position, that is, in the local [[comoving frame]].  Proper distance is also equal to the locally measured distance in the comoving frame for ''nearby'' objects.  To measure the proper distance between two ''distant'' objects, one imagines that one has many comoving observers in a straight line between the two objects, so that all of the observers are close to each other, and form a chain between the two distant objects.  All of these observers must have the same cosmological time.  Each observer measures their distance to the nearest observer in the chain, and the length of the chain, the sum of distances between nearby observers, is the total proper distance.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Weinberg, ''Gravitation and Cosmology'' (1972), p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- a diagram would probably be helpful --&gt;

It is important to the definition of both comoving distance and proper distance in the cosmological sense (as opposed to [[proper length]] in [[special relativity]]) that all observers have the same cosmological age.  For instance, if one measured the distance along a straight line or [[Spacetime#Spacetime in general relativity|spacelike]] [[geodesic]] between the two points, observers situated between the two points would have different cosmological ages when the geodesic path crossed their own [[world line]]s, so in calculating the distance along this geodesic one would not be correctly measuring comoving distance or cosmological proper distance.  Comoving and proper distances are not the same concept of distance as the concept of distance in special relativity.  This can be seen by considering the hypothetical case of a universe empty of mass, where both sorts of distance can be measured. When the density of mass in the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FLRW metric]] is set to zero (an empty '[[Milne universe]]'), then the cosmological coordinate system used to write this metric becomes a non-inertial coordinate system in the [[Minkowski space]]time of special relativity where surfaces of constant Minkowski proper-time τ appear as [[hyperbola]]s in the [[Minkowski diagram]] from the perspective of an [[inertial frame of reference]].&lt;ref&gt;See the diagram on [http://books.google.com/books?id=1TXO7GmwZFgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 28] of ''Physical Foundations of Cosmology'' by V. F. Mukhanov, along with the accompanying discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, for two events which are simultaneous according to the cosmological time coordinate, the value of the cosmological proper distance is not equal to the value of the [[proper length]] between these same events,&lt;ref name=E.L.W_HI&gt;{{cite web| author=E.L. Wright| title=Homogeneity and Isotropy| url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_02.htm| publisher=E.L. Wright| date=2009| accessdate=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would just be the distance along a straight line between the events in a Minkowski diagram (and a straight line is a [[geodesic]] in flat Minkowski spacetime), or the coordinate distance between the events in the inertial frame where they are [[relativity of simultaneity|simultaneous]].

If one divides a change in proper distance by the interval of cosmological time where the change was measured (or takes the [[derivative]] of proper distance with respect to cosmological time) and calls this a &quot;velocity&quot;, then the resulting &quot;velocities&quot; of galaxies or quasars can be above the speed of light, ''c''.  This apparent superluminal expansion is not in conflict with special or general relativity, and is a consequence of the particular definitions used in cosmology. Even light itself does not have a &quot;velocity&quot; of ''c'' in this sense; the total velocity of any object can be expressed as the sum &lt;math&gt;\! v_{tot} = v_{rec} + v_{pec}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\! v_{rec}&lt;/math&gt; is the recession velocity due to the expansion of the universe (the velocity given by [[Hubble's law]]) and &lt;math&gt;\! v_{pec}&lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;peculiar velocity&quot; measured by local observers (with &lt;math&gt;\! v_{rec} = \dot{a}(t) \chi(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\! v_{pec} = a(t) \dot{\chi}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the dots indicating a first [[derivative]]), so for light &lt;math&gt;\! v_{pec}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to ''c'' (-''c'' if the light is emitted towards our position at the origin and +''c'' if emitted away from us) but the total velocity &lt;math&gt;\! v_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is generally different from ''c''.&lt;ref name=D&amp;L_EC/&gt; Even in special relativity the coordinate speed of light is only guaranteed to be ''c'' in an [[inertial frame of reference|inertial frame]]; in a non-inertial frame the coordinate speed may be different from ''c''.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://books.google.com/books?id=AzfFo6A94WEC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 219] of ''Relativity and the Nature of Spacetime'' by Vesselin Petkov&lt;/ref&gt; In general relativity no coordinate system on a large region of curved spacetime is &quot;inertial&quot;, but in the local neighborhood of any point in curved spacetime we can define a &quot;local inertial frame&quot; in which the local speed of light is ''c''&lt;ref&gt;see [http://books.google.com/books?id=RK8qDGKSTPwC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 94] of ''An Introduction to the Science of Cosmology'' by Derek J. Raine, Edwin George Thomas, and E. G. Thomas&lt;/ref&gt; and in which massive objects such as stars and galaxies always have a local speed smaller than ''c''. The cosmological definitions used to define the velocities of distant objects are coordinate-dependent - there is no general coordinate-independent definition of velocity between distant objects in general relativity.&lt;ref name=Baez&amp;Bunn&gt;{{cite web| author=J. Baez and E. Bunn| title=Preliminaries| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/einstein/node2.html| publisher=University of California| date=2006| accessdate=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of how best to describe and popularize the apparent superluminal expansion of the universe has caused a minor amount of controversy.  One viewpoint is presented in Davis and Lineweaver, 2004.&lt;ref name=D&amp;L_EC/&gt;

===Short distances vs. long distances===

Within small distances and short trips, the expansion of the universe during the trip can be ignored. This is because the travel time between any two points for a non-relativistic moving particle will just be the proper distance (that is, the comoving distance measured using the scale factor of the universe at the time of the trip rather than the scale factor &quot;now&quot;) between those points divided by the velocity of the particle.  If the particle is moving at a relativistic velocity, the usual relativistic corrections for time dilation must be made.

'''Distance measures''' are used in [[physical cosmology]] to give a natural notion of the [[distance]] between two objects or events in the [[universe]].  They are often used to tie some ''observable'' quantity (such as the [[luminosity]] of a distant [[quasar]], the [[redshift]] of a distant [[galaxy]], or the angular size of the acoustic peaks in the [[CMB]] power spectrum) to another quantity that is not ''directly'' observable, but is more convenient for calculations (such as the [[comoving coordinates]] of the quasar, galaxy, etc.). The distance measures discussed here all reduce to the common notion of [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean]] distance at low redshift.

In accord with our present understanding of cosmology, these measures are calculated within the context of [[general relativity]], where the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] solution is used to describe the universe.

==Overview==

There are a few different definitions of &quot;distance&quot; in cosmology which all coincide for sufficiently small [[redshift]]s. The expressions for these distances are most practical when written as functions of redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, since redshift is always the observable. They can easily be written as functions of [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a=1/(1+z)&lt;/math&gt;, [[Cosmic time|cosmic]] &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; or [[conformal time]] &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; as well by performing a simple transformation of variables. By defining the dimensionless [[Hubble parameter]]
:&lt;math&gt;E(z)=\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z)^3+\Omega_k(1+z)^2+\Omega_\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
and the Hubble distance &lt;math&gt; d_H = c/H_0 &lt;/math&gt;, the relation between the different distances becomes apparent. Here, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_m&lt;/math&gt; is the total matter density, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dark energy]] density, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k = 1-\Omega_m-\Omega_\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; represents the curvature, &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the Hubble parameter today and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]]. The following measures for distances from the observer to an object at redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; along the line of sight are commonly used in cosmology:&lt;ref name=Hogg&gt;{{cite arXiv|title=Distance measures in cosmology |author=David W. Hogg |year=2000 |arxiv=astro-ph/9905116v4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comoving distance:'''
:&lt;math&gt;  d_C(z)  = d_H \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')}&lt;/math&gt;
'''Transverse comoving distance:'''
:&lt;math&gt;  d_M(z) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{d_H}{\sqrt{\Omega_k}} \sinh\left(\sqrt{\Omega_k}d_C(z)/d_H\right) &amp; \text{for } \Omega_k&gt;0\\
d_C(z) &amp; \text{for }\Omega_k=0\\
\frac{d_H}{\sqrt{|\Omega_k}|} \sin\left(\sqrt{|\Omega_k|}d_C(z)/d_H\right) &amp; \text{for }\Omega_k&lt;0\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
'''Angular diameter distance:'''
:&lt;math&gt; d_A(z)  = \frac{d_M(z)}{1+z}&lt;/math&gt;
'''Luminosity distance:'''
:&lt;math&gt;  d_L(z)  = (1+z) d_M(z)&lt;/math&gt;
'''Light-travel distance:'''
:&lt;math&gt;d_T(z) = d_H \int_0^z \frac{d z'}{(1+z')E(z')} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the comoving distance is recovered from the transverse comoving distance by taking the limit &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, such that the two distance measures are equivalent in a [[flat universe]].

Age of the universe is &lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\rightarrow\infty} d_T(z)/c&lt;/math&gt;, and the time elapsed since redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; until now is
:&lt;math&gt; t(z) = d_T(z)/c &lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative terminology==

Peebles (1993) calls the transverse comoving distance the &quot;angular size distance&quot;, which is not to be mistaken for the angular diameter distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;peebles1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Physical Cosmology |publisher=Princeton University Press |first=P. J. E. |last=Peebles |pages=310–320 |year=1993 |bibcode=1993ppc..book.....P |isbn=978-0-691-01933-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it is not a matter of nomenclature, the comoving distance is equivalent to the proper motion distance, which is defined as the ratio of the transverse velocity and its proper motion in radians per time. Occasionally, the symbols &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; are used to denote both the comoving and the angular diameter distance. Sometimes, the light-travel distance is also called the &quot;lookback distance&quot;.

==Details==

===Comoving distance===
{{Main|Comoving distance}}

The comoving distance between fundamental observers, i.e. observers that are comoving with the [[Hubble's law|Hubble flow]], does not change with time, as it accounts for the expansion of the universe. It is obtained by integrating up the proper distances of nearby fundamental observers along the line of sight ('''LOS'''), where the proper distance is what a measurement at constant cosmic time would yield.

===Transverse comoving distance===

Two comoving objects at constant redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; that are separated by an angle &lt;math&gt;\delta\theta&lt;/math&gt; on the sky are said to have the distance &lt;math&gt;\delta\theta d_M(z)&lt;/math&gt;, where the transverse comoving distance &lt;math&gt;d_M&lt;/math&gt; is defined appropriately.

===Angular diameter distance===
{{Main|Angular diameter distance}}

An object of size &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; that appears to have angular size &lt;math&gt;\delta\theta&lt;/math&gt; has the angular diameter distance of &lt;math&gt;d_A(z)=x/\delta\theta&lt;/math&gt;. This is commonly used to observe so called [[standard ruler]]s, for example in the context of [[baryon acoustic oscillations]].

===Luminosity distance===
{{Main|Luminosity distance}}

If the intrinsic [[luminosity]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of a distant object is known, we can calculate its luminosity distance by measuring the flux &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and determine &lt;math&gt;d_L(z)=\sqrt{L/4\pi S}&lt;/math&gt;, which turns out to be equivalent to the expression above for &lt;math&gt;d_L(z)&lt;/math&gt;. This quantity is important for measurements of [[standard candles]] like [[type Ia supernovae]], which were first used to discover the acceleration of the [[Dark Energy|expansion of the universe]].

===Light-travel distance===

This distance is the time (in years) that it took light to reach the observer from the object multiplied by the [[speed of light]]. For instance, the radius of the [[observable universe]] in this distance measure becomes the age of the universe multiplied by the speed of light (1 light year/year) i.e. 13.8 billion light years. Also see [[Observable universe#Misconceptions on its size|misconceptions]] about the size of the visible universe.

===Etherington's distance duality===
{{Main|Etherington's reciprocity theorem}}

The Etherington's distance-duality equation &lt;ref&gt;I.M.H. Etherington, “LX. On the Definition of Distance in
General Relativity”, Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 15, S. 7 (1933), pp. 761-773.&lt;/ref&gt; is the relationship between the luminosity distance of standard candles and the angular-diameter distance. It is expressed as follows: &lt;math&gt;d_L=(1+z)^2 d_A &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2890">'''Luminosity distance''' ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined in terms of the relationship between the [[absolute magnitude]] ''M'' and [[apparent magnitude]] ''m'' of an astronomical object.

:&lt;math&gt; M = m - 5 (\log_{10}{D_L} - 1)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

which gives:

:&lt;math&gt; D_L = 10^{\frac{(m - M)}{5}+1}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is measured in [[parsec]]s. For nearby objects (say, in the [[Milky Way]]) the luminosity distance gives a good approximation to the natural notion of distance in [[Euclidean space]].

The relation is less clear for distant objects like [[quasar]]s far beyond the [[Milky Way]] since the apparent magnitude is affected by [[spacetime]] [[curvature]], [[redshift]], and [[time dilation]]. Calculating the relation between the apparent and actual luminosity of an object requires taking all of these factors into account. The object's actual luminosity is determined using the inverse-square law and the proportions of the object's apparent distance and luminosity distance.

Another way to express the luminosity distance is through the flux-luminosity relationship. Since,

:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{L}{4\pi D_L^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is flux (W·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;), and ''L'' is luminosity (W), or where ''F'' is flux (erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;), and ''L'' is luminosity (erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). From this the luminosity distance can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; D_L = \sqrt{\frac{L}{4\pi F}}&lt;/math&gt;

The luminosity distance is related to the &quot;comoving transverse distance&quot; &lt;math&gt;D_M&lt;/math&gt; by the Etherington's reciprocity relation{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}:

:&lt;math&gt; D_L = (1 + z) D_M&lt;/math&gt;

where ''z'' is the [[redshift]]. &lt;math&gt;D_M&lt;/math&gt; is a factor that allows you to calculate the [[comoving distance]] between two objects with the same redshift but at different positions of the sky; if the two objects are separated by an angle &lt;math&gt;\delta \theta&lt;/math&gt;, the comoving distance between them would be &lt;math&gt;D_M \delta \theta&lt;/math&gt;. In a spatially flat universe, the comoving transverse distance &lt;math&gt;D_M&lt;/math&gt; is exactly equal to the radial comoving distance &lt;math&gt;D_C&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the comoving distance from ourselves to the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Andrea Gabrielli|author2=F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4784">The '''persistence length''' is a basic mechanical property quantifying the [[stiffness]] of a [[polymer]].

Informally, for pieces of the polymer that are shorter than the persistence length, the molecule behaves rather like a flexible elastic rod, while for pieces of the polymer that are much longer than the persistence length, the properties can only be described statistically, like a three-dimensional [[random walk]].

Formally, the persistence length, ''P'', is defined as the length over which correlations in the direction of the tangent are lost. In a more chemical based manner it can also be defined as the average sum of the projections of all bonds  j ≥ i on bond i in an infinitely long chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Statistical Mechanics of Chain Molecules |first=Paul J. |last=Flory |publisher=Interscience Publishers |location=New York |year=1969 |isbn=0-470-26495-0 |url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL5613440M/Statistical_mechanics_of_chain_molecules}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let us define the angle ''&amp;theta;'' between a vector that is tangent to the polymer at position 0 (zero) and a tangent vector at a distance ''L'' away from position 0, along the contour of the chain. It can be shown that the expectation value of the cosine of the angle falls off exponentially with distance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Theory of Polymer Dynamics |first1=M. |last1=Doi |first2=S.F. |last2=Edwards |publisher=Clarendon, Oxford |year=1986 |page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \langle\cos{\theta}\rangle = e^{-(L/P)} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the persistence length and the angled brackets denote the average over all starting positions.

In polymer science jargon, the persistence length is considered to be one half of the [[Kuhn length]], the length of hypothetical segments that the chain can be considered as freely joined. The persistence length equals the average projection of the [[end-to-end vector]] on the tangent to the chain contour at a chain end in the limit of infinite chain length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology |publisher=IUPAC |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/goldbook/P04515.html#search=%22persistence%20length%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The persistence length can be also expressed using the bending stiffness &lt;math&gt; B_s &lt;/math&gt;, the [[Young's modulus]] ''E'' and knowing the section of the polymer
chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cytoskeletal mechanics: models and measurements
 |first=M.R.K. |last=Mofrad |publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr |url=http://books.google.ch/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=HI8xTBUhnuYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Cytoskeletal+mechanics:+models+and+measurements&amp;ots=EQKON4nMwi&amp;sig=lvdjSlj8vTNcPp-70AQJLVscHhU}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  P=\frac{B_s}{k_BT}\, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  B_s=EI\, &lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a rigid and uniform rod ''I'' can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;  I=\frac{\pi a^4}{4}\, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' is the radius.

For example a piece of uncooked [[spaghetti]] has a persistence length on the order of &lt;math&gt;  10^{18} &lt;/math&gt; m (taking in consideration a Young modulus of
5 GPa and a radius of 1&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brittle failure of dry spaghetti
 |first=G. V. |last=Guinea |publisher=Engineering Failure Analysis |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1350630704000123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double-helical [[DNA]] has a persistence length of about 500&amp;nbsp;[[Angstrom]]s. Such large persistent length for spaghetti does not mean that it is not flexible. It just means that its stiffness is such that it needs &lt;math&gt;  10^{18} &lt;/math&gt; m of length for thermal fluctuations at 300K to bend it.

Another example:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=510330&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Imagine a long cord that is slightly flexible. At short distance scales, the cord will basically be rigid. If you look at the direction the cord is pointing at two points that are very close together, the cord will likely be pointing in the same direction at those two points (i.e. the angles of the tangent vectors are highly correlated). If you choose two points on this flexible cord (imagine a piece of cooked spaghetti that you've just tossed on your plate) that are very far apart, however, the tangent to the cords at those locations will likely be pointing in different directions (i.e. the angles will be uncorrelated). If you plot out how correlated the tangent angles at two different points are as a function of the distance between the two points, you'll get a plot that starts out at 1 (perfect correlation) at a distance of zero and drops exponentially as distance increases. The persistence length is the characteristic length scale of that exponential decay.

{{for|the special astrodynamical meaning|Delta-v}}

In general physics, '''delta-''v''''' is simply a change in [[velocity]].  The Greek uppercase letter delta is the standard mathematical symbol to represent change in some quantity.

Depending on the situation, delta-''v'' can be either a [[Euclidean vector|spatial vector]] (Δ'''v''') or [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] (Δ''v''). In either case it is equal to the [[acceleration]] (vector or scalar) integrated over time:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_0 = \int^{t_1}_{t_0} \mathbf {a} \, dt&lt;/math&gt; (vector version)
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta{v} = {v}_1 - {v}_0 = \int^{t_1}_{t_0} {a} \, dt&lt;/math&gt; (scalar version)
where:
*'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is initial velocity (at time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;),
*'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is subsequent velocity (at time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).

Change in velocity is useful in many cases, such as determining the change in [[momentum]], where :&lt;math&gt;\Delta{\mathbf{p}} = m\Delta{\mathbf{v}}&lt;/math&gt;, where ,&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; is momentum and m is mass.

[[File:Half light radius simple.svg|thumb|right|Half light radius ''R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' encloses half of the total light emitted by an object]]
The '''effective radius''' (&lt;math&gt;R_e&lt;/math&gt;) of a [[galaxy]] is the [[radius]] at which half of the total [[light]] of the system is emitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Half-light Radius|url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cms/astro/cosmos/h/Half-light+Radius|publisher=Swinburne University|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=James | last1=Binney | first2=Scott | last2=Tremaine | title=Galactic Dynamics | edition=Second | date=2008 | publisher=Princeton Series in Astrophysics | isbn=9780691130279 | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumes the galaxy has either intrinsic [[circular symmetry|spherical symmetry]] or is at least circularly symmetric as viewed in the plane of the sky. Alternatively, a half-light [[Contour line|contour]], or [[Contour line#Other phenomena|isophote]], may be used for spherically and circularly asymmetric objects.

&lt;math&gt;R_e&lt;/math&gt; is an important length scale in [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs|de Vaucouleurs]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[4] R&lt;/math&gt; [[De Vaucouleurs' law|law]], which characterizes a specific rate at which [[surface brightness]] decreases as a function of radius:

:&lt;math&gt;
I(R) = I_e \cdot e^{-7.67 \left( \sqrt[4]{\frac R {R_e}} - 1 \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_e&lt;/math&gt; is the surface brightness at &lt;math&gt;R = R_e&lt;/math&gt;. At &lt;math&gt;R = 0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
I(R=0) = I_e \cdot e^{7.67} \approx 2000 \cdot I_e
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the central surface brightness is approximately &lt;math&gt;2000 \cdot I_e&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Fuel efficiency''' is a form of [[thermal efficiency]], meaning the efficiency of a process that converts [[chemical energy|chemical]] [[potential energy]] contained in a carrier [[fuel]] into [[kinetic energy]] or [[Mechanical work|work]]. Overall fuel efficiency may vary per device, which in turn may vary per application fuel efficiency, especially [[fossil fuel power plant]]s or industries dealing with [[combustion]], such as [[ammonia]] production during the [[Haber process]].

In the context of [[transport]], fuel economy is the [[energy efficiency in transportation|energy efficiency]] of a particular vehicle,  given as a [[ratio]] of distance traveled per unit of [[Motor fuel|fuel]] consumed.  Fuel economy is expressed in [[mile]]s per [[gallon]] (mpg) in the USA and usually also in the UK ([[Imperial units|imperial]] gallon);there is sometimes confusion as the imperial gallon is 20% larger than the US gallon so that mpg values are not directly comparable. In countries using the [[metric system]] fuel economy is stated in kilometres per litre (km/L) in the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]] and in several [[Latin America]]n or Asian countries such as [[India]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], or as the reciprocal ratio, &quot;fuel consumption&quot; in [[liter]]s per 100 [[kilometers]] (L/100&amp;nbsp;km) in much of Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Litres per [[Scandinavian mile|mil]] are used in [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]].

Fuel consumption is a more accurate measure of a vehicle’s performance because it is a linear relationship while [http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/label/learn-more-gasoline-label.shtml#fuel-consumption-rate fuel economy leads to distortions] in efficiency improvements.

Weight-specific efficiency (efficiency per unit weight) may be stated for [[freight]], and passenger-specific efficiency (vehicle efficiency per passenger).

==Vehicle design==
Fuel efficiency is dependent on many parameters of a vehicle, including its [[engine]] parameters, [[Drag (physics)|aerodynamic drag]], weight, and [[rolling resistance]]. There have been advances in all areas of vehicle design in recent decades.

[[Hybrid vehicles]] use two or more power sources for propulsion. In many designs, a small combustion engine is combined with electric motors.  Kinetic energy which would otherwise be lost to heat during braking is recaptured as electrical power to improve fuel efficiency. Engines automatically shut off when vehicles come to a stop and start again when the accelerator is pressed preventing wasted energy from idling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Hybrid Work|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fleet efficiency==
Fleet efficiency describes the average efficiency of a population of vehicles.  Technological advances in efficiency may be offset by a change in buying habits with a propensity to heavier vehicles, which are less efficient, all else being equal.

==Energy efficiency terminology==
Energy efficiency is similar to fuel efficiency but the input is usually in units of energy such as British thermal units (BTU), megajoules (MJ), gigajoules (GJ), kilocalories (kcal), or kilowatt-hours (kW·h).  The inverse of &quot;energy efficiency&quot; is &quot;energy intensity&quot;, or the amount of input energy required for a unit of output such as MJ/passenger-km (of passenger transport), BTU/ton-mile (of freight transport, for long/short/metric tons), GJ/t (for steel production), BTU/(kW·h) (for electricity generation), or litres/100&amp;nbsp;km (of vehicle travel). Litres per 100&amp;nbsp;km is also a measure of &quot;energy intensity&quot; where the input is measured by the amount of fuel and the output is measured by the [[distance]] travelled.  For example: [[Fuel economy in automobiles]].

Given a heat value of a fuel, it would be trivial to convert from fuel units (such as litres of gasoline) to energy units (such as MJ) and conversely. But there are two problems with comparisons made using energy units:

* There are two different heat values for any hydrogen-containing fuel which can differ by several percent (see below).
* When comparing transportation energy costs, it must be remembered that a [[kilowatt hour]] of electric energy may require an amount of fuel with heating value of 2 or 3 kilowatt hours to produce it.

==Energy content of fuel==
The specific energy content of a fuel is the heat energy obtained when a certain quantity is burned (such as a gallon, litre, kilogram).  It is sometimes called the heat of combustion.  There exists two different values of specific heat energy for the same batch of fuel.  One is the high (or gross) heat of combustion and the other is the low (or net) heat of combustion.  The high value is obtained when, after the combustion, the water in the exhaust is in liquid form.  For the low value, the exhaust has all the water in vapor form (steam).  Since water vapor gives up heat energy when it changes from vapor to liquid, the liquid water value is larger since it includes the latent heat of vaporization of water.  The difference between the high and low values is significant, about 8 or 9%.  This accounts for most of the apparent discrepancy in the heat value of gasoline. In the U.S. (and the table below) the high heat values have traditionally been used, but in many other countries, the low heat values are commonly used.

&lt;!--This table originally contained MJ/L values that were too low compared to the BTU/gal figures, with a reference to an ''Automotive Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;''Automotive Handbook, 4th Edition'', Robert Bosch GmbH, 1996. ISBN 0-8376-0333-1&lt;/ref&gt; These have now been replaced with values from the ''Transportation Energy Data Book'',&lt;ref name=TEDB&gt;[http://www-cta.ornl.gov/data/Appendix_B.html Appendix B, Transportation Energy Data Book] from the [[Center for Transportation Analysis]] of the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]&lt;/ref&gt;
but which does not give the MJ/kg or the densities.)

Note: I modified this table because the values in SI units did not agree with the values in British or U.S. units. So I used another source, but it did not have MJ/kg, and I did not have the time to try to find accurate densities in order to convert to MJ/kg. If someone can fill in the blanks using good data, it would be useful.--&gt;

Neither the gross heat of combustion nor the net heat of combustion gives the theoretical amount of mechanical energy (work) that can be obtained from the reaction. (This is given by the change in [[Gibbs free energy]], and is around 45.7&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg for gasoline.) The actual amount of mechanical work obtained from fuel (the inverse of the [[Brake specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]]) depends on the engine. A figure of 17.6&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg is possible with a gasoline engine, and 19.1&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg for a diesel engine. See [[Brake specific fuel consumption]] for more information.

== Fuel efficiency of vehicles ==
{{See also|Fuel economy in automobiles}}
The fuel efficiency of vehicles can be expressed in more ways:

*'''Fuel consumption''' is the amount of fuel used per unit distance; for example, '''[[litre]]s per 100 [[kilometre]]s (L/100&amp;nbsp;km)'''. In this case, the '''lower''' the value, the more economic a vehicle is (the less fuel it needs to travel a certain distance); this is the measure generally used across Europe (except the UK, Denmark and The Netherlands - see below), New Zealand, Australia and Canada. Also in Uruguay, Paraguay, Guatemala, Colombia, China, and Madagascar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, as also in post-Soviet space.
*'''Fuel economy''' is the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel used; for example, '''kilometres per litre (km/L)''' or '''[[mile]]s per [[gallon]] (MPG)''', where 1 MPG (imperial) ≈ 0.354006&amp;nbsp;km/L.  In this case, the '''higher''' the value, the more economic a vehicle is (the more distance it can travel with a certain volume of fuel). This measure is popular in the USA and the UK (mpg), but in Europe, India, Japan, South Korea and Latin America the metric unit ''km/L'' is used instead.

Converting from mpg or to L/100&amp;nbsp;km (or vice versa) involves the use of the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] function, which is not [[distributive property|distributive]]. Therefore, the average of two fuel economy numbers gives different values if those units are used, because one of the functions is reciprocal, thus not linear. If two people calculate the fuel economy average of two groups of cars with different units, the group with better fuel economy may be one or the other. However, from the point of energy used as a shared method of measure, the result shall be the same in both the cases.

The formula for converting to miles per US gallon (exactly 3.785411784 L) from L/100&amp;nbsp;km is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{235.215}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is value of L/100&amp;nbsp;km. For miles per Imperial gallon (exactly 4.54609 L) the formula is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{282.481}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

In parts of Europe, the two standard measuring cycles for &quot;litre/100 km&quot; value are &quot;urban&quot; traffic with speeds up to 50&amp;nbsp;km/h from a cold start, and then &quot;extra urban&quot; travel at various speeds up to 120&amp;nbsp;km/h which follows the urban test. A combined figure is also quoted showing the total fuel consumed in divided by the total distance traveled in both tests. A reasonably modern European [[supermini car|supermini]] and many mid-size cars, including station wagons, may manage [[motorway]] travel at 5 L/100&amp;nbsp;km (47 mpg US/56 mpg imp) or 6.5 L/100&amp;nbsp;km in city traffic (36 mpg US/43 mpg imp), with [[carbon dioxide]] emissions of around 140 g/km.

An average [[North America]]n [[mid-size car]] travels 21 mpg (US) (11 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) city, 27 mpg (US) (9 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) highway; a [[full-size car|full-size]] [[SUV]] usually travels 13 mpg (US) (18 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) city and 16 mpg (US) (15 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) highway.  [[Pickup truck]]s vary considerably; whereas a 4 cylinder-engined light pickup can achieve 28 mpg (8 L/100&amp;nbsp;km), a [[V8 engine|V8]] full-size pickup with extended cabin only travels 13 mpg (US) (18 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) city and 15 mpg (US) (15 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) highway.

The average fuel economy is higher in Europe due to the higher cost of fuel. In the UK, a gallon of gas without tax would cost US$1.97, but with taxes cost US$6.06 in 2005. The average cost in the United States was US$2.61. Consumers prefer &quot;muscle cars&quot; but choose more fuel efficient ones when gas prices increase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0826/p01s03-woeu.html Gas prices too high? Try Europe.]&lt;/ref&gt;

European-built cars are generally more fuel-efficient than US vehicles. While Europe has many higher efficiency diesel cars, European gasoline vehicles are on average also more efficient than gasoline-powered vehicles in the USA. Most European vehicles cited in the CSI study run on diesel engines, which tend to achieve greater fuel efficiency than gas engines. Selling those cars in the United States is difficult because of emission standards, notes Walter McManus, a fuel economy expert at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. &quot;For the most part, European diesels don’t meet U.S. emission standards&quot;, McManus said in 2007. Another reason why many European models are not marketed in the United States is that labor unions object to having the big 3 import any new foreign built models regardless of fuel economy while laying off workers at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17344368/ EuropeVsUS Efficiency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of European cars' capabilities of fuel economy is the [[microcar]] ''[[Smart Fortwo]]'' cdi, which can achieve up to 3.4 l/100&amp;nbsp;km (69.2 mpg US) using a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] three-cylinder 41&amp;nbsp;bhp (30&amp;nbsp;kW) Diesel engine. The Fortwo is produced by [[Daimler AG]] and is currently only sold by one company in the United States. Furthermore, the current (and to date already 10-year-old) world record in fuel economy of production cars is held by the [[Volkswagen Group]], with special production models (labeled &quot;3L&quot;) of the [[Volkswagen Lupo#Lupo 3L|Volkswagen Lupo]] and the [[Audi A2#1.2 TDI &quot;3L&quot;|Audi A2]], consuming as little as {{convert|3|L/100 km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/consumer/autos/mareview/mauto497.htm VW Lupo: Rough road to fuel economy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diesel engine]]s generally achieve greater fuel efficiency than petrol (gasoline) engines. Passenger car diesel engines have [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of up to 41% but more typically 30%, and petrol engines of up to 37.3%, but more typically 20%. That is one of the reasons why diesels have better fuel efficiency than equivalent petrol cars. A common margin is 25% more miles per gallon for an efficient turbodiesel.

For example, the current model Skoda Octavia, using Volkswagen engines, has a combined European fuel efficiency of 41.3 mpg for the {{convert|105|bhp|abbr=on}} petrol engine and 52.3 mpg for the {{convert|105|bhp|abbr=on}} — and heavier — diesel engine. The higher compression ratio is helpful in raising the energy efficiency, but diesel fuel also contains approximately 10% more energy per unit volume than gasoline which contributes to the reduced fuel consumption for a given power output.

In 2002, the United States had 85,174,776 trucks, and averaged {{convert|13.5|mpgus}}. Large trucks, over {{convert|33,000|lb}}, averaged {{convert|5.7|mpgus}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cta.ornl.gov/data/chapter5.shtml Heavy Vehicles and Characteristics] Table 5.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The average economy of automobiles in the United States in 2002 was {{convert|22.0|mpgus}}. By 2010 this had increased to {{convert|23.0|mpgus}}. Average fuel economy in the United States gradually declined until 1973, when it reached a low of {{convert|13.4|mpgus}} and gradually has increased since, as a result of higher fuel cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cta.ornl.gov/data/chapter4.shtml Light Vehicles and Characteristics] Table 4.1&lt;/ref&gt; A study indicates that a 10% increase in gas prices will eventually produce a 2.04% increase in fuel economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/pol.1.2.113  How Do Gasoline Prices Affect Fleet Fuel Economy?]&lt;/ref&gt; One method by car makers to increase fuel efficiency is [[lightweighting]] in which lighter-weight materials are substituted in for improved engine performance and handling.&lt;ref name=twsMercuryNews&gt;Dee-Ann Durbin of the Associated Press, June 17, 2014, Mercury News, [http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_25981045/auto-industry-gets-serious-about-lighter-materials Auto industry gets serious about lighter materials], Retrieved April 11, 2015, &quot;...Automakers have been experimenting for decades with lightweighting...  the effort is gaining urgency with the adoption of tougher gas mileage standards. ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuel efficiency in microgravity==

How fuel combusts affects how much energy is produced. The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) has investigated fuel consumption in [[microgravity]].

The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on [[convection]], because soot tends to rise to the top of a flame, such as in a candle, making the flame yellow. In microgravity or [[zero gravity]], such as an environment in [[outer space]], convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes [[sphere|spherical]], with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient. There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely one given is the hypothesis that the temperature is evenly distributed enough that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs., National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005. Experiments by NASA in microgravity reveal that [[diffusion flame]]s in microgravity allow more soot to be completely oxidised after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behaved differently in microgravity when compared to normal gravity conditions.[http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/combustion/lsp/lsp1_results.htm LSP-1 experiment results], National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005. [[Premixed flame]]s in microgravity burn at a much slower rate and more efficiently than even a candle on Earth, and last much longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/combustion/lsp/lsp1_results.htm SOFBAL-2 experiment results], National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==

===Fuel efficiency in transportation===
{{Main|Energy efficiency in transportation}}

=== Vehicle efficiency and transportation pollution ===
{{Main|Gas-guzzler|Vehicle Efficiency Initiative}}

Fuel efficiency directly affects emissions causing pollution by affecting the amount of fuel used. However, it also depends on the fuel source used to drive the vehicle concerned. Cars for example, can run on a number of fuel types other than gasoline, such as [[Natural gas vehicle|natural gas]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] or [[biofuel]] or electricity which creates various quantities of atmospheric pollution.

A kilogram of carbon, whether contained in petrol, diesel, kerosene, or any other hydrocarbon fuel in a vehicle, leads to approximately 3.6&amp;nbsp;kg of [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA CO2 est&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Emission Facts: Average Carbon Dioxide Emissions Resulting from Gasoline and Diesel Fuel | url = http://www.epa.gov/OMS/climate/420f05001.htm | publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |date=February 2005 | work = Office of Transportation and Air Quality | accessdate = 2009-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the carbon content of gasoline, its combustion emits 2.3&amp;nbsp;kg/l (19.4&amp;nbsp;lb/US gal) of [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]; since diesel fuel is more energy dense per unit volume, diesel emits 2.6&amp;nbsp;kg/l (22.2&amp;nbsp;lb/US gal).&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA CO2 est&quot; /&gt;  This figure is only the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of the final fuel product and does not include additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions created during the drilling, pumping, transportation and refining steps required to produce the fuel. Additional measures to reduce overall emission includes improvements to the efficiency of [[air conditioner]]s, lights and tires.

===Driving technique===
{{Main|Energy-efficient driving}}

Many drivers have the potential to improve their fuel efficiency significantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beusen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beusen|title=Using on-board logging devices to study the long-term impact of an eco-driving course |journal=Transportation Research D |volume=14 |issue= |pages=514–520 |year=2009 |month= |pmid= |doi= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231614817_Using_on-board_logging_devices_to_study_the_long-term_impact_of_an_eco-driving_course?ev=prf_pub|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/cars-light-trucks/driving/fuel-efficient-driving-techniques/17823 five basic fuel-efficient driving techniques] can be effective.

There is a growing community of enthusiasts known as hypermilers who develop and practice driving techniques to increase fuel efficiency and reduce consumption. Hypermilers have broken records of fuel efficiency, for example, achieving 109 miles per gallon in a [[Prius]]. In non-hybrid vehicles these techniques are also beneficial, with fuel efficiencies of up to 59 MPG in a [[Honda Accord]] or 30 MPG in an [[Acura MDX]].&lt;ref name=&quot;This Guy Can Get 59 MPG in a Plain Old Accord. Beat That, Punk.&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaffney|first=Dennis|title=This Guy Can Get 59 MPG in a Plain Old Accord. Beat That, Punk.|publisher=Mother Jones|date=2007-01-01|url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/01/king_of_the_hypermilers.html|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advanced technology improvements to improve fuel efficiency==
The most efficient machines for converting energy to rotary motion are electric motors, as used in [[electric vehicles]]. However, electricity is not a primary energy source so the efficiency of the electricity production has also to be taken into account. Currently [[railway]] trains can be powered using electricity, delivered through an additional running rail, overhead [[overhead lines|catenary]] system or by on-board generators used in [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] locomotives as common on the UK rail network. Pollution produced from centralised generation of electricity is emitted at a distant power station, rather than &quot;on site&quot;. Some railways, such as the French SNCF and Swiss federal railways derive most, if not 100% of their power, from hydroelectric or nuclear power stations, therefore atmospheric pollution from their rail networks is very low. This was reflected in a study by AEA Technology between a [[Eurostar]] train and airline journeys between London and Paris, which showed the trains on average emitting 10 times less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, per passenger, than planes, helped in part by French nuclear generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transportenvironment.org/Article267.html European Federation for Transport and Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be changed using more [[renewable energy|renewable sources]] for [[electric generation]].

In the future, [[hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen cars]] may be commercially available. Toyota is test marketing hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles in southern California where a series of hydrogen fueling stations has been established. Powered either through chemical reactions in a [[fuel cell]] that create electricity to drive very efficient electrical motors or by directly burning hydrogen in a combustion engine (near identically to a [[natural gas vehicle]], and similarly compatible with both natural gas and gasoline); these vehicles promise to have near-zero pollution from the tailpipe (exhaust pipe). Potentially the atmospheric pollution could be minimal, provided the hydrogen is made by [[electrolysis]] using electricity from non-polluting sources such as solar, wind or [[hydroelectricity]] or thermochemically by the use of the [[Thorium fuel cycle]] in a [[molten salt reactor]].

Because there are pollutants involved in the manufacture and destruction of a car and the production, transmission and storage of electricity and hydrogen, the use of the label &quot;zero pollution&quot; should be understood as applying only to the car's conversion of stored energy into transportation.

In 2004, a consortium of major auto-makers — [[BMW]], [[General Motors]], [[Honda]], [[Toyota]] and [[Volkswagen]]/[[Audi]] — came up with ''&quot;Top Tier Detergent Gasoline Standard&quot;'' to [[gasoline]] brands in the US and Canada that meet their minimum standards for [[detergent]] content&lt;ref name=&quot;Top Tier Gasoline&quot;&gt;[http://www.toptiergas.com/retailers.html Top Tier Gasoline]&lt;/ref&gt; and do not contain metallic additives. Top Tier gasoline contains higher levels of detergent additives in order to prevent the build-up of deposits (typically, on [[fuel injector]] and [[intake valve]]) known to reduce fuel economy and engine performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Tristimulus colorimeter ===
{{main|Tristimulus colorimeter}}
In [[digital imaging]], colorimeters are tristimulus devices used for [[color calibration]]. Accurate [[ICC Profile|color profiles]] ensure consistency throughout the imaging workflow, from acquisition to output.

=== Spectroradiometer, spectrophotometer, spectrocolorimeter ===
The absolute [[spectral power distribution]] of a light source can be measured with a ''spectroradiometer'', which works by optically collecting the light, then passing it through a [[monochromator]] before reading it in narrow bands of wavelength.

Reflected color can be measured using a ''spectrophotometer'' (also called ''spectroreflectometer'' or ''reflectometer''), which takes measurements in the visible region (and a little beyond) of a given color sample. If the custom of taking readings at 10 [[nanometer]] increments is followed, the [[visible light]] range of 400-700&amp;nbsp;nm will yield 31 readings. These readings are typically used to draw the sample's [[reflectivity|spectral reflectance]] curve (how much it reflects, as a function of wavelength)—the most accurate data that can be provided regarding its characteristics.

[[Image:CRT phosphors.png|thumb|CRT phosphors]]
The readings by themselves are typically not as useful as their [[tristimulus]] values, which can be converted into [[chromaticity]] co-ordinates and manipulated through [[color translation|color space transformations]].  For this purpose, a ''spectrocolorimeter'' may be used. A spectrocolorimeter is simply a spectrophotometer that can estimate tristimulus values by [[numerical integration]] (of the [[color matching function]]s' [[inner product]] with the illuminant's spectral power distribution).&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt; One benefit of spectrocolorimeters over tristimulus colorimeters is that they do not have optical filters, which are subject to manufacturing variance, and have a fixed spectral transmittance curve—until they age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorimeter vs. Spectro|volume=2|issue=3|work=Colorsync-users Digest|accessdate=2008-05-06|author=Andreas Brant, GretagMacbeth Corporate Support|date=2005-01-07|url=http://lists.apple.com/archives/Colorsync-users/2005/Jan/msg00118.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, tristimulus colorimeters are purpose-built, cheaper, and easier to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorimeter vs. Spectro|volume=2|issue=3|work=Colorsync-users Digest|accessdate=2008-05-06|author=Raymond Cheydleur, X-Rite|date=2005-01-08|url=http://lists.apple.com/archives/Colorsync-users/2005/Jan/msg00120.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE (International Commission on Illumination)]] recommends using measurement intervals under 5&amp;nbsp;nm, even for smooth spectra.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; Sparser measurements fail to accurately characterize spiky emission spectra, such as that of the red phosphor of a CRT display, depicted aside.

[[Photographer]]s and [[cinematographer]]s use information provided by these meters to decide what [[Color balance|color balancing]] should be done to make different light sources appear to have the same color temperature. If the user enters the reference color temperature, the meter can calculate the [[mired]] difference between the measurement and the reference, enabling the user to choose a corrective [[color gel]] or [[photographic filter]] with the closest mired factor.&lt;ref name=fpe&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Salvaggio|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography: Digital Imaging, Theory and Application|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|editor=Michael R.

Internally the meter is typically a [[silicon photodiode]] tristimulus colorimeter.&lt;ref name=fpe/&gt; The [[correlated color temperature]] can be calculated from the tristimulus values by first calculating the [[chromaticity]] co-ordinates in the [[CIE 1960 color space]], then finding the closest point on the [[Planckian locus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8386">In [[physics]] and [[engineering]], '''mass flux''' is the rate of [[mass]] flow per unit area, perfectly overlapping with the '''momentum density''', the [[momentum]] per unit volume. The common symbols are ''j'', ''J'', ''q'', ''Q'', ''φ'', or ''Φ'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] lower or capital [[Phi]]), sometimes with subscript ''m'' to indicate mass is the flowing quantity. Its [[SI units]] are kg s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Mass flux can also refer to an alternate form of flux in [[Fick's law]] that includes the [[molecular mass]], or in [[Darcy's law]] that includes the mass [[density]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.maths.org/mmkb/entry.html?action=entryById&amp;id=2113|title=Thesaurus: Mass flux|accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Unfortunately, sometimes the defining equation for mass flux in this article is used interchangeably with the defining equation in [[mass flow rate]]. For example, ''Fluid Mechanics, Schaum's et al'' &lt;ref&gt;Fluid Mechanics, M. Potter, D.C. Wiggart, Schuam's outlines, McGraw Hill (USA), 2008, ISBN 978-0-07-148781-8&lt;/ref&gt; uses the definition of mass flux as the equation in the mass flow rate article.

==Definition==

Mathematically, mass flux is defined as the [[limit of a function|limit]]:

:&lt;math&gt;j_m = \lim\limits_{A \rightarrow 0}\frac{I_m}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;I_m = \lim\limits_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t} = \frac{dm}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

is the mass current (flow of mass ''m'' per unit time ''t'') and ''A'' is the area through which the mass flows through.

For mass flux as a vector '''j'''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[surface integral]] it over a [[surface]] ''S'', followed by an integral over the time duration ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, gives the total amount of mass flowing through the surface in that time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;m=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\iint_S \bold{j}_m\cdot\bold{\hat{n}}{\rm d}A{\rm d}t &lt;/math&gt;

The [[area]] required to calculate the flux is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. 

For example, for substances passing through a [[filter paper|filter]] or a [[Artificial membrane|membrane]], the real surface is the (generally curved) surface area of the filter, [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopically]] - ignoring the area spanned by the holes in the filter/membrane. The spaces would be cross-sectional areas. For liquids passing through a pipe, the area is the cross-section of the pipe, at the section considered.

The [[vector area]] is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the mass passes through, ''A'', and a [[unit vector]] normal to the area, &lt;math&gt;\bold{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. The relation is &lt;math&gt;\bold{A} = A \bold{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. 

If the mass flux '''j'''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; passes through the area at an angle θ to the area normal &lt;math&gt;\bold{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{j}_m\cdot\bold{\hat{n}}= j_m\cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

where '''·''' is the [[dot product]] of the unit vectors. This is, the component of mass flux passing through the surface (i.e. normal to it) is ''j&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' cos θ, while the component of mass flux passing tangential to the area is ''j&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' sin θ, but there is ''no'' mass flux actually passing ''through'' the area in the tangential direction. The ''only'' component of mass flux passing normal to the area is the cosine component.

===Example===

Consider a pipe of flowing [[water]]. Suppose the pipe has a constant cross section and we consider a straight section of it (not at any bends/junctions), and the water is flowing steadily at a constant rate, under [[standard conditions]]. The area ''A'' is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. Suppose the pipe has radius ''r'' = 2&amp;nbsp;cm = 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; m. The area is then 
:&lt;math&gt;A = \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;
To calculate the mass flux ''j&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' (magnitude), we also need the amount of mass of water transferred through the area and the time taken. Suppose a volume ''V'' = 1.5 L = 1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; passes through in time ''t'' = 2 s. Assuming the [[Properties of water#Density of water and ice|density of water]] is ''ρ'' = 1000&amp;nbsp;kg m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp; \Delta m = \rho \Delta V \\
&amp; m_2 - m_1 = \rho ( V_2 - V_1) \\
&amp; m = \rho V \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

(since initial volume passing through the area was zero, final is ''V'', so corresponding mass is ''m''), so the mass flux is

:&lt;math&gt;j_m = \frac{\Delta m}{ A \Delta t} = \frac{\rho V}{ \pi r^2 t} &lt;/math&gt;

substituting the numbers gives:

&lt;math&gt; j_m = \frac{1000 \times (1.5 \times 10^{-3})}{ \pi \times (2 \times 10^{-2})^2 \times 2} = \frac{3}{16\pi}\times 10^4 &lt;/math&gt;

which is approximately 596.8&amp;nbsp;kg s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Equations for fluids==

===Alternative equation===

Using the vector definition, mass flux is also equal to:&lt;ref&gt;Vectors, Tensors, and the basic Equations of Fluid Mechanics, R. Aris, Dover Publications, 1989, ISBN(10) 0-486-66110-5&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{j}_{\rm m} = \rho \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''ρ'' = mass density,
* '''u''' = [[velocity field]] of mass elements flowing (i.e. at each point in space the velocity of an element of matter is some velocity vector '''u''').

Sometimes this equation may be used to define '''j'''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; as a vector.

===Mass and molar fluxes for composite fluids===

====Mass fluxes====

In the case fluid is not pure, i.e. is a [[mixture]] of substances (technically contains a number of component substances), the mass fluxes must be considered separately for each component of the mixture. 

When describing fluid flow (i.e. flow of matter), mass flux is appropriate. When describing particle transport (movement of a large number of particles), it is useful to use an analogous quantity, called the '''molar flux'''. 

Using mass, the mass flux of component ''i'' is: 

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{j}_{{\rm m}, \, i} = \rho_i \mathbf{u}_i &lt;/math&gt;

The '''barycentric mass flux''' of component ''i'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{j}_{{\rm m}, \, i} = \rho \left ( \mathbf{u}_i - \langle \mathbf{u} \rangle \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \langle \mathbf{u} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the [[average]] '''mass velocity''' of all the components in the mixture, given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \mathbf{u} \rangle = \frac{1}{\rho}\sum_i \rho_i \mathbf{u}_i = \frac{1}{\rho}\sum_i \mathbf{j}_{{\rm m}, \, i} &lt;/math&gt;

where :

* ''ρ'' = mass density of the entire mixture,
* ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = mass density of component ''i'',
* '''u''' ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = velocity of component ''i''.

The average is taken over the velocities of the components.

====Molar fluxes====

If we replace density ''ρ'' by the [[number of moles]] ''n'', we have the '''molar flux''' analogues.

The molar flux is the number of moles per unit time per unit area, generally: 

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{j}_{\rm n} = n \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

So the molar flux of component ''i'' is (number of moles per unit time per unit area): 

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{j}_{{\rm n}, \, i} = n_i \mathbf{u}_i &lt;/math&gt;

and the '''barycentric molar flux''' of component ''i'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{j}_{{\rm n}, \, i} = n \left ( \mathbf{u}_i - \langle \mathbf{u} \rangle \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \langle \mathbf{u} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; this time is the [[average]] '''molar velocity''' of all the components in the mixture, given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \mathbf{u} \rangle = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i n_i \mathbf{u}_i = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i \mathbf{j}_{{\rm n}, \, i} &lt;/math&gt;

==Usage==

Mass flux appears in some equations in [[hydrodynamics]], in particular the [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\bold{j}_{\rm m} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=0&lt;/math&gt;

which is a statement of the mass conservation of fluid. In hydrodynamics, mass can only flow from one place to another.

Molar flux occurs in [[Fick's laws of diffusion#Fick's first law|Fick's first law]] of [[diffusion]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\bold{j}_{\rm n} = -\nabla \cdot D \nabla c &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' is the [[diffusion coefficient]]  and ''c'' is the [[concentration]] of substance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7670">The '''mass attenuation coefficient''' or '''mass narrow beam attenuation coefficient''' of the volume of a material characterizes how easily it can be penetrated by a beam of [[light]], [[sound]], [[particle]]s, or other [[energy]] or [[matter]].&lt;ref name=GoldBook&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Attenuation coefficient|file=A00516|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to visible light, mass attenuation coefficients can be defined for other [[electromagnetic radiation]] (such as [[X-ray]]s), [[sound]], or any other beam that attenuates. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of mass attenuation coefficient is the square metre per [[kilogram]] ({{nobreak|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/kg}}). Other common units include cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g (the most common unit for X-ray mass attenuation coefficients) and mL⋅g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (sometimes used in solution chemistry). &quot;Mass extinction coefficient&quot; is an old term for this quantity.&lt;ref name=GoldBook /&gt;

The mass attenuation coefficient can be thought of as a variant of [[absorption cross section]] where the effective area is defined per unit mass instead of per particle.

==Mathematical definitions==

===Mass attenuation coefficient===
'''Mass attenuation coefficient''' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu}{\rho_m},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''μ'' is the [[attenuation coefficient]];
*''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[mass density]].

===Mass absorption and scattering coefficients===
When a narrow ([[Collimated light|collimated]]) beam passes through a volume, the beam will lose intensity due to two processes: [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[scattering]].

'''Mass absorption coefficient''', and '''mass scattering coefficient''' are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu_\mathrm{a}}{\rho_m},\quad \frac{\mu_\mathrm{s}}{\rho_m},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''μ''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the absorption coefficient;
*''μ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the scattering coefficient.

===In solutions===
In chemistry, mass attenuation coefficients are often used for a [[chemical species]] dissolved in a [[solution]]. In that case, the mass attenuation coefficient is defined by the same equation, except that the &quot;density&quot; is the density of only that one chemical species, and the &quot;attenuation&quot; is the attenuation due to only that one chemical species. The ''actual'' [[attenuation coefficient]] is computed by
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = (\mu/\rho_1) \rho_1 + (\mu/\rho_2) \rho_2 + \ldots,&lt;/math&gt;
where each term in the sum is the mass attenuation coefficient and density of a different component of the solution (the [[solvent]] must also be included). This is a convenient concept because the mass attenuation coefficient of a species is approximately independent of its concentration (as long as [[Beer-Lambert law#Prerequisites|certain assumptions]] are fulfilled).

A closely related concept is [[molar absorptivity]]. They are quantitatively related by
:(mass attenuation coefficient) × ([[molar mass]]) = (molar absorptivity).

==Mass attenuation coefficients for X-rays==
[[File:Attenuation Coefficient Iron.svg|thumb|right|400px|'''Mass attenuation coefficient''' of iron with contributing sources of attenuation: [[Rayleigh Scattering|Coherent scattering]], [[Compton Scattering|Incoherent scattering]], [[Photoelectric Effect|Photoelectric Absorption]], and two types of [[Pair Production]]. The discontinuity of [[Photoelectric Effect|photoelectric absorption]] values are due to [[K-edge]]. Graph data came from [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]'s XCOM database.]]
[[File:Photon Mass Attenuation Coefficients.png|thumb|right|400px|'''Mass attenuation coefficient''' values shown for all elements with [[atomic number]] Z smaller than 100 collected for photons with energies from 1 keV to 20 MeV.

Tables of [[photon]] '''mass attenuation coefficients''' are essential in [[radiological]] physics, [[radiography]] (for medical and security purposes), [[dosimetry]], [[diffraction]], [[interferometry]], [[crystallography]] and other branches of physics. The photons can be in form of [[X-ray]], [[gamma-ray]], and [[bremsstrahlung]].

The values of mass attenuation coefficients are dependent upon the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[scattering]] of the [[incident ray|incident]] radiation caused by several different mechanisms such as
*[[Rayleigh scattering]] (coherent scattering);
*[[Compton scattering]] (incoherent scattering);
*[[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric absorption]];
*[[pair production]], electron-positron production in the fields of the nucleus and atomic electrons.

The actual values have been thoroughly examined and are available to the general public through three databases run by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST):

==Calculating the composition of a solution==
If several known chemicals are dissolved in a single solution, the concentrations of each can be calculated using a light absorption analysis. First, the mass attenuation coefficients of each individual solute or solvent, ideally across a broad spectrum of wavelengths, must be measured or looked up. Second, the attenuation coefficient of the actual solution must be measured. Finally, using the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = (\mu/\rho_1) \rho_1 + (\mu/\rho_2) \rho_2 + \ldots,&lt;/math&gt;
the spectrum can be fitted using ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … as adjustable parameters, since ''μ'' and each {{nobreak|''μ''/''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are functions of wavelength. If there are ''N'' solutes or solvents, this procedure requires ''at least'' ''N'' measured wavelengths to create a solvable system of [[simultaneous equations]], although using more wavelengths gives more reliable data.

Specific gravity usually means relative density with respect to water. The term &quot;relative density&quot; is often preferred in modern scientific usage. It is defined as a ratio of density of particular substance with that of water.

If a substance's relative density is less than one then it is less dense than the reference; if greater than 1 then it is denser than the reference. If the relative density is exactly 1 then the densities are equal; that is, equal volumes of the two substances have the same mass.  If the reference material is water then a substance with a relative density (or specific gravity) less than 1 will float in water. For example, an ice cube, with a relative density of about 0.91, will float. A substance with a relative density greater than 1 will sink.

Temperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference. Pressure is nearly always 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (101.325 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]). Where it is not, it is more usual to specify the density directly. Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry. In British brewing practice the specific gravity as specified above is multiplied by 1000.&lt;ref name=briggs&gt;Hough, J.S., Briggs, D.E., Stevens, R and Young, T.W. Malting and Brewing Science, Vol. II Hopped Wort and Beer, Chapman and Hall, London, 1991, p. 881&lt;/ref&gt; Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as [[brine]]s, [[sugar]] solutions ([[syrup]]s, juices, honeys, brewers [[wort]], [[must]], etc.) and acids.

==Basic formulas==
Relative density (''RD'') or specific gravity (''SG'') is a [[dimensionless quantity]], as it is the ratio of either densities or weights

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathit{RD} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{substance}}{\rho_\mathrm{reference}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''RD'' is relative density, ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;substance&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the density of the substance being measured, and ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;reference&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the density of the reference. (By convention ''ρ'', the Greek letter [[Rho (letter)|rho]], denotes density.)

The reference material can be indicated using subscripts: ''RD''&lt;sub&gt;substance/reference&lt;/sub&gt;, which means &quot;the relative density of ''substance'' with respect to ''reference''&quot;. If the reference is not explicitly stated then it is normally assumed to be [[water]] at 4&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] (or, more precisely, 3.98&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]], which is the temperature at which water reaches its maximum density). In [[International System of Units|SI]] units, the density of water is (approximately) 1000&amp;nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]]/[[Cubic metre|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]] or 1&amp;nbsp;[[Gram|g]]/[[Cubic centimetre|cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], which makes relative density calculations particularly convenient: the density of the object only needs to be divided by 1000 or 1, depending on the units.

The relative density of gases is often measured with respect to dry [[air]] at a temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C and a pressure of 101.325 kPa absolute, which has a density of 1.205&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Relative density with respect to air can be obtained by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathit{RD} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{gas}}{\rho_{\mathrm{air}}} \approx \frac{M_\mathrm{gas}}{M_{\mathrm{air}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] and the approximately equal sign is used because equality pertains only if 1 [[Mole (unit)|mol]] of the gas and 1&amp;nbsp;mol of air occupy the same volume at a given temperature and pressure i.e. they are both [[Ideal gas]]es. Ideal behaviour is usually only seen at very low pressure. For example, one mol of an ideal gas occupies 22.414 L at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 atmosphere whereas [[carbon dioxide]] has a molar volume of 22.259 L under those same conditions.

==Temperature dependence==
:''See [[Density]] for a table of the measured densities of water at various temperatures.''

The density of substances varies with temperature and pressure so that it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or masses were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at nominally 1 atmosphere (101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa the variations caused by changing weather patterns) but as relative density usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products) variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent relative density is being measured. For true (''in vacuo'') relative density calculations air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation ''T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;)'' with ''T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and ''T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example SG (20&amp;nbsp;°C/4&amp;nbsp;°C) would be understood to mean that the density of the sample was determined at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and of the water at 4&amp;nbsp;°C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures we note that while SG&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.000000 (20&amp;nbsp;°C/20&amp;nbsp;°C) it is also the case that RD&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.998203/0.998840 = 0.998363 (20&amp;nbsp;°C/4&amp;nbsp;°C). Here temperature is being specified using the current [[ITS-90]] scale and the densities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bettin, H.; Spieweck, F.:|title=Die Dichte des Wassers als Funktion der Temperatur nach Einführung des Internationalen Temperaturskala von 1990|publisher=PTB=Mitt. 100|year=1990|pages=195–196|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; used here and in the rest of this article are based on that scale. On the previous IPTS-68 scale the densities at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 4&amp;nbsp;°C are, respectively, 0.9982071 and 0.9999720 resulting in an RD (20&amp;nbsp;°C/4&amp;nbsp;°C) value for water of 0.9982343.

The temperatures of the two materials may be explicitly stated in the density symbols; for example:
:relative density: &lt;math&gt; 8.15_{4^\circ \mathrm{C}}^{20^\circ \mathrm{C}} \,&lt;/math&gt; or specific gravity: &lt;math&gt; 2.432_0^{15} &lt;/math&gt;
where the superscript indicates the temperature at which the density of the material is measured, and the subscript indicates the temperature of the reference substance to which it is compared.

==Uses==
Relative density can also help quantify the [[buoyancy]] of a substance in a [[fluid]], or determine the density of an unknown substance from the known density of another. Relative density is often used by [[Geology|geologists]] and [[Mineralogy|mineralogists]] to help determine the [[mineral]] content of a rock or other sample. [[Gemology|Gemologists]] use it as an aid in the identification of [[gemstone]]s. Water is preferred as the reference because measurements are then easy to carry out in the field (see below for examples of measurement methods).

As the principal use of relative density measurements in industry is determination of the concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and these are found in tables of RD vs concentration it is extremely important that the analyst enter the table with the correct form of relative density. For example, in the brewing industry, the [[Plato scale|Plato table]], which lists sucrose concentration by mass against true RD, were originally (20&amp;nbsp;°C/4&amp;nbsp;°C)&lt;ref&gt;ASBC Methods of Analysis Preface to Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer, American Society of Brewing Chemists, St Paul, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; that is based on measurements of the density of sucrose solutions made at laboratory temperature (20&amp;nbsp;°C) but referenced to the density of water at 4&amp;nbsp;°C which is very close to the temperature at which water has its maximum density of ''ρ''({{chem|H|2|O}}) equal to 0.999972&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (or 62.43&amp;nbsp;lb&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;·ft&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). The [[American Society of Brewing Chemists|ASBC]] table&lt;ref&gt;ASBC Methods of Analysis ''op. cit.'' Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer&lt;/ref&gt; in use today in North America, while it is derived from the original Plato table is for apparent relative density measurements at (20&amp;nbsp;°C/20&amp;nbsp;°C) on the IPTS-68 scale where the density of water is 0.9982071&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries sucrose concentration by mass is taken from this work&lt;ref name=briggs/&gt; which uses SG (17.5&amp;nbsp;°C/17.5&amp;nbsp;°C). As a final example, the British RD units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60&amp;nbsp;°F and are thus (15.56&amp;nbsp;°C/15.56&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=briggs/&gt;

==Measurement==
Relative density can be calculated directly by measuring the density of a sample and dividing it by the (known) density of the reference substance. The density of the sample is simply its mass divided by its volume. Although mass is easy to measure, the volume of an irregularly shaped sample can be more difficult to ascertain. One method is to put the sample in a water-filled [[graduated cylinder]] and read off how much water it displaces. Alternatively the container can be filled to the brim, the sample immersed, and the volume of overflow measured. The [[surface tension]] of the water may keep a significant amount of water from overflowing, which is especially problematic for small samples. For this reason it is desirable to use a water container with as small a mouth as possible.

For each substance, the density, ''ρ'', is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}
 = \frac{\text{Deflection} \times \frac{\text{Spring Constant}}{\text{Gravity}}}{\text{Displacement}_\mathrm{Water Line} \times \text{Area}_\mathrm{Cylinder}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

When these densities are divided, references to the spring constant, gravity and cross-sectional area simply cancel, leaving

:&lt;math&gt;
RD=\frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}}{\rho_\mathrm{ref}}
= \frac{\frac{\text{Deflection}_\mathrm{Obj.}}{\text{Displacement}_\mathrm{Obj.}}}{\frac{\text{Deflection}_\mathrm{Ref.}}{\text{Displacement}_\mathrm{Ref.}}}
 = \frac{\frac{3\ \mathrm{in}}{20\ \mathrm{mm}}}{\frac{5\ \mathrm{in}}{34\ \mathrm{mm}}}=\frac{3\ \mathrm{in} \times 34\ \mathrm{mm}}{5\ \mathrm{in} \times 20\ \mathrm{mm}} = 1.02\,
&lt;/math&gt;

===Hydrostatic weighing===
{{main|Hydrostatic weighing}}
Relative density is more easily and perhaps more accurately measured without measuring volume. Using a spring scale, the sample is weighed first in air and then in water. Relative density (with respect to water) can then be calculated using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;
RD = \frac{W_\mathrm{air}}{W_\mathrm{air} - W_\mathrm{water}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''W''&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; is the weight of the sample in air (measured in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, [[pound-force|pounds-force]] or some other unit of force)
:''W''&lt;sub&gt;water&lt;/sub&gt; is the weight of the sample in water (measured in the same units).

This technique cannot easily be used to measure relative densities less than one, because the sample will then float. ''W''&lt;sub&gt;water&lt;/sub&gt; becomes a negative quantity, representing the force needed to keep the sample underwater.

Another practical method uses three measurements. The sample is weighed dry. Then a container filled to the brim with water is weighed, and weighed again with the sample immersed, after the displaced water has overflowed and been removed. Subtracting the last reading from the sum of the first two readings gives the weight of the displaced water. The relative density result is the dry sample weight divided by that of the displaced water. This method works with scales that can't easily accommodate a suspended sample, and also allows for measurement of samples that are less dense than water.

===Hydrometer===
{{main|hydrometer}}
[[File:Hydro.PNG|right|300px]]
The relative density of a liquid can be measured using a hydrometer. This consists of a bulb attached to a stalk of constant cross-sectional area, as shown in the diagram to the right.

First the hydrometer is floated in the reference liquid (shown in light blue), and the [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] (the level of the liquid on the stalk) is marked (blue line). The reference could be any liquid, but in practice it is usually water.

The hydrometer is then floated in a liquid of unknown density (shown in green). The change in displacement, Δ''x'', is noted. In the example depicted, the hydrometer has dropped slightly in the green liquid; hence its density is lower than that of the reference liquid. It is, of course, necessary that the hydrometer floats in both liquids.

The application of simple physical principles allows the relative density of the unknown liquid to be calculated from the change in displacement. (In practice the stalk of the hydrometer is pre-marked with graduations to facilitate this measurement.)

In the explanation that follows,

:'''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is the known density ([[mass]] per unit [[volume]]) of the reference liquid (typically water).
:'''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the unknown density of the new (green) liquid.
:'''''RD''&lt;sub&gt;new/ref&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the relative density of the new liquid with respect to the reference.
:'''''V''''' is the volume of reference liquid displaced, i.e. the red volume in the diagram.
:'''''m''''' is the mass of the entire hydrometer.
:'''''g''''' is the [[Earth's gravity|local gravitational constant]].
:'''''Δx''''' is the change in displacement. In accordance with the way in which hydrometers are usually graduated, Δ''x'' is here taken to be negative if the displacement line rises on the stalk of the hydrometer, and positive if it falls. In the example depicted, Δ''x'' is negative.
:'''''A''''' is the cross sectional area of the shaft.

Since the floating hydrometer is in [[static equilibrium]], the downward gravitational force acting upon it must exactly balance the upward buoyancy force. The gravitational force acting on the hydrometer is simply its weight, ''mg''. From the [[Archimedes]] [[buoyancy]] principle, the buoyancy force acting on the hydrometer is equal to the weight of liquid displaced. This weight is equal to the mass of liquid displaced multiplied by ''g'', which in the case of the reference liquid is ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;Vg''. Setting these equal, we have

:&lt;math&gt;mg = \rho_\mathrm{ref}Vg\,&lt;/math&gt;

or just

&lt;!-- these nasty tables are the only way I can find to get the equation number to align properly. Something like &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(2)&lt;/div&gt; doesn't work properly. --&gt;
:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%
|-
|&lt;math&gt;m = \rho_\mathrm{ref} V\,&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;|(1)
|}

Exactly the same equation applies when the hydrometer is floating in the liquid being measured, except that the new volume is ''V''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''A''Δ''x'' (see note above about the sign of Δ''x''). Thus,

:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%
|-
|&lt;math&gt;m = \rho_\mathrm{new} (V - A \Delta x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;|(2)
|}

Combining (1) and (2) yields

:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%
|-
|&lt;math&gt;RD_{\mathrm{new/ref}} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{new}}{\rho_\mathrm{ref}} = \frac{V}{V - A \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;|(3)
|}

But from (1) we have ''V'' = ''m''/''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;. Substituting into (3) gives

:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%
|-
|&lt;math&gt;RD_{\mathrm{new/ref}} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{A \Delta x}{m} \rho_\mathrm{ref}}&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;|(4)
|}

This equation allows the relative density to be calculated from the change in displacement, the known density of the reference liquid, and the known properties of the hydrometer. If Δ''x'' is small then, as a [[Orders of approximation|first-order approximation]] of the [[geometric series]] equation (4) can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;RD_\mathrm{new/ref} \approx 1 + \frac{A \Delta x}{m} \rho_\mathrm{ref} &lt;/math&gt;

This shows that, for small Δ''x'', changes in displacement are approximately proportional to changes in relative density.

===Pycnometer===
[[File:PycnometerEmpty.jpg|thumb|upright|An empty glass pycnometer and stopper]]
[[File:Pycnometer full.jpg|thumb|upright|A filled pycnometer]]
A '''pycnometer''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: πυκνός (puknos) meaning &quot;dense&quot;), also called '''pyknometer''' or '''specific gravity bottle''', is a device used to determine the [[density]] of a liquid.  A pycnometer is usually made of [[glass]], with a close-fitting [[ground glass joint|ground glass]] [[stopper (plug)|stopper]] with a [[capillary tube]] through it, so that air bubbles may escape from the apparatus.  This device enables a liquid's density to be measured accurately by reference to an appropriate working fluid, such as [[water]] or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], using an [[analytical balance]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

If the flask is weighed empty, full of water, and full of a liquid whose relative density is desired, the relative density of the liquid can easily be calculated. The [[particle density]] of a powder, to which the usual method of weighing cannot be applied, can also be determined with a pycnometer. The powder is added to the pycnometer, which is then weighed, giving the weight of the powder sample.  The pycnometer is then filled with a liquid of known density, in which the powder is completely insoluble.  The weight of the displaced liquid can then be determined, and hence the relative density of the powder.

There is also a gas-based manifestation of a pycnometer known as a ''[[gas pycnometer]]''. It compares the change in pressure caused by a measured change in a closed volume containing a reference (usually a steel sphere of known volume) with the change in pressure caused by the sample under the same conditions.  The difference in change of pressure represents the volume of the sample as compared to the reference sphere, and is usually used for solid particulates that may dissolve in the liquid medium of the pycnometer design described above, or for porous materials into which the liquid would not fully penetrate.

When a pycnometer is filled to a specific, but not necessarily accurately known volume, ''V'' and is placed upon a balance, it will exert a force

:&lt;math&gt; F_b = g(m_b - \rho_a{m_b\over \rho_b}) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of the bottle and ''g'' the [[gravitational acceleration]] at the location at which the measurements are being made. ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of the air at the ambient pressure and ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of the material of which the bottle is made (usually glass) so that the second term is the mass of air displaced by the glass of the bottle whose weight, by [[Archimedes' principle#Archimedes' principle|Archimedes Principle]] must be subtracted. The bottle is, of course, filled with air but as that air displaces an equal amount of air the weight of that air is canceled by the weight of the air displaced. Now we fill the bottle with the reference fluid e.g. pure water. The force exerted on the pan of the balance becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; F_w = g(m_b - \rho_a{m_b\over \rho_b} + V\rho_w - V\rho_a). &lt;/math&gt;

If we subtract the force measured on the empty bottle from this (or tare the balance before making the water measurement) we obtain.

:&lt;math&gt;F_{w,n} = gV( \rho_w - \rho_a) &lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript n indicated that this force is net of the force of the empty bottle. The bottle is now emptied, thoroughly dried and refilled with the sample. The force, net of the empty bottle, is now:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{s,n} = gV(\rho_s - \rho_a) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of the sample. The ratio of the sample and water forces is:

:&lt;math&gt;SG_A = {gV(\rho_s - \rho_a) \over gV( \rho_w - \rho_a)} = {( \rho_s - \rho_a) \over ( \rho_w - \rho_a)}. &lt;/math&gt;

This is called the Apparent Relative Density, denoted by subscript A, because it is what we would obtain if we took the ratio of net weighings in air from an analytical balance or used a [[hydrometer]] (the stem displaces air). Note that the result does not depend on the calibration of the balance. The only requirement on it is that it read linearly with force. Nor does ''RD&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' depend on the actual volume of the pycnometer.

Further manipulation and finally substitution of ''RD&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'', the true relative density (the subscript V is used because this is often referred to as the relative density ''in vacuo''), for ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; gives the relationship between apparent and true relative density.

:&lt;math&gt;RD_A= {{\rho_s \over \rho_w}-{\rho_a \over \rho_w} \over 1 - {\rho_a \over \rho_w}} ={RD_V-{\rho_a \over \rho_w} \over 1 - {\rho_a \over \rho_w}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the usual case we will have measured weights and want the true relative denstiy. This is found from

:&lt;math&gt;RD_V = RD_A - {\rho_a \over \rho_w }(RD_A-1)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the density of dry air at 101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa at 20&amp;nbsp;°C is&lt;ref&gt;DIN51 757 (04.1994): Testing of mineral oils and related materials; determination of density&lt;/ref&gt; 0.001205 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and that of water is 0.998203 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; we see that the difference between true and apparent relative densities for a substance with relative density (20&amp;nbsp;°C/20&amp;nbsp;°C) of about 1.100 would be 0.000120. Where the relative density of the sample is close to that of water (for example dilute ethanol solutions) the correction is even smaller.

The pycnometer is used in ISO standard: ISO 1183-1:2004, ISO 1014–1985 and [[ASTM International|ASTM]] standard: ASTM D854.

===Digital density meters===
''Hydrostatic Pressure-based Instruments'': This technology relies upon Pascal's Principle which states that the pressure difference between two points within a vertical column of fluid is dependent upon the vertical distance between the two points, the density of the fluid and the gravitational force. This technology is often used for tank gaging applications as a convenient means of liquid level and density measure.

''Vibrating Element Transducers'': This type of instrument requires a vibrating element to be placed in contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of relative density are made using [[oscillating U-tube]] meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80&amp;nbsp;°C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or true relative density and contain tables relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc. The vibrating fork immersion probe is another good example of this technology. This technology also includes many coriolis-type mass flow meters which are widely used in chemical and petroleum industry for high accuracy mass flow measurement and can be configured to also output density information based on the resonant frequency of the vibrating flow tubes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yokogawa.com/an/download/.../Bulletin12T03A01-01E_010.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ultrasonic Transducer'': Ultrasonic waves are passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a detector which measures the acoustic spectroscopy of the waves. Fluid properties such as density and viscosity can be inferred from the spectrum.

''Radiation-based Gauge'': Radiation is passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a scintillation detector, or counter. As the fluid density increases, the detected radiation &quot;counts&quot; will decrease. The source is typically the radioactive isotope [[cesium-137]], with a half-life of about 30 years. A key advantage for this technology is that the instrument is not required to be in contact with the fluid—typically the source and detector are mounted on the outside of tanks or piping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohmartvega.com/en/nuclear_density_DSG.htm Density – VEGA Americas, Inc]. Ohmartvega.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Buoyant Force Transducer'': the buoyancy force produced by a float in a homogeneous liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid that is displaced by the float. Since buoyancy force is linear with respect to the density of the liquid within which the float is submerged, the measure of the buoyancy force yields a measure of the density of the liquid. One commercially available unit claims the instrument is capable of measuring relative density with an accuracy of ± 0.005 RD units. The submersible probe head contains a mathematically characterized spring-float system. When the head is immersed vertically in the liquid, the float moves vertically and the position of the float controls the position of a permanent magnet whose displacement is sensed by a concentric array of Hall-effect linear displacement sensors. The output signals of the sensors are mixed in a dedicated electronics module that provides a single output voltage whose magnitude is a direct linear measure of the quantity to be measured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardco.com/pages/density/electric_hydrometer.cfm Process Control Digital Electronic Hydrometer].

==Examples==
Substances with a relative density of 1 are neutrally buoyant, those with RD greater than one are denser than water, and so (ignoring [[surface tension]] effects) will sink in it, and those with an RD of less than one are less dense than water, and so will float.

Example:

:&lt;math&gt;
RD_{H_2O} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{Material}}{\rho_\mathrm{H_2O}}\ = RD,
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''luminosity function''' or '''luminous efficiency function''' describes the average [[spectral sensitivity]] of human visual perception of brightness.  It is based on subjective judgements of which of a pair of different-colored lights is brighter, to describe relative sensitivity to light of different wavelengths. It should not be considered perfectly accurate in every case, but it is a very good representation of visual sensitivity of the human eye and it is valuable as a baseline for experimental purposes. 

The CIE luminosity function &lt;math&gt;\overline{y}(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;V(\lambda)\,&lt;/math&gt; is a standard function established by the [[Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage]] (CIE) and may be used to convert radiant energy into luminous (i.e., visible) energy. It also forms the central [[CIE 1931 color space#Color matching functions|color matching function]] in the [[CIE 1931 color space]].

== Details ==

There are two luminosity functions in common use. For everyday light levels, the [[photopic vision|photopic]] luminosity function best approximates the response of the human eye. For low light levels, the response of the human eye changes, and the [[scotopic vision|scotopic]] curve applies. The photopic curve is the CIE standard curve used in the CIE 1931 color space.

The [[luminous flux]] (or visible energy) in a light source is defined by the photopic luminosity function. The following equation calculates the total luminous flux in a source of light. 

:&lt;math&gt;F=683.002\ \mathrm{lm/W}\cdot \int^\infin_0 \overline{y}(\lambda) J(\lambda) d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is the luminous flux in [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s,
:&lt;math&gt;J(\lambda)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[spectral power distribution]] of the radiation (power per unit wavelength), in watts per meter.
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{y}(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; (also known as &lt;math&gt;V(\lambda)\,&lt;/math&gt;) is the standard luminosity function (which is dimensionless).
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; is wavelength in meters.

Formally, the integral is the [[inner product]] of the luminosity function with the light spectrum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles2003&quot;/&gt; In practice, the integral is replaced by a sum over discrete wavelengths for which tabulated values of the luminosity function are available. The [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] distributes standard tables with luminosity function values at 5&amp;nbsp;nm intervals from 380&amp;nbsp;nm to 780&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIEdocs&quot; group=cie/&gt; 

The standard luminosity function is normalized to a peak value of unity at 555&amp;nbsp;nm (see [[luminous coefficient]]). The value of the constant in front of the integral is usually rounded off to 683&amp;nbsp;lm/W. The small excess fractional value comes from the slight mismatch between the definition of the lumen and the peak of the luminosity function. The lumen is defined to be unity for a radiant energy of 1/683 watt at a frequency of 540 THz, which corresponds to a standard air wavelength of 555.016&amp;nbsp;nm rather than 555&amp;nbsp;nm, which is the peak of the luminosity curve. The value of &lt;math&gt;\overline{y}(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is 0.999997 at 555.016&amp;nbsp;nm, so that a value of 683/0.999997 = 683.002 is the multiplicative constant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyszecki2000&quot;/&gt;
The number 683 is connected to the modern (1979) definition of the [[candela]], the unit of [[luminous intensity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;candela&quot; group=cie/&gt; This arbitrary number made the new definition give numbers equivalent to those from the old definition of the candela.

== Improvements to the standard ==

The CIE 1924 photopic &lt;math&gt;V(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; luminosity function,&lt;ref name=&quot;CIE1926&quot; group=cie/&gt; which is included in the CIE 1931 color-matching functions as the ''y'' function, has long been acknowledged to underestimate the contribution of the blue end of the spectrum to perceived luminance.  There have been numerous attempts to improve the standard function, to make it more representative of human vision.  Judd in 1951,&lt;ref name=&quot;Judd1975&quot;/&gt; improved by Vos in 1978,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vos1978&quot;/&gt; resulted in a function known as CIE &lt;math&gt;V_M(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stiles1955&quot;/&gt;  More recently, Sharpe, Stockman, Jagla &amp; Jägle (2005) developed a function consistent with the [http://www.cvrl.org/cones.htm Stockman &amp; Sharpe cone fundamentals];&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharpe2005&quot;/&gt; their curves are plotted in the figure above.

== Scotopic luminosity ==

For very low levels of intensity ([[scotopic vision]]), the sensitivity of the eye is mediated by rods, not cones, and shifts toward the [[violet (color)|violet]], peaking around 507&amp;nbsp;nm for young eyes; the sensitivity is equivalent to 1699&amp;nbsp;lm/W&lt;ref name=&quot;Kohei2004&quot;/&gt; or 1700&amp;nbsp;lm/W&lt;ref name=&quot;Casimer1998&quot;/&gt; at this peak.  

The standard scotopic luminosity function or &lt;math&gt;V^\prime(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; was adopted by the CIE in 1951, based on measurements by Wald (1945) and by Crawford (1949).[http://www.cvrl.org/database/text/lum/scvl.htm]

== Color blindness ==
[[File:LuminosityCurve2.svg|right|thumb|400px|Protanopic (green) and deuteranopic (red) luminosity functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;judd&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Judd|first=Deane B.|title=Contributions to Color Science|year=1979|publisher=NBS|location=Washington D.C. 20234|url=http://books.google.ru/books?id=jgz_iI8NAzYC&amp;pg=PA316|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the standard photopic curve is shown in yellow.]]
[[Color blindness]] changes the sensitivity of the eye as a function of wavelength. For people with [[protanopia]], the peak of the eye's response is shifted toward the short-wave part of the spectrum (approximately 540&amp;nbsp;nm), while for people suffering [[deuteranopia]], there is a slight shift in the peak of the spectrum, to about 560&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=&quot;judd&quot; /&gt; People with protanopia have essentially no sensitivity to light of wavelengths more than 670&amp;nbsp;nm.

Most [[mammals]] other than [[primates]] have the same luminosity function as people with protanopia. This makes it possible to study the nocturnal life of animals by illuminating the scene with long-wavelength red light that they can't see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=I. S. McLennan &amp; J. Taylor-Jeffs|title=The use of sodium lamps to brightly illuminate mouse houses during their dark phases|journal=Laboratory Animals|year=2004|volume=38|pages=384–392|pmid=15479553|doi= 10.1258/0023677041958927|url=http://la.rsmjournals.com/content/38/4/384.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For older people with normal color vision, the [[crystalline lens]] may become slightly yellow due to [[cataract]]s, which moves the maximum of sensitivity to the red part of the spectrum and narrows the range of perceived wavelengths.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25214">'''Luminous efficacy''' is a measure of how well a light source produces visible light. It is the ratio of [[luminous flux]] to [[power (physics)|power]]. Depending on context, the power can be either the [[radiant flux]] of the source's output, or it can be the total power (electric power, chemical energy, or others) consumed by the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Allen Stimson |title=Photometry and Radiometry for Engineers |publisher=Wiley and Son |location=New York |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Optical Radiation Measurements, Vol 1 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |author=Franc Grum, Richard Becherer |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Radiometry and the Detection of Optical Radiation |publisher=Wiley and Son |location=New York |author=Robert Boyd |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Which sense of the term is intended must usually be inferred from the context, and is sometimes unclear.  The former sense is sometimes called '''luminous efficacy of radiation''', and the latter '''luminous efficacy of a source'''.

The luminous efficacy of a source is a measure of the efficiency with which the source provides visible light from  electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=Photovoltaic systems engineering |edition=2 |author=Roger A. Messenger; Jerry Ventre |publisher=CRC Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8493-1793-4 |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The luminous efficacy of radiation describes how well a given quantity of electromagnetic radiation from a source produces visible light: the ratio of [[luminous flux]] to [[radiant flux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Color imaging: fundamentals and applications |author=Erik Reinhard, Erum Arif Khan, Ahmet Oğuz Akyüz, Garrett Johnson |publisher=A K Peters, Ltd |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-56881-344-8 |page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Not all wavelengths of light are equally visible, or equally effective at stimulating human vision, due to the [[spectral sensitivity]] of the [[human eye]]; radiation in the [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] parts of the spectrum is useless for illumination. The overall luminous efficacy of a source is the product of how well it converts energy to electromagnetic radiation, and how well the emitted radiation is detected by the human eye.

==Efficacy and efficiency==&lt;!--Luminous coefficient redirects here--&gt;

In some [[Units of measurement|systems of units]], luminous flux has the same units as radiant flux. The luminous efficacy of radiation is then [[dimensionless]]. In this case, it is often instead called the '''luminous efficiency''', and may be expressed as a percentage. A common choice is to choose units such that the maximum possible efficacy, 683&amp;nbsp;lm/W, corresponds to an efficiency of 100%. The distinction between ''efficacy'' and ''efficiency'' is not always carefully maintained in published sources, so it is not uncommon to see &quot;efficiencies&quot; expressed in lumens per watt, or &quot;efficacies&quot; expressed as a percentage.

The '''luminous coefficient''' is luminous efficiency expressed as a value between zero and one, with one corresponding to an efficacy of 683&amp;nbsp;lm/W.

==Luminous efficacy of radiation==

===Explanation===

[[File:CIE 1931 Luminosity.png|right|thumb|The [[Luminosity function|response of a typical human eye to light]], as standardized by the [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] in 1924. The horizontal axis is wavelength in nm]]

[[Wavelength]]s of light outside of the [[visible spectrum]] are not useful for illumination because they cannot be seen by the [[human eye]]. Furthermore, the eye responds more to some wavelengths of light than others, even within the visible spectrum. This response of the eye is represented by the [[luminosity function]]. This is a standardized function which represents the response of a &quot;typical&quot; eye under bright conditions ([[photopic vision]]). One can also define a similar curve for dim conditions ([[scotopic vision]]). When neither is specified, photopic conditions are generally assumed.

Luminous efficacy of radiation measures the fraction of electromagnetic power which is useful for lighting. It is obtained by dividing the [[luminous flux]] by the [[radiant flux]]. Light with wavelengths outside the [[visible spectrum]] reduces luminous efficacy, because it contributes to the radiant flux while the luminous flux of such light is zero. Wavelengths near the peak of the eye's response contribute more strongly than those near the edges.

In [[SI]], luminous efficacy has units of [[Lumen (unit)|lumen]]s per [[watt]] (lm/W). Photopic luminous efficacy of radiation has a maximum possible value of 683&amp;nbsp;lm/W, for the case of monochromatic light at a wavelength of 555&amp;nbsp;nm (green). Scotopic luminous efficacy of radiation reaches a maximum of 1700&amp;nbsp;lm/W for narrowband light of wavelength 507&amp;nbsp;nm.

===Mathematical definition===

The dimensionless luminous efficiency measures the [[integral|integrated]] fraction of the [[radiant power]] that contributes to its luminous properties as evaluated by means of the standard [[luminosity function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition| publisher=D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc.| location=Princeton, New Jersey, Toronto, London, New York|date=January 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The luminous coefficient is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \int^\infty_0 y_\lambda J_\lambda d\lambda } { \int^\infty_0 J_\lambda d\lambda },&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:''y''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard [[luminosity function]],
:''J''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[spectral power distribution]] of the radiant intensity.

The luminous coefficient is [[Dirac delta function|unity for a narrow band]] of wavelengths at 555 [[nanometre]]s.

Note that &lt;math&gt;\int^\infty_0 y_\lambda J_\lambda d\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an [[inner product]] between &lt;math&gt;y_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;\int^\infty_0 J_\lambda d\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[norm (mathematics)|one-norm]] of &lt;math&gt;J_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

==Lighting efficiency== &lt;!--Many terms redirect to this section--&gt;

Artificial light sources are usually evaluated in terms of luminous efficacy of a source, also sometimes called  ''overall luminous efficacy''. This is the ratio between the total luminous flux emitted by a device and the total amount of input power (electrical, etc.) it consumes. It is also sometimes referred to as the '''wall-plug luminous efficacy''' or simply '''wall-plug efficacy'''. The overall luminous efficacy is a measure of the efficiency of the device with the output adjusted to account for the spectral response curve (the “luminosity function”). When expressed in dimensionless form (for example, as a fraction of the maximum possible luminous efficacy), this value may be called '''overall luminous efficiency''', '''wall-plug luminous efficiency''', or simply the '''lighting efficiency'''.

The main difference between the luminous efficacy of radiation and the luminous efficacy of a source is that the latter accounts for input energy that is lost as [[heat]] or otherwise exits the source as something other than electromagnetic radiation.  Luminous efficacy of radiation is a property of the radiation emitted by a source. Luminous efficacy of a source is a property of the source as a whole.

===Examples===
The following table lists luminous efficacy of a source and efficiency for various light sources. Note that all lamps requiring [[Electrical ballast|electrical/electronic ballast]] are unless noted (see also voltage) listed without [[Electrical efficiency|losses]] for that, reducing total efficiency.

Sources that depend on thermal emission from a solid filament, such as [[incandescent light bulb]]s, tend to have low overall efficacy because, as explained by Donald L. Klipstein, “An ideal thermal radiator produces visible light most efficiently at temperatures around 6300&amp;nbsp;°C (6600&amp;nbsp;K or 11,500&amp;nbsp;°F). Even at this high temperature, a lot of the radiation is either infrared or ultraviolet, and the theoretical luminous [efficacy] is 95 lumens per watt. No substance is solid and usable as a light bulb filament at temperatures anywhere close to this. The surface of the sun is not quite that hot.”&lt;ref name=&quot;bulbguide&quot;/&gt; At temperatures where the [[tungsten]] filament of an ordinary light bulb remains solid (below 3683 kelvins), most of its emission is in the [[infrared]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bulbguide&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2900">In a crystalline material, a [[dislocation]] is capable of traveling throughout the lattice when relatively small stresses are applied. This movement of dislocations results in the material [[Deformation (engineering)|plastically deforming]]. '''Pinning points''' in the material act to halt a dislocation's movement, requiring a greater amount of force to be applied to overcome the barrier. This results in an overall [[Strengthening mechanisms of materials|strengthening of materials]].

==Types of pinning points==
===Point defects===
[[Crystallographic defect#Point defects|Point defects]] (as well as stationary dislocations, jogs, and kinks) present in a material create [[stress field]]s within a material that disallow traveling dislocations to come into direct contact. Much like two particles of the same electric charge feel a repulsion to one another when brought together, the dislocation is pushed away from the already present stress field.

===Alloying elements=== 
The introduction of atom&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into a crystal of atom&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; creates a pinning point for multiple reasons. An [[alloy]]ing atom is by nature a point defect, thus it must create a stress field when placed into a foreign crystallographic position, which could block the passage of a dislocation. However, it is possible that the alloying material is approximately the same size as the atom that is replaced, and thus its presence would not stress the lattice (as occurs in cobalt alloyed nickel). The different atom would, though, have a different [[elastic modulus]], which would create a different terrain for the moving dislocation. A higher modulus would look like an energy barrier, and a lower like an energy trough – both of which would stop its movement.

===Second phase precipitates===
{{main|Precipitation hardening}}
The [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of a second phase within the lattice of a material creates physical blockades through which a dislocation cannot pass. The result is that the dislocation must bend (which requires greater energy, or a greater stress to be applied) around the precipitates, which inevitably leaves residual dislocation loops encircling the second phase material and shortens the original dislocation.

[[Image:Solute copy.jpg|thumb|900px|center|boarder|This schematic shows how a dislocation interacts with solid phase precipitates. The dislocation moves from left to right in each frame.]]

===Grain boundaries=== 
Dislocations require proper lattice ordering to move through a material. At [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]], there is a lattice mismatch, and every atom that lies on the boundary is [[Coordination number|uncoordinated]]. This stops dislocations that encounter the boundary from moving.

Ionized material carried along the field lines will at some point &lt;math&gt; r_c &lt;/math&gt; escape the magnetic field lines and thus take away the Sun's angular momentum]]
'''Magnetic braking''' is a theory explaining the loss of stellar [[angular momentum]] due to material getting captured by the [[stellar magnetic field]] and thrown out at great distance from the surface of the star. It plays an important role in the evolution of [[binary star]] systems.

==The problem==
The currently accepted theory of the [[solar systems|solar system's]] evolution states that the Solar System originates from a contracting gas cloud. As the cloud contracts, the [[angular momentum]] &lt;math&gt; L&lt;/math&gt; must be [[angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conserved]]. Any small net rotation of the cloud will cause the spin to increase as the cloud collapses, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a [[protostar]] forms, which gains heat from the [[gravitational energy]] of the collapse. As the collapse continues, the rotation rate can increase to the point where the accreting protostar can break up due to [[centrifugal force]] at the equator.

Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000 years of the star's life to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind. In the case of our own Sun, when the planets' angular momenta are compared to the Sun's own, the Sun has less than 1% of its supposed angular momentum. In other words, the Sun has slowed down its spin while the planets have not.

==The idea behind magnetic braking==
Ionized material captured by the magnetic field lines will rotate with the Sun as if it were a solid body. As material escapes from the Sun due to the [[solar wind]], the highly ionized material will be captured by the field lines and rotate with the same angular velocity as the Sun, even though it is carried far away from the Sun's surface, until it eventually escapes. This effect of carrying mass far from the centre of the Sun and throwing it away slows down the spin of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ferreira, J.; Pelletier, G.; Appl, S. |title=Reconnection X-winds: spin-down of low-mass protostars |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |year=2000 |volume=312 |issue=2 |pages=387–397 |bibcode=2000MNRAS.312..387F |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03215.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Devitt |title=What Puts The Brakes On Madly Spinning Stars? |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison |date=January 31, 2001 |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/5732 |accessdate=2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same effect is used in slowing the spin of a [[Yo-yo de-spin|rotating satellite]]; here two wires spool out weights to a distance slowing the satellites spin, then the wires are cut, letting the weights escape into space and permanently robbing the spacecraft of its [[angular momentum]].

==Theory behind magnetic braking==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
{{original research section|date=April 2013}}
As ionized material follows the Sun's magnetic field lines, due to the effect of the field lines being frozen in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], the charged particles feel a force &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} &lt;/math&gt; of the magnitude:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}=q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the charge, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic field vector.  This bending action forces the particles to &quot;[[corkscrew]]&quot; around the magnetic field lines while held in place by a &quot;magnetic pressure&quot;&lt;math&gt; P_B &lt;/math&gt;, or &quot;energy density&quot;, while rotating together with the Sun as a solid body:

:&lt;math&gt;P_B=\frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0} &lt;/math&gt;

Since magnetic field strength decreases with the cube of the distance there will be a place where the kinetic gas pressure &lt;math&gt; P_g &lt;/math&gt; of the ionized gas is great enough to break away from the field lines:

:&lt;math&gt; P_g=n m v^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where n is the number of particles, m is the mass of the individual particle and v is the radial velocity away from the Sun, or the speed of the solar wind.

The magnetic field strength as a function of radius can be approximated as:
:&lt;math&gt; B(r)=\frac{D_\odot}{r^3}  &lt;/math&gt;

The critical distance where the material will break away from the field lines can then be calculated as the distance where the kinetic pressure and the magnetic pressure are equal, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt; P_B=P_g \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{B(rc)^2}{2\mu_0}=n m v^2\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D_{\odot}^2}{2\mu_0 r_c^6}=n m v^2&lt;/math&gt;

If the solar mass loss is omni-directional then the mass loss &lt;math&gt;n m= \frac{dM/dt}{4\pi r^2 v}&lt;/math&gt;; plugging this into the above equation and isolating the critical radius it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;r_c=\left(\frac{2\pi D_\odot ^2}{\mu_0 v \dot{M}}\right)^{1 \over 4}&lt;/math&gt;

===Present day value===
Currently it is estimated that:
* The mass loss of the Sun is about &lt;math&gt;\dot{M}=dM/dt=2 \cdot 10^9 kg/s&lt;/math&gt;
* The solar wind speed is  &lt;math&gt;v=5\cdot10^5m/s&lt;/math&gt;
* The dipole field is &lt;math&gt;D_{\odot}=8 \cdot 10^{22} T m^3&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to a critical radius &lt;math&gt;r_c =3.4 R_\odot&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the ionized plasma will rotate together with the Sun as a solid body until it reaches a distance of nearly 3.4 the radius of the Sun; from there the material will break off and stop affecting the Sun.

The amount of solar mass needed to be thrown out along the field lines to make the Sun completely stop rotating can then be calculated using the specific angular momentum:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{j_\odot}{j_c}=\left(\frac{R_\odot}{r_c}\right)^2 \approx 10\%&lt;/math&gt;
About 1/10 of the solar mass should thus have be lost by now due to this effect, but if the  present mass loss rate was stable throughout the Sun's &quot;life&quot; only about 0.01% of the Sun's original mass would have been lost. This indicates that either the Sun's mass loss must have been higher in the past or that the Sun's magnetic field has been much stronger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6137">The '''distance modulus''' is a way of expressing distances that is often used in [[astronomy]].

==Definition==

The distance modulus &lt;math&gt;\mu=m-M&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between the [[apparent magnitude]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; (ideally, corrected from the effects of [[interstellar reddening|interstellar absorption]]) and the [[absolute magnitude]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of an [[astronomical object]]. It is related to the distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; in parsecs by:

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}(d) = 1 + \frac{\mu}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mu=5\log_{10}(d)-5&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is convenient because the observed brightness of a light source is related to its distance by the [[inverse square law]] (a source twice as far away appears one quarter as bright) and because brightnesses are usually expressed not directly, but in [[apparent magnitude|magnitudes]]. 

Absolute magnitude &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the apparent magnitude of an object when seen at a distance of 10 [[parsec]]s. Suppose a light source has luminosity L(d) when observed from a distance of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; parsecs, and luminosity L(10) when observed from a distance of 10 parsecs. The inverse-square law is then written like:

:&lt;math&gt;L(d) = \frac{L(10)}{(\frac{d}{10})^2} &lt;/math&gt;

The magnitudes and luminosities are related by:

:&lt;math&gt;m = -2.5 \log_{10}L(d) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M = -2.5 \log_{10}L(10) &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting and rearranging, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;m - M = 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = \mu &lt;/math&gt;

which means that the apparent magnitude is the absolute magnitude plus the distance modulus.

Isolating &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; from the equation &lt;math&gt;5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = \mu &lt;/math&gt;, we find that the distance (or, the [[luminosity distance]]) in parsecs is given by

:&lt;math&gt;d = 10^{\frac{\mu}{5}+1} &lt;/math&gt;

The uncertainty in the distance in parsecs (δd) can be computed from the uncertainty in the distance modulus (δμ) using

:&lt;math&gt; \delta d = 0.2 \ln(10) 10^{0.2\mu+1} \delta\mu = 0.461 d \ \delta\mu&lt;/math&gt;

which is derived using standard error analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor1982&quot;&gt;{{cite book

== Different kinds of distance moduli ==
Distance is not the only quantity relevant in determining the difference between absolute and apparent magnitude. Absorption is another important factor and it may even be a dominant one in particular cases (e. g. in the direction of the galactic center).

Thus a distinction is made between distance moduli uncorrected for [[interstellar reddening|interstellar absorption]] (whose values would overestimate the distance if used naively) and absorption-corrected moduli.

The first ones are termed ''visual distance moduli'' and are denoted by &lt;math&gt;{(m - M)}_{v}&lt;/math&gt; while the second ones are called ''true distance moduli'' and denoted by &lt;math&gt;{(m - M)}_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

Visual distance moduli are computed by calculating the difference between the observed apparent magnitude and some theoretical estimate of the absolute magnitude. True distance moduli require a further theoretical step, that is the estimation of the [[interstellar absorption coefficient]].

==Usage==

Distance moduli are most commonly used when expressing the distance to other galaxies in the relatively nearby universe.  For example, the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] is at a distance modulus of 18.5,&lt;ref name=&quot;alvez2--4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Using distance moduli makes computing magnitudes easy. As for instance, a solar type star (M=5) in Andromeda galaxy (DM=24.4) would have an apparent magnitude (m) of 5 + 24.4 = 29.4, so it would be barely visible in the [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]], which has a limiting magnitude of about 30 [http://www.astro.uu.nl/~strous/AA/en/antwoorden/magnituden.html]. This calculation can be done quickly in one's head.  Since it is apparent magnitudes which are actually measured at a telescope, this way of looking at things serves to highlight the fact that many discussions about distances in astronomy are really discussions about the putative or derived absolute magnitudes of the distant objects being observed.

A second international standard on quantities and units was [[IEC 60027]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. The ISO 31 and IEC 60027 Standards were revised by the two standardization organizations in collaboration ([http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter1/1-2.html], [http://www.iec.ch/zone/si/si_present.htm]) to integrate both standards into a joint standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|''ISO/IEC 80000 - Quantities and Units'']] in which the quantities and equations used with SI are to be referred as the ''International System of Quantities'' (ISQ). ISO/IEC 80000 supersedes both ISO 31 and part of IEC 60027.

==Coined words==
[[ISO 31-0]] introduced several new words into the [[English language]] that are direct spelling-[[calques]] from the [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/Document/sp811.pdf NIST SP811](§8.9)&lt;/ref&gt; The intention was that these words be used in scientific papers for the sake of convenience and clarity.

In [[physics]], '''angular frequency''' ω (also referred to by the terms '''angular speed''', '''radial frequency''', '''circular frequency''', '''orbital frequency''', '''radian frequency''', and '''pulsatance''') is a scalar measure of rotation rate. It refers to the [[angular displacement]] per unit time (e.g., in rotation) or the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform (e.g., in oscillations and waves), or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function.

Angular frequency (or angular speed) is the magnitude of the vector quantity ''[[angular velocity]]''. The term '''angular frequency vector''' &lt;math&gt;\vec{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used as a synonym for the vector quantity angular velocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;UP1&quot;&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = {{2 \pi} \over T} = {2 \pi f} , &lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''ω'' is the angular frequency or angular speed (measured in [[radians per second]]),
:''T'' is the [[Frequency|period]] (measured in [[second]]s),
:''f'' is the [[ordinary frequency]] (measured in [[hertz]]) (sometimes symbolised with [[nu (letter)|ν]]).

==Units==
In [[SI]] [[Units of measurement|units]], angular frequency is normally presented in [[radian]]s per [[second]], even when it does not express a rotational value. From the perspective of [[dimensional analysis]], the unit [[hertz]] (Hz) is also correct, but in practice it is only used for ordinary frequency ''f'', and almost never for ω. This convention helps avoid confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eJhkD0LKtJEC&amp;pg=PA145| title= Physics for scientists and engineers| first=Lawrence S.|last= Lerner|page=145| isbn=978-0-86720-479-7| date=1996-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[digital signal processing]], the angular frequency may be normalized by the [[sampling rate]], yielding the [[normalized frequency (digital signal processing)|normalized frequency]].

==Examples==
[[File:Rotating Sphere.gif|right|thumb|A sphere rotating around an axis. Points farther from the axis move faster, satisfying {{nowrap|''ω''{{=}}''v''/''r''}}.]]

===Circular motion===
{{main|Circular motion}}
In a rotating or orbiting object, there is a relation between distance from the axis, [[tangential speed]], and the angular frequency of the rotation:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = v/r&lt;/math&gt;

===Oscillations of a spring===
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}
An object attached to a spring will [[Oscillation|oscillate]]. Assuming that the spring is ideal and massless with no damping then the motion will be [[Harmonic oscillator|simple and harmonic]] with an angular frequency given by:&lt;ref name=PoP1&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt; \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} , &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''k'' is the [[spring constant]]
:''m'' is the mass of the object.

ω is referred to as the natural frequency (which can sometimes be denoted as ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

As the object oscillates, its acceleration can be calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;a = - \omega^2  x \; , &lt;/math&gt;
where x is displacement from an equilibrium position.

Using 'ordinary' revolutions-per-second frequency, this equation would be
:&lt;math&gt; a = - 4  \pi^2  f^2  x\; . &lt;/math&gt;

===LC circuits===

The resonant angular frequency in an [[LC circuit]] equals the square root of the inverse of [[capacitance]] (C measured in [[farad]]s), times the [[inductance]] of the circuit (L in [[Henry (unit)|henrys]]).&lt;ref name=LC1&gt;{{cite book

In a physical setting a [[measuring instrument|measurement instrument]] may be gauged to measuring substances of a specific [[physical quantity]]. In such a context the specific physical quantity is called a '''measured quantity'''.

The synonymous notion &quot;[[observable]]&quot; often is used in the context of [[quantum mechanics]].

[[Scientific model]]s and ensuing [[mathematical model]]s of a physical setting permit to calculate expected values of related non-measured physical quantities.

'''ISO 80000''' or '''IEC 80000''' is an [[international standard]] promulgated jointly by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]  (IEC).

The standard introduces the [[International System of Quantities]] (ISQ). It is a style guide for the use of [[physical quantities]] and units of [[measurement]], formulas involving them, and their corresponding units, in scientific and educational documents for worldwide use. In most countries, the notations used in mathematics and science textbooks at schools and universities follow closely the guidelines in this standard.

The ISO/IEC 80000 family of standards was completed with the publication of Part 1 in November 2009. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=46202 Standards Catalogue TC/12 Quantities and Units]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International System of Quantities==
{{main|International System of Quantities}}
Part 1 of ISO/IEC 80000 introduces the International System of Quantities and describes its relationship with the [[International System of Units]] (SI).  Specifically, its introduction states &quot;The system of quantities, including the relations among the quantities used as the basis of the units of the SI, is named the ''International System of Quantities'', denoted 'ISQ', in all languages.&quot;, and further clarifies that &quot;ISQ is simply a convenient notation to assign to the essentially infinite and continually evolving and expanding system of quantities and equations on which all of modern science and technology rests&quot;.

==Units of ISO/IEC 80000==
The standard includes all SI units but is not limited to only SI units.  Units that form part of the standard but not the SI include the units of information storage ([[bit]] and [[byte]]), units of entropy ([[shannon (unit)|shannon]], [[nat (unit)|natural unit of information]] and [[hartley (unit)|hartley]]), the [[Erlang (unit)|erlang]] (a unit of traffic intensity) and units of level ([[neper]] and [[decibel]]).  The standard includes all [[SI prefix]]es as well as the [[binary prefix]]es kibi-, mebi-, gibi-, etc., originally introduced by the [[IEC 60027-2|International Electrotechnical Commission]] to standardise binary multiples of byte such as [[mebibyte]] (MiB), for {{val|1024}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bytes, to distinguish them from their decimal counterparts such as megabyte (MB), for precisely one million ({{val|1000}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) bytes.  In the standard, the application of the binary prefixes is not limited to units of information storage.  For example, a frequency ten octaves above one hertz, i.e., 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Hz ({{val|1024|u=Hz}}), is one kibihertz (1 KiHz).

==Binary prefixes==
{{main|Binary prefix}}
A 1999 addendum to [[IEC 60027|IEC 60027-2]] on binary prefixes has resulted in public interest in the standard and is still being widely discussed in the computer community, as it provides a clear framework of prefixes that resolve the discrepancy and resulting confusion of using, e.g., a [[kilobit]] to indicate 1000 bits (1 [[kilobit|kbit]]) or 1024 bits (1 [[kibibit|Kibit]]).

The harmonized IEC 80000-13:2008 standard cancels and replaces subclauses 3.8 and 3.9 of IEC 60027-2:2005, those defining prefixes for binary multiples. The only significant change is the addition of explicit definitions for some quantities.

The '''extracellular field potential''' is the [[electrical potential]] produced by [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, e.g. [[Neuron|nerve]] or [[Muscle fiber|muscle cell]]s, outside of the cell.  [[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological studies]] investigate these potentials using extracellular [[microelectrode]]s. In these experiments the extracellular field potential will be detected as an electrical potential whose source and composition is often ambiguous, making its interpretation difficult. Individual nerve cells [[neuron]]s may produce [[Voltage spike|spike]]s seen as peaks of some tens to hundreds of microvolts. Contributions from neighboring neurons may overlap, producing extracellular potentials of up to several millivolts. Spatially integrating over even larger populations of cells, i.e. lumps of [[nervous tissue|nervous]] or [[muscle|muscular tissue]], will produce signals commonly called [[local field potential]]s (LFP) that can be recorded either in the tissue or with suitable equipment at the body surface as, e.g., [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG), or [[electromyogram]] (EMG).

For individual cells, the time course of the extracellular potential theoretically is inversely proportional to the transmembrane current. In practice, however, this is complicated considerably by the very complex [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of neurons and the overlap of contributions from adjacent cells.

The '''single-particle spectrum''' is a distribution of a physical quantity such as energy or [[momentum]]. The study of particle spectra allows us to see the global picture of particle production.

Its roots can be traced to [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier's]] concept of [[dimensional analysis]] (1822).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Fourier | first = Joseph | authorlink = Joseph Fourier | title = Théorie analytique de la chaleur | year = 1822}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic [[axiom]] of quantity calculus is [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] description&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Maxwell | first = J.

De Boer summarized the multiplication, division, addition, association and commutation rules of quantity calculus and proposed that a full [[axiomatization]] has yet to be completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;deBoer&quot; /&gt; 

Measurements are expressed as products of a numeric value with a unit symbol, e.g. &quot;12.7&amp;nbsp;m&quot;.  Unlike algebra, the unit symbol represents a measurable quantity such as a meter, not an [[Variable (mathematics)|algebraic variable]].

A careful distinction needs to be made between [[abstract quantity|abstract quantities]] and [[measured quantity|measurable quantities]]. The multiplication and division rules of quantity calculus are applied to [[SI base unit]]s (which are [[measured quantity|measurable quantities]]) to define [[SI derived unit]]s, including [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] derived units, such as the [[radian]] (rad) and [[steradian]] (sr) which are useful for clarity, although they are both algebraically equal to 1. Thus there is some disagreement about whether it is meaningful to multiply or divide units. Emerson suggests that if the units of a quantity are algebraically simplified, they then are no longer units of that quantity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson&quot;&gt;{{citation | title = On quantity calculus and units of measurement |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/45/2/002| first = W.H. | last = Emerson | year = 2008 |journal = [[Metrologia]] | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–138 | doi=10.1088/0026-1394/45/2/002|bibcode = 2008Metro..45..134E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johansson proposes that there are logical flaws in the application of quantity calculus, and that the so-called dimensionless quantities should be understood as &quot;unitless quantities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johansson&quot;&gt;{{citation | title = Metrological thinking needs the notions of ''parametric'' quantities, units and dimensions | url = http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/47/3/012/ | first = I. | last = Johansson | year = 2010 |journal = [[Metrologia]] | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–230|bibcode = 2010Metro..47..219J |doi = 10.1088/0026-1394/47/3/012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}
In [[physics]], a '''force''' is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the [[motion (physics)|motion]] of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nave|first1=C. R.|title=Force|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/force.html|website=Hyperphysics|publisher=Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State University|accessdate=15 August 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a force can cause an object with [[mass]] to change its [[velocity]] (which includes to begin moving from a [[Newton's first law|state of rest]]), i.e., to [[accelerate]]. Force can also be described by intuitive concepts such as a push or a pull. A force has both [[Euclidean vector#Length|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]], making it a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] quantity.  It is measured in the [[SI unit]] of [[newton (unit)|newtons]] and represented by the symbol '''F'''.

The original form of [[Newton's second law]] states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the [[time derivative|rate]] at which its [[momentum]] changes with time. If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the [[acceleration]] of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the [[mass]] of the object

Related concepts to force include: [[thrust]], which increases the velocity of an object; [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which decreases the velocity of an object; and [[torque]], which produces [[angular acceleration|changes in rotational speed]] of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the so-called [[stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]]. [[Pressure]] is a simple type of stress. Stress usually causes [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of solid materials, or flow in [[fluid]]s.

==Development of the concept==
Philosophers in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] used the concept of force in the study of [[statics|stationary]] and [[dynamics (physics)|moving]] objects and [[simple machine]]s, but thinkers such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]] retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of [[friction]], and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archimedes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Heath, T.L. |url=http://www.archive.org/details/worksofarchimede029517mbp |title=''The Works of Archimedes'' (1897). The unabridged work in PDF form (19&amp;nbsp;MB) |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by [[Sir Isaac Newton]]; with his mathematical insight, he formulated [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt; By the early 20th century, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] developed a [[theory of relativity]] that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and [[inertia]].

With modern insights into [[quantum mechanics]] and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light, [[particle physics]] has devised a [[Standard Model]] to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The [[Standard Model]] predicts that exchanged particles called [[gauge boson]]s are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. Only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: [[strong force|strong]], [[electromagnetic force|electromagnetic]], [[weak force|weak]], and [[gravitational force|gravitational]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–10}}&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;{{rp|79}} [[High energy physics|High-energy particle physics]] [[observation]]s made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental [[electroweak]] interaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;final theory&quot;/&gt;

==Pre-Newtonian concepts==
{{see also|Aristotelian physics|Theory of impetus}}
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristotle]] famously described a force as anything that causes an object to undergo &quot;unnatural motion&quot;]]
Since antiquity the concept of force has been recognized as integral to the functioning of each of the [[simple machine]]s. The [[mechanical advantage]] given by a simple machine allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for the same amount of [[work (physics)|work]]. Analysis of the characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in the work of [[Archimedes]] who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of [[buoyant force]]s inherent in [[fluid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archimedes&quot;/&gt;

[[Aristotle]] provided a [[philosophical]] discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotelian cosmology]]. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four [[Classical element|elements]] that come to rest at different &quot;natural places&quot; therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their &quot;natural place&quot; (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to &quot;natural motion&quot;, and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lang|first=Helen S.|title=The order of nature in Aristotle's physics : place and the elements|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521624534|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of [[projectile]]s, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hetherington&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Norriss S. |last=Hetherington |title=Cosmology: Historical, Literary, Philosophical, Religious, and Scientific Perspectives |page=100 |publisher= Garland Reference Library of the Humanities |year=1993 |isbn=0-8153-1085-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotelian physics]] began facing criticism in [[Science in the Middle Ages|Medieval science]], first by [[John Philoponus]] in the 6th century.

The shortcomings of Aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of [[Galileo Galilei]], who was influenced by the late Medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of [[impetus theory|impetus]]. Galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the [[Aristotelian theory of gravity|Aristotelian theory of motion]] early in the 17th century. He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their [[velocity]] unless acted on by a force, for example [[friction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Galileo&quot;&gt;Drake, Stillman (1978). Galileo At Work. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. ISBN 0-226-16226-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newtonian mechanics==
{{main|Newton's laws of motion}}
Sir Isaac Newton sought to describe the motion of all objects using the concepts of [[inertia]] and force, and in doing so he found that they obey certain [[conservation laws]]. In 1687, Newton went on to publish his thesis ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Principia&quot;&gt;{{Cite book
|last=Newton
|first=Isaac
|author-link= Isaac Newton
|title=The Principia Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy
|publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |location=Berkeley
|isbn=0-520-08817-4}} This is a recent translation into English by I. Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, with help from Julia Budenz.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work Newton set out three laws of motion that to this day are the way forces are described in physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principia&quot;/&gt;

===First law===
{{main|Newton's first law}}
Newton's First Law of Motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external [[net force]] or ''resultant force''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principia&quot;/&gt; This law is an extension of Galileo's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force (see [[#Dynamic equilibrium|a more detailed description of this below]]). Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate [[inertia]] that functions as the fundamental equilibrium &quot;natural state&quot; in place of the Aristotelian idea of the &quot;natural state of rest&quot;. That is, the first law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity. By making ''rest'' physically indistinguishable from ''non-zero constant velocity'', Newton's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of [[Galilean relativity|relative velocities]]. Specifically, in systems where objects are moving with different velocities, it is impossible to determine which object is &quot;in motion&quot; and which object is &quot;at rest&quot;. In other words, to phrase matters more technically, the laws of physics are the same in every [[inertial frame of reference]], that is, in all frames related by a [[Galilean transformation]].

For instance, while traveling in a moving vehicle at a [[wikt:Constant|constant]] [[velocity]], the laws of physics do not change from being at rest. A person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving [[parabola|parabolic path]] in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be [[Galilean equivalence|physically indistinguishable]]. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.

The concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion, even those that are not strictly constant velocity. The [[rotational inertia]] of planet Earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year. Albert Einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration, such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object, were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames. This is why, for example, astronauts experience [[weightlessness]] when in free-fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments. If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next to himself, it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia. This is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame. This [[principle of equivalence]] was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the [[general theory of relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert |last=DiSalle |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-iframes/ |accessdate=2008-03-24 |title=Space and Time: Inertial Frames |date=2002-03-30 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|right|thumb|Though [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s most famous equation is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\vec{F}=m\vec{a}}&lt;/math&gt;, he actually wrote down a different form for his second law of motion that did not use [[differential calculus]].]]

===Second law===
{{main|Newton's second law}}
A modern statement of Newton's Second Law is a vector equation:&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Newton's ''Principia Mathematica'' actually used a finite difference version of this equation based upon ''impulse''. See ''[[Newton's laws of motion#Impulse|Impulse]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[momentum]] of the system, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the net ([[Vector (geometric)#Addition and subtraction|vector sum]]) force. In equilibrium, there is zero ''net'' force by definition, but (balanced) forces may be present nevertheless. In contrast, the second law states an ''unbalanced'' force acting on an object will result in the object's momentum changing over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principia&quot;/&gt;

By the definition of [[Momentum#Linear momentum of a particle|momentum]],
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left(m\vec{v}\right)}{\mathrm{d}t},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the [[mass]] and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[velocity]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1/&gt;{{rp|9-1,9-2}}

Newton's second law applies only to a system of [[Newton's Laws of Motion#Open systems|constant mass]],&lt;ref name=Halliday group=Note&gt;&quot;It is important to note that we ''cannot'' derive a general expression for Newton's second law for variable mass systems by treating the mass in '''F''' = ''d'''''P'''/''dt'' = ''d''(''M'''''v''') as a ''variable''. [...] We ''can'' use '''F''' = ''d'''''P'''/''dt'' to analyze variable mass systems ''only'' if we apply it to an ''entire system of constant mass'' having parts among which there is an interchange of mass.&quot; [Emphasis as in the original] {{harv|Halliday|Resnick |Krane|2001|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence ''m'' may be moved outside the derivative operator. The equation then becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = m\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;
By substituting the definition of [[acceleration]], the algebraic version of [[Newton's Second Law]] is derived:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} =m\vec{a}.&lt;/math&gt;
Newton never explicitly stated the formula in the reduced form above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howland|first=R. A.|title=Intermediate dynamics a linear algebraic approach|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9780387280592|pages=255&amp;ndash;256|edition=Online-Ausg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through [[kinematic]] measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through [[frame of reference|reference frame]] analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass. [[General relativity]] offers an equivalence between [[space-time]] and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of [[quantum gravity]], it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of ''mass'' by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.

The use of Newton's Second Law as a ''definition'' of force has been disparaged in some of the more rigorous textbooks,&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;{{rp|12-1}}&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;{{rp|59}}&lt;ref&gt;One exception to this rule is: {{Cite book |last=Landau |first=L.

Translated by: J. B. Sykes, A. D. Petford, and C. L. Petford. Library of Congress Catalog Number 67-30260. In section 7, pages 12–14, this book defines force as ''dp/dt''.&lt;/ref&gt; because it is essentially a mathematical [[truism]]. Notable physicists, philosophers and mathematicians who have sought a more explicit definition of the concept of force include [[Ernst Mach]], [[Clifford Truesdell]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and [[Walter Noll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jammer|first=Max|title=Concepts of force : a study in the foundations of dynamics|year=1999|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=9780486406893|pages=220–222|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Walter |last=Noll |title=On the Concept of Force |url=http://www.math.cmu.edu/~wn0g/Force.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |date=April 2007 |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's Second Law can be used to measure the strength of forces. For instance, knowledge of the masses of [[planet]]s along with the accelerations of their [[orbit]]s allows scientists to calculate the gravitational forces on planets.

===Third law===
{{main|Newton's third law}}
Newton's Third Law is a result of applying [[symmetry]] to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are ''interactions'' between different bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Whenever a first body exerts a force '''''F''''' on a second body, the second body exerts a force −'''''F''''' on the first body. '''''F''''' and −'''''F''''' are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This law is sometimes referred to as the ''[[Reaction (physics)|action-reaction law]]'', with '''''F''''' called the &quot;action&quot; and −'''''F''''' the &quot;reaction&quot;. The action and the reaction are simultaneous:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{1,2}=-\vec{F}_{2,1}.&lt;/math&gt;

If object 1 and object 2 are considered to be in the same system, then the net force on the system due to the interactions between objects 1 and 2 is zero since
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{1,2}+\vec{F}_{\mathrm{2,1}}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum{\vec{F}}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that in a [[closed system]] of particles, there are no [[internal force]]s that are unbalanced. That is, the action-reaction force shared between any two objects in a closed system will not cause the [[center of mass]] of the system to accelerate. The constituent objects only accelerate with respect to each other, the system itself remains unaccelerated. Alternatively, if an [[external force]] acts on the system, then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;{{rp|19-1}}&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

Combining Newton's Second and Third Laws, it is possible to show that the [[Conservation of momentum|linear momentum of a system is conserved]]. Using
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{1,2} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}_{1,2}}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\vec{F}_{2,1} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}_{2,1}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

and [[integral|integrating]] with respect to time, the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta{\vec{p}_{1,2}} = - \Delta{\vec{p}_{2,1}}&lt;/math&gt;

is obtained. For a system that includes objects 1 and 2,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum{\Delta{\vec{p}}}=\Delta{\vec{p}_{1,2}} + \Delta{\vec{p}_{2,1}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;,

which is the conservation of linear momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dr. Nikitin |title=Dynamics of translational motion |year=2007 |url=http://physics-help.info/physicsguide/mechanics/translational_dynamics.shtml |accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the similar arguments, it is possible to generalize this to a system of an arbitrary number of particles. This shows that exchanging momentum between constituent objects will not affect the net momentum of a system. In general, as long as all forces are due to the interaction of objects with mass, it is possible to define a system such that net momentum is never lost nor gained.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

==Special theory of relativity==
In the [[special theory of relativity]], mass and [[energy]] are equivalent (as can be seen by calculating the work required to accelerate an object). When an object's velocity increases, so does its energy and hence its mass equivalent (inertia). It thus requires more force to accelerate it the same amount than it did at a lower velocity. Newton's Second Law
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \mathrm{d}\vec{p}/\mathrm{d}t&lt;/math&gt;

remains valid because it is a mathematical definition.&lt;ref name=Cutnell&gt;{{harvnb|Cutnell|Johnson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|855–876}} But in order to be conserved, relativistic momentum must be redefined as:
:&lt;math&gt; \vec{p} = \frac{m_0\vec{v}}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity and
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]]
:&lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rest mass]].

The relativistic expression relating force and acceleration for a particle with constant non-zero [[rest mass]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; moving in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction is:
:&lt;math&gt;F_x = \gamma^3 m a_x \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_y = \gamma m a_y \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_z = \gamma m a_z \,&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Lorentz factor]]
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early history of relativity, the expressions &lt;math&gt;\gamma^3 m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma m&lt;/math&gt; were called [[Mass in special relativity#Transverse and longitudinal mass|longitudinal and transverse mass]]. Relativistic force does not produce a constant acceleration, but an ever decreasing acceleration as the object approaches the speed of light. Note that &lt;math&gt; \gamma&lt;/math&gt; is [[Division by zero|undefined]] for an object with a non-zero [[Invariant mass|rest mass]] at the speed of light, and the theory yields no prediction at that speed.

If &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is very small compared to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is very close to 1 and 
:&lt;math&gt;F = m a&lt;/math&gt;
is a close approximation. Even for use in relativity, however, one can restore the form of
:&lt;math&gt;F^\mu = mA^\mu \,&lt;/math&gt;

through the use of [[four-vectors]]. This relation is correct in relativity when &lt;math&gt;F^\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[four-force]], &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[invariant mass]], and &lt;math&gt;A^\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[four-acceleration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Descriptions==
[[File:Freebodydiagram3 pn.svg|thumb|right|[[Diagram]]s of a block on a flat surface and an [[inclined plane]]. Forces are resolved and added together to determine their magnitudes and the net force.]]
Since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt; As with other physical concepts (e.g. [[temperature]]), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise [[operational definition]]s that are consistent with direct [[sensory perception|observations]] and [[measurement|compared to a standard measurement scale]]. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the [[conceptual definition]] of force offered by [[#Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]].

Forces act in a particular [[direction (geometry)|direction]] and have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|sizes]] dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as &quot;[[Euclidean vector|vector quantities]]&quot;. This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the [[resultant|result]]. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in [[tug of war]] or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple [[one-dimensional]] example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.

Historically, forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of [[static equilibrium]] where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive [[Vector (geometric)|vector quantities]]: they have [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and direction.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt; When two forces act on a [[point particle]], the resulting force, the ''resultant'' (also called the ''[[net force]]''), can be determined by following the [[parallelogram rule]] of [[vector addition]]: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt; The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body.

[[Free-body diagram]]s can be used as a convenient way to keep track of forces acting on a system. Ideally, these diagrams are drawn with the angles and relative magnitudes of the force vectors preserved so that [[Vector (geometric)|graphical vector addition]] can be done to determine the net force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As well as being added, forces can also be resolved into independent components at [[right angle]]s to each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of [[basis vector]]s is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because, for [[orthogonal]] components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Equilibrium===
[[Mechanical equilibrium|Equilibrium]] occurs when the resultant force acting on a point particle is zero (that is, the vector sum of all forces is zero). When dealing with an extended body, it is also necessary that the net torque in it is 0.

There are two kinds of equilibrium: [[static equilibrium]] and [[#Dynamic equilibrium|dynamic equilibrium]].

===={{anchor|Static equilibrium}}Static====
{{main|Statics|Static equilibrium}}
Static equilibrium was understood well before the invention of classical mechanics. Objects that are at rest have zero net force acting on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Static Equilibrium
|work=Physics Static Equilibrium (forces and torques)
|publisher=[[University of the Virgin Islands]]
|url=http://www.uvi.edu/Physics/SCI3xxWeb/Structure/StaticEq.html
|accessdate=2008-01-02 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071019054156/http://www.uvi.edu/Physics/SCI3xxWeb/Structure/StaticEq.html |archivedate=October 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest case of static equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object on a level surface is pulled (attracted) downward toward the center of the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, surface forces resist the downward force with equal upward force (called the [[normal force]]). The situation is one of zero net force and no acceleration.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt;

Pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by [[static friction]], generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force ''exactly'' balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt;

A static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces, using simple devices such as [[weighing scale]]s and [[spring balance]]s. For example, an object suspended on a vertical [[spring scale]] experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the &quot;spring reaction force&quot;, which equals the object's weight. Using such tools, some quantitative force laws were discovered: that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant [[density]] (widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights); [[Archimedes' principle]] for buoyancy; Archimedes' analysis of the [[lever]]; [[Boyle's law]] for gas pressure; and [[Hooke's law]] for springs. These were all formulated and experimentally verified before Isaac Newton expounded his [[Newton's Laws of Motion|Three Laws of Motion]].&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===={{anchor|Dynamical equilibrium|Dynamic equilibrium}}Dynamic====
{{main|Dynamics (physics)}}
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|[[Galileo Galilei]] was the first to point out the inherent contradictions contained in Aristotle's description of forces.]]
Dynamic equilibrium was first described by [[Galileo]] who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and [[logic]]. Galileo realized that [[Galilean relativity|simple velocity addition]] demands that the concept of an &quot;absolute [[rest frame]]&quot; did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a constant [[velocity]] was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a &quot;natural state&quot; of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galileo&quot;/&gt;

Moreover, any object traveling at a constant velocity must be subject to zero net force (resultant force). This is the definition of dynamic equilibrium: when all the forces on an object balance but it still moves at a constant velocity.

A simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with [[kinetic friction]]. In such a situation, a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Forces in Quantum Mechanics===
{{main|Quantum mechanics|Pauli principle}}
The notion &quot;force&quot; keeps its meaning in [[quantum mechanics]], though one is now dealing with operators  instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the [[Schrödinger equation]] instead of [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian equations]]. This has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes &quot;quantized&quot;, i.e. they appear in discrete portions. This is, of course, difficult to imagine in the context of &quot;forces&quot;. However, the [[potential]]s V(x,y,z) or [[field (physics)|field]]s, from which the forces generally can be derived, are treated similar to classical position variables, i.e., &lt;math&gt;V(x,y,z)\to {\hat V}(\hat x,\hat y,\hat z)&lt;/math&gt;.

This becomes different only in the framework of [[quantum field theory]], where these fields are also quantized.

However, already in quantum mechanics there is one &quot;caveat&quot;, namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but also a discrete  intrinsic [[angular momentum|angular momentum-like]] variable called the &quot;[[Spin (physics)|spin]]&quot;, and there is the [[Pauli principle]] relating the space and the spin variables. Depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, [[fermion]]s and [[boson]]s.  If two identical fermions (e.g. electrons) have a ''symmetric'' spin function (e.g.  parallel spins) the spatial variables must be ''antisymmetric'' (i.e. they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force), and vice versa, i.e. for antiparallel ''spins'' the ''position variables'' must be symmetric (i.e. the appearant force must be attractive). Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables, whereas for two bosons (e.g. quanta of electromagnetic waves, photons) the correlation is strictly positive.

Thus the notion &quot;force&quot; loses already part of its meaning.

===Feynman diagrams===
{{main|Feynman diagrams}}
[[File:Beta Negative Decay.svg|thumb|right|Feynman diagram for the decay of a neutron into a proton. The [[W boson]] is between two vertices indicating a repulsion.]]
In modern [[particle physics]], forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying [[gauge boson]]s. With the development of [[quantum field theory]] and [[general relativity]], it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from [[conservation of momentum]] ([[4-momentum]] in relativity and momentum of [[virtual particle]]s in [[quantum electrodynamics]]). The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of [[space]] and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force. Thus the currently known [[fundamental forces]] are considered more accurately to be &quot;[[fundamental interactions]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;final theory&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg |first=S. |year=1994 |title=Dreams of a Final Theory |publisher=Vintage Books USA |isbn=0-679-74408-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|199–128}} When particle A emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) virtual particle B, a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A' exchanging by B. This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see [[world line]]) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines. Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and, in the case of virtual particle exchange, are absorbed at an adjacent vertex.&lt;ref name=Shifman&gt;{{cite book |first=Mikhail |last=Shifman |title=ITEP lectures on particle physics and field theory |publisher=World Scientific |year=1999 |isbn=981-02-2639-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utility of Feynman diagrams is that other types of physical phenomena that are part of the general picture of [[fundamental interaction]]s but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules. For example, a Feynman diagram can describe in succinct detail how a [[neutron]] [[beta decay|decays]] into an [[electron]], [[proton]], and [[neutrino]], an interaction mediated by the same gauge boson that is responsible for the [[weak nuclear force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shifman&quot;/&gt;

==Fundamental forces==
{{main|Fundamental interaction}} 
All of the forces in the universe are based on four [[fundamental interaction]]s. The [[strong force|strong]] and [[weak force|weak]] forces are [[nuclear force]]s that act only at very short distances, and are responsible for the interactions between [[subatomic particle]]s, including [[nucleons]] and compound [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. The [[electromagnetic force]] acts between [[electric charge]]s, and the [[gravitational force]] acts between [[mass]]es. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, [[friction]] is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the [[atom]]s of two [[surface]]s, and the [[Pauli exclusion principle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl Rod |title=Pauli Exclusion Principle |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=University of Guelph |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pauli.html |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in [[spring (device)|springs]], modeled by [[Hooke's law]], are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] position. [[Centrifugal force (fictitious)|Centrifugal forces]] are [[acceleration]] forces that arise simply from the acceleration of [[rotation|rotating]] [[frames of reference]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;{{rp|12-11}}&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;{{rp|359}}

The development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of [[Unified field theory|unification]] of disparate ideas. For example, Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation. [[Michael Faraday]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of [[quantum mechanics]] led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter ([[fermion]]s) interacting by exchanging [[virtual particle]]s called [[gauge boson]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fermions &amp; Bosons |work=The Particle Adventure |url=http://particleadventure.org/frameless/fermibos.html |accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[standard model]] of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in [[electroweak]] theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved [[Higgs mechanism]], but observations such as [[neutrino oscillation]]s indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A [[Grand Unified Theory]] allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as [[supersymmetry]] proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding [[unsolved problems in physics]]. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a [[theory of everything]]. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is [[string theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;final theory&quot;/&gt;{{rp|212–219}}

===Gravitational===
{{main|Gravity}}
[[File:Falling ball.jpg|upright|thumb|Images of a freely falling basketball taken with a [[stroboscope]] at 20 flashes per second. The distance units on the right are multiples of about 12&amp;nbsp;millimetres. The basketball starts at rest.  At the time of the first flash (distance zero) it is released, after which the number of units fallen is equal to the square of the number of flashes.]]
What we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of Isaac Newton. Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects. Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the [[acceleration]] of every object in [[free-fall]] was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration due to gravity]] towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{g}&lt;/math&gt; and has a magnitude of about 9.81 [[meter]]s per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=A. H. |journal=Nature |title=A New Absolute Determination of the Acceleration due to Gravity at the National Physical Laboratory |date=1965|doi=10.1038/208279a0 |page=279 |volume=208 |bibcode=1965Natur.208..279C |issue=5007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth's surface is directly proportional to the object's mass. Thus an object that has a mass of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; will experience a force:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = m\vec{g}&lt;/math&gt;

In free-fall, this force is unopposed and therefore the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, the force of gravity is opposed by the reactions of their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since his weight is balanced by a [[normal force]] exerted by the ground.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

Newton's contribution to gravitational theory was to unify the motions of heavenly bodies, which Aristotle had assumed were in a natural state of constant motion, with falling motion observed on the Earth. He proposed a [[Newton's law of gravity|law of gravity]] that could account for the celestial motions that had been described earlier using [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch4 /&gt;

Newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances. In particular, Newton determined that the acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an [[inverse square law]]. Further, Newton realized that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the attracting body.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch4 /&gt; Combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_\oplus&lt;/math&gt;) and the radius (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_\oplus&lt;/math&gt;) of the Earth to the gravitational acceleration:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{g}=-\frac{Gm_\oplus}{{R_\oplus}^2} \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where the vector direction is given by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[unit vector]] directed outward from the center of the Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principia&quot;/&gt;

In this equation, a dimensional constant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is used to describe the relative strength of gravity. This constant has come to be known as [[Newton's Universal Gravitation Constant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Not until 1798 was [[Henry Cavendish]] able to make the first measurement of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; using a [[torsion balance]]; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the Earth since knowing &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; could allow one to solve for the Earth's mass given the above equation. Newton, however, realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same [[Kepler's laws|laws of motion]], his law of gravity had to be universal. Succinctly stated, [[Newton's Law of Gravitation]] states that the force on a spherical object of mass &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; due to the gravitational pull of mass &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}=-\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^2} \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the two objects' centers of mass and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector pointed in the direction away from the center of the first object toward the center of the second object.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principia&quot;/&gt;

This formula was powerful enough to stand as the basis for all subsequent descriptions of motion within the solar system until the 20th century. During that time, sophisticated methods of [[perturbation analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was only the orbit of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] that Newton's Law of Gravitation seemed not to fully explain. Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet ([[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]]) that would explain the discrepancies; however, despite some early indications, no such planet could be found. When [[Albert Einstein]] formulated his theory of [[general relativity]] (GR) he turned his attention to the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|a correction, which could account for the discrepancy]]. This was the first time that Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be less correct than an alternative.&lt;ref name=Ein1916&gt;{{cite journal |last=Einstein |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=49 |pages=769–822 |year=1916 |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |format=PDF |accessdate=2006-09-03 |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, and so far, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in [[geodesic|straight lines]] through [[curved space-time]] – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ''[[external ballistics|ballistic]] [[trajectory]]'' of the object. For example, a [[basketball]] thrown from the ground moves in a [[parabola]], as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] of the order of few [[light-year]]s). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as &quot;gravitational force&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Electromagnetic===
{{main|Electromagnetic force}}
The [[electrostatic force]] was first described in 1784 by Coulomb as a force that existed intrinsically between two [[electric charge|charges]].&lt;ref name=Cutnell/&gt;{{rp|519}} The properties of the electrostatic force were that it varied as an [[inverse square law]] directed in the [[polar coordinates|radial direction]], was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic [[Electrical polarity|polarity]]), was independent of the mass of the charged objects, and followed the [[superposition principle]]. [[Coulomb's law]] unifies all these observations into one succinct statement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulomb&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Charles |last=Coulomb |journal=Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |year=1784 |title=Recherches théoriques et expérimentales sur la force de torsion et sur l'élasticité des fils de metal |pages=229–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent mathematicians and physicists found the construct of the ''[[electric field]]'' to be useful for determining the electrostatic force on an electric charge at any point in space. The electric field was based on using a hypothetical &quot;[[test charge]]&quot; anywhere in space and then using Coulomb's Law to determine the electrostatic force.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol2/&gt;{{rp|4-6 to 4-8}} Thus the electric field anywhere in space is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = {\vec{F} \over{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the hypothetical test charge.

Meanwhile, the [[Lorentz force]] of [[magnetism]] was discovered to exist between two [[electric current]]s. It has the same mathematical character as Coulomb's Law with the proviso that like currents attract and unlike currents repel. Similar to the electric field, the [[magnetic field]] can be used to determine the magnetic force on an electric current at any point in space. In this case, the magnitude of the magnetic field was determined to be
:&lt;math&gt;B = {F \over{I \ell}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the hypothetical test current and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \ell&lt;/math&gt; is the length of hypothetical wire through which the test current flows. The magnetic field exerts a force on all [[magnet]]s including, for example, those used in [[compass]]es. The fact that the [[geomagnetism|Earth's magnetic field]] is aligned closely with the orientation of the Earth's [[rotation|axis]] causes compass magnets to become oriented because of the magnetic force pulling on the needle.

Through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge, a rule of [[Cross product|vector multiplication]] called [[Lorentz force|Lorentz's Law]] describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol2/&gt; The connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified ''electromagnetic force'' that acts on a charge. This force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force (due to the electric field) and the magnetic force (due to the magnetic field). Fully stated, this is the law:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the electromagnetic force, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the charge of the particle, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric field, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[velocity]] of the particle that is [[cross product|crossed]] with the magnetic field (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;).

The origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when [[James Clerk Maxwell]] unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by [[Oliver Heaviside]] and [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This led Maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be &quot;self-generating&quot; through a [[wave]] that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the [[speed of light]]. This insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with [[optics]] and led directly to a complete description of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;

However, attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations, the [[photoelectric effect]], and the nonexistence of the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], proved troublesome. Through the work of leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to [[quantum electrodynamics]] (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as [[photon]]s. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;For a complete library on quantum mechanics see [[Quantum mechanics#References|Quantum mechanics – References]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of [[solid state physics|solid matter]] to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force. However, these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Since electrons are [[fermion]]s, they cannot occupy the same [[wavefunction|quantum mechanical state]] as other electrons. When the electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states. This means that it takes energy to pack them together. While this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force, it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states.

===Strong nuclear===
{{main|Strong interaction}}
There are two &quot;[[nuclear force]]s&quot;, which today are usually described as interactions that take place in quantum theories of particle physics. The [[strong nuclear force]]&lt;ref name=Cutnell/&gt;{{rp|940}} is the force responsible for the structural integrity of [[atomic nuclei]] while the [[weak nuclear force]]&lt;ref name=Cutnell/&gt;{{rp|951}} is responsible for the decay of certain [[nucleon]]s into [[lepton]]s and other types of [[hadron]]s.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

The strong force is today understood to represent the [[interaction]]s between [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s as detailed by the theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong force is the [[fundamental force]] mediated by [[gluons]], acting upon quarks, [[antiparticle|antiquarks]], and the [[gluon]]s themselves. The (aptly named) strong interaction is the &quot;strongest&quot; of the four fundamental forces.

The strong force only acts ''directly'' upon elementary particles. However, a residual of the force is observed between [[hadron]]s (the best known example being the force that acts between [[nucleon]]s in atomic nuclei) as the [[nuclear force]]. Here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho [[meson]]s, which classically transmit the nuclear force (see this topic for more). The failure of many searches for [[free quark]]s has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable. This phenomenon is called [[color confinement]]. 

===Weak nuclear===
{{Main|Weak interaction}}
The weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy [[W and Z bosons]]. Its most familiar effect is [[beta decay]] (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated [[radioactivity]]. The word &quot;weak&quot; derives from the fact that the field strength is some 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; times less than that of the [[strong force]]. Still, it is stronger than gravity over short distances. A consistent electroweak theory has also been developed, which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]]s. Such temperatures have been probed in modern [[particle accelerator]]s and show the conditions of the [[universe]] in the early moments of the [[Big Bang]].

==Non-fundamental forces==
Some forces are consequences of the fundamental ones. In such situations, idealized models can be utilized to gain physical insight.

===Normal force===
[[File:Incline.svg|right|thumb|''F&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the [[normal force]] exerted on the object.]]
{{main|Normal force}}
The normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to [[fermion]]ic nature of [[electron]]s) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the surface interface between two objects.&lt;ref name=Cutnell/&gt;{{rp|93}} The normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Friction===
{{main|Friction}}
Friction is a surface force that opposes relative motion. The frictional force is directly related to the normal force that acts to keep two solid objects separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of frictional forces: [[static friction]] and [[kinetic friction]].

The static friction force (&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{sf}}&lt;/math&gt;) will exactly oppose forces applied to an object parallel to a surface contact up to the limit specified by the [[coefficient of static friction]] (&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{sf}}&lt;/math&gt;) multiplied by the normal force (&lt;math&gt;F_N&lt;/math&gt;). In other words, the magnitude of the static friction force satisfies the inequality:
:&lt;math&gt;0 \le F_{\mathrm{sf}} \le \mu_{\mathrm{sf}} F_\mathrm{N}.&lt;/math&gt;

The kinetic friction force (&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{kf}}&lt;/math&gt;) is independent of both the forces applied and the movement of the object. Thus, the magnitude of the force equals:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{kf}} = \mu_{\mathrm{kf}} F_\mathrm{N},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{kf}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coefficient of kinetic friction]]. For most surface interfaces, the coefficient of kinetic friction is less than the coefficient of static friction.

===Tension===
{{main|Tension (physics)}}
Tension forces can be modeled using [[ideal string]]s that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be combined with ideal [[pulley]]s, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an [[mechanical advantage|increase in force]], there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the [[conservation of energy|conservation of mechanical energy]] since the [[#Kinematic integrals|work done on the load]] is the same no matter how complicated the machine.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Elastic force===
{{main|Elasticity (physics)|Hooke's law}}
[[File:Mass-spring-system.png|upright|thumb|''F&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the force that responds to the load on the spring]]
An elastic force acts to return a [[Spring (device)|spring]] to its natural length. An [[ideal spring]] is taken to be massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and infinitely stretchable. Such springs exert forces that push when contracted, or pull when extended, in proportion to the [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement]] of the spring from its equilibrium position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl Rod |title=Elasticity |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=University of Guelph |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/permot2.html |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This linear relationship was described by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1676, for whom [[Hooke's law]] is named. If &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement, the force exerted by an ideal spring equals:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}=-k \Delta \vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the spring constant (or force constant), which is particular to the spring. The minus sign accounts for the tendency of the force to act in opposition to the applied load.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Continuum mechanics===
[[File:Stokes sphere.svg|thumb|upright|When the drag force (&lt;math&gt;F_d&lt;/math&gt;) associated with air resistance becomes equal in magnitude to the force of gravity on a falling object (&lt;math&gt;F_g&lt;/math&gt;), the object reaches a state of [[#Dynamic equilibrium|dynamic equilibrium]] at [[terminal velocity]].]]
{{main|Pressure|Drag (physics)|Stress (mechanics)}}
Newton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized [[point particle]]s rather than three-dimensional objects. However, in real life, matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object. For situations where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to flow, contract, expand, or otherwise change shape, the theories of [[continuum mechanics]] describe the way forces affect the material. For example, in extended [[fluid mechanics|fluids]], differences in [[pressure]] result in forces being directed along the pressure [[gradient]]s as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\vec{F}}{V} = - \vec{\nabla} P&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the object in the fluid and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scalar function]] that describes the pressure at all locations in space. Pressure gradients and differentials result in the [[buoyancy|buoyant force]] for fluids suspended in gravitational fields, winds in [[atmospheric science]], and the [[lift (physics)|lift]] associated with [[aerodynamics]] and [[flight]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

A specific instance of such a force that is associated with [[dynamic pressure]] is fluid resistance: a body force that resists the motion of an object through a fluid due to [[viscosity]]. For so-called &quot;[[Drag (physics)#Very low Reynolds numbers—Stokes' drag|Stokes' drag]]&quot; the force is approximately proportional to the velocity, but opposite in direction:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_\mathrm{d} = - b \vec{v} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is a constant that depends on the properties of the fluid and the dimensions of the object (usually the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]]), and
:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the object.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

More formally, forces in [[continuum mechanics]] are fully described by a [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]–[[tensor]] with terms that are roughly defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the relevant cross-sectional area for the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated. This formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area (the [[matrix diagonal]]s of the tensor) as well as [[Shear stress|shear]] terms associated with forces that act [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the cross-sectional area (the off-diagonal elements). The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all [[strain (physics)|strains]] (deformations) including also [[tensile stress]]es and [[compression (physical)|compressions]].&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2&gt;''University Physics'', Sears, Young &amp; Zemansky, pp.18–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner&gt;{{harvnb|Kleppner|Kolenkow|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–134}}&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol2&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman volume 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38-1–38-11}}

===Fictitious forces===
{{main|Fictitious forces}}
There are forces that are [[frame dependent]], meaning that they appear due to the adoption of non-Newtonian (that is, [[non-inertial frame|non-inertial]]) [[Frame of reference|reference frames]]. Such forces include the [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]] and the [[Coriolis force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mallette |first=Vincent |title=Inwit Publishing, Inc. and Inwit, LLC – Writings, Links and Software Distributions – The Coriolis Force |work=Publications in Science and Mathematics, Computing and the Humanities |publisher=Inwit Publishing, Inc. |date=1982–2008 |url=http://www.algorithm.com/inwit/writings/coriolisforce.html |accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forces are considered fictitious because they do not exist in frames of reference that are not accelerating.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt; Because these forces are not genuine they are also referred to as &quot;pseudo forces&quot;.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;{{rp|12-11}}

In [[general relativity]], [[gravity]] becomes a fictitious force that arises in situations where spacetime deviates from a flat geometry. As an extension, [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] and [[string theory]] ascribe electromagnetism and the other [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] respectively to the curvature of differently scaled dimensions, which would ultimately imply that all forces are fictitious.

==Rotations and torque==
[[File:Torque animation.gif|frame|right|Relationship between force (F), torque (τ), and [[angular momentum|momentum]] vectors (p and L) in a rotating system.]]
{{main|Torque}}
Forces that cause extended objects to rotate are associated with [[torque]]s. Mathematically, the torque of a force &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is defined relative to an arbitrary reference point as the [[cross-product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[position vector]] of the force application point relative to the reference point.

Torque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that [[angle]] is the rotational equivalent for [[position (vector)|position]], [[angular velocity]] for [[velocity]], and [[angular momentum]] for [[momentum]]. As a consequence of Newton's First Law of Motion, there exists [[rotational inertia]] that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque. Likewise, Newton's Second Law of Motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous [[angular acceleration]] of the rigid body:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\tau} = I\vec{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body
:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the angular acceleration of the body.

This provides a definition for the moment of inertia, which is the rotational equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the rotation over a time interval is described, the moment of inertia must be substituted by the [[Moment of inertia tensor|tensor]] that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the characteristics of rotations including [[precession]] and [[nutation]].

Equivalently, the differential form of Newton's Second Law provides an alternative definition of torque:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\tau} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{L}}{\mathrm{dt}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl Rod |title=Newton's 2nd Law: Rotation |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=University of Guelph |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/n2r.html |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the angular momentum of the particle.

Newton's Third Law of Motion requires that all objects exerting torques themselves experience equal and opposite torques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Richard |title=Newton's third law of motion |date=2007-01-07 |url=http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336k/lectures/node26.html |accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore also directly implies the [[conservation of angular momentum]] for closed systems that experience rotations and [[revolution]]s through the action of internal torques.

===Centripetal force===
{{main|Centripetal force}}
For an object accelerating in circular motion, the unbalanced force acting on the object equals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl Rod |title=Centripetal Force |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=University of Guelph |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/cf.html |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = - \frac{mv^2 \hat{r}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the object and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the center of the circular path and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit vector]] pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center. This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the [[speed]] of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

==Kinematic integrals==
{{main|Impulse (physics)|l1=Impulse|Mechanical work|Power (physics)}}
Forces can be used to define a number of physical concepts by [[integration (calculus)|integrating]] with respect to [[kinematics|kinematic variables]]. For example, integrating with respect to time gives the definition of [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{I}=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{\vec{F} \mathrm{d}t},&lt;/math&gt;

which by Newton's Second Law must be equivalent to the change in momentum (yielding the [[Impulse momentum theorem]]).

Similarly, integrating with respect to position gives a definition for the [[work (physics)|work done]] by a force:&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1/&gt;{{rp|13-3}}
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int_{\vec{x}_1}^{\vec{x}_2}{\vec{F} \cdot{\mathrm{d}\vec{x}}},&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to changes in [[kinetic energy]] (yielding the [[work energy theorem]]).&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1/&gt;{{rp|13-3}}

[[Power (physics)|Power]] ''P'' is the rate of change d''W''/d''t'' of the work ''W'', as the [[trajectory]] is extended by a position change &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle {d}\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; in a time interval d''t'':&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1/&gt;{{rp|13-2}}
:&lt;math&gt;
  \text{d}W\, =\, \frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}\vec{x}}\, \cdot\, \text{d}\vec{x}\, =\, \vec{F}\, \cdot\, \text{d}\vec{x},
  \qquad \text{ so } \quad
  P\, =\, \frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}t}\, =\, \frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}\vec{x}}\, \cdot\, \frac{\text{d}\vec{x}}{\text{d}t}\, =\, \vec{F}\, \cdot\, \vec{v},
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;{\vec{v}\text{ }=\text{ d}\vec{x}/\text{d}t}&lt;/math&gt; the [[velocity]].

==Potential energy==
{{main|Potential energy}}
Instead of a force, often the mathematically related concept of a [[potential energy]] field can be used for convenience. For instance, the gravitational force acting upon an object can be seen as the action of the [[gravitational field]] that is present at the object's location. Restating mathematically the definition of energy (via the definition of [[Mechanical work|work]]), a potential [[scalar field]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{U(\vec{r})}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as that field whose [[gradient]] is equal and opposite to the force produced at every point:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}=-\vec{\nabla} U.&lt;/math&gt;

Forces can be classified as [[Conservative force|conservative]] or nonconservative. Conservative forces are equivalent to the gradient of a [[potential]] while nonconservative forces are not.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Conservative forces===
{{main|Conservative force}}
A conservative force that acts on a [[closed system]] has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] or [[potential energy|potential]] forms. This means that for a closed system, the net [[mechanical energy]] is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last=Singh
|first=Sunil Kumar
|title=Conservative force

|date=2007-08-25
|url=http://cnx.org/content/m14104/latest/
|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the [[contour map]] of the elevation of an area.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

Conservative forces include [[gravity]], the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] force, and the [[Hooke's law|spring]] force. Each of these forces has models that are dependent on a position often given as a [[radius|radial vector]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; emanating from [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetric]] potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For gravity:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = - \frac{G m_1 m_2 \vec{r}}{r^3}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]], and &lt;math&gt;m_n&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of object ''n''.

For electrostatic forces:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{q_{1} q_{2} \vec{r}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} r^3}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Permittivity|electric permittivity of free space]], and &lt;math&gt;q_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric charge]] of object ''n''.

For spring forces:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = - k \vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[spring constant]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Nonconservative forces===
For certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the [[atom]]s, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other [[contact force]]s, [[Tension (physics)|tension]], [[Physical compression|compression]], and [[drag (physics)|drag]]. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

The connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with [[statistical mechanics]]. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the [[internal energy|internal energies]] of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the [[Second law of thermodynamics]], nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as [[entropy]] increases.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

==Units of measurement==
The [[SI]] unit of force is the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (symbol N), which is the force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second squared, or {{math|kg·m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name= metric_units&gt;{{cite book |first=Cornelius |last=Wandmacher |first2=Arnold |last2=Johnson |title=Metric Units in Engineering |page=15 |year=1995 |publisher=ASCE Publications |isbn=0-7844-0070-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding [[CGS]] unit is the [[dyne]], the force required to accelerate a one gram mass by one centimeter per second squared, or {{math|g·cm·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A newton is thus equal to 100,000&amp;nbsp;dynes.

The gravitational [[foot-pound-second]] [[English unit]] of force is the [[pound-force]] (lbf), defined as the force exerted by gravity on a [[pound-mass]] in the [[Standard gravity|standard gravitational]] field of {{math|9.80665&amp;nbsp;m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=metric_units/&gt; The pound-force provides an alternative unit of mass: one [[slug (mass)|slug]] is the mass that will accelerate by one foot per second squared when acted on by one pound-force.&lt;ref name=metric_units/&gt;

An alternative unit of force in a different foot-pound-second system, the absolute fps system, is the [[poundal]], defined as the force required to accelerate a one-pound mass at a rate of one foot per second squared.&lt;ref name=metric_units/&gt; The units of [[slug (mass)|slug]] and [[poundal]] are designed to avoid a constant of proportionality in [[Newton's Second Law]].

The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton: the [[kilogram-force]] (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass.&lt;ref name= metric_units/&gt; The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the [[metric slug]] (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at {{math|1&amp;nbsp;m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} when subjected to a force of 1&amp;nbsp;kgf. The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the [[sthène]], which is equivalent to 1000&amp;nbsp;N, and the [[kip (unit)|kip]], which is equivalent to 1000&amp;nbsp;lbf.

In [[electromagnetism]], '''absolute permittivity''' is the measure of  resistance that is encountered when forming an electric field in a medium. In other words, permittivity is a measure of how an [[electric field]] affects, and is affected by, a [[dielectric]] medium. The permittivity of a medium describes how much electric field (more correctly, flux) is 'generated' per unit charge in that medium. More [[electric flux]] exists in a medium with a low permittivity (per unit charge) because of polarization effects. Permittivity is directly related to [[electric susceptibility]], which is a measure of how easily a dielectric [[polarization density|polarizes]] in response to an [[electric field]]. Thus, permittivity relates to a material's ability to '''resist''' an electric field (while unfortunately the word stem &quot;permit&quot; suggests the inverse quantity).

In [[SI]] units, permittivity ''ε'' is measured in [[farad]]s per [[meter]] (F/m); electric susceptibility ''χ'' is dimensionless. They are related to each other through
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \varepsilon_{\text{r}} \varepsilon_0 = (1+\chi)\varepsilon_0 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[relative permittivity]] of the material, and ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.8541878176.. × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; F/m is the [[vacuum permittivity]].

==Explanation==

In [[electromagnetism]], the [[electric displacement field]] '''D''' represents how an electric field '''E''' influences the organization of electric charges in a given medium, including charge migration and electric [[dipole]] reorientation. Its relation to permittivity in the very simple case of ''linear, homogeneous, [[isotropic]]'' materials with ''&quot;instantaneous&quot; response'' to changes in electric field is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}=\varepsilon \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;

where the permittivity ''ε'' is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]. If the medium is anisotropic, the permittivity is a second rank [[tensor]].

In general, permittivity is not a constant, as it can vary with the position in the medium, the frequency of the field applied, humidity, temperature, and other parameters. In a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear medium]], the permittivity can depend on the strength of the electric field. Permittivity as a function of frequency can take on real or complex values.

In SI units, permittivity is measured in farads per meter (F/m or A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). The displacement field '''D''' is measured in units of [[coulomb]]s per [[square meter]] (C/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while the electric field '''E''' is measured in [[volt]]s per meter (V/m). '''D''' and '''E''' describe the interaction between charged objects. '''D''' is related to the ''charge densities'' associated with this interaction, while '''E''' is related to the ''forces'' and ''potential differences''.

==Vacuum permittivity==

{{main|Vacuum permittivity}}

The vacuum permittivity ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (also called '''permittivity of free space''' or the '''electric constant''') is the ratio '''D'''/'''E''' in [[Vacuum|free space]]. It also appears in the [[Coulomb force constant]], ''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/(4''πε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

Its value is&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?ep0 electric constant]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_0  \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{1}{c_0^2\mu_0} = \frac{1}{35950207149.4727056\pi}\ \frac{\text{F}}{\text{m}} \approx 8.8541878176\ldots\times 10^{-12}\ \text{F/m} &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[speed of light]] in free space,&lt;ref&gt;Current practice of standards organizations such as [[NIST]] and [[BIPM]] is to use ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, rather than ''c'', to denote the speed of light in vacuum according to [[ISO 31]]. In the original Recommendation of 1983, the symbol ''c'' was used for this purpose. See [http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf NIST ''Special Publication 330'', Appendix 2, p. 45 ].&lt;/ref&gt;
:''µ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permeability]].
Constants ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are defined in SI units to have exact numerical values, shifting responsibility of experiment to the determination of the meter and the [[ampere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html Latest (2006) values of the constants (NIST)]&lt;/ref&gt; (The approximation in the second value of ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; above stems from ''π'' being an [[irrational number]].)

==Relative permittivity==
{{main|Relative permittivity}}

The linear permittivity of a homogeneous material is usually given relative to that of free space, as a relative permittivity ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (also called [[dielectric constant]], although this sometimes only refers to the static, zero-frequency relative permittivity). In an anisotropic material, the relative permittivity may be a tensor, causing [[birefringence]]. The actual permittivity is then calculated by multiplying the relative permittivity by ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \varepsilon_{\text{r}} \varepsilon_0 = (1+\chi)\varepsilon_0,&lt;/math&gt;

where χ (frequently written χ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) is the electric susceptibility of the material.

The susceptibility is defined as the constant of proportionality (which may be a [[tensor]]) relating an [[electric field]] '''E''' to the induced [[dielectric]] [[polarization (electrostatics)|polarization density]] '''P''' such that

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{P} = \varepsilon_0\chi\mathbf{E},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Vacuum permittivity|electric permittivity of free space]].

The susceptibility of a medium is related to its relative permittivity ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = \varepsilon_{\text{r}} - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

So in the case of a vacuum,

:&lt;math&gt;\chi =  0. &lt;/math&gt;

The susceptibility is also related to the [[polarizability]] of individual particles in the medium by the [[Clausius-Mossotti relation]].

The [[electric displacement]] '''D''' is related to the polarization density '''P''' by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} = \varepsilon_0 (1+\chi) \mathbf{E} = \varepsilon_{\text{r}} \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The permittivity ''ε'' and [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] ''µ'' of a medium together determine the [[phase velocity]] ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''/''n'' of [[electromagnetic radiation]] through that medium:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \mu = \frac{1}{v^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Dispersion and causality==

In general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field, and so the more general formulation as a function of time is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(t)=\varepsilon_0 \int_{-\infty}^t \chi(t-t') \mathbf{E}(t') \, dt'.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the polarization is a [[convolution]] of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by ''χ''(Δ''t''). The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines ''χ''(Δ''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for Δ''t''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0. An instantaneous response would correspond to a [[Dirac delta function]] susceptibility ''χ''(Δ''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''χ&amp;nbsp;δ''(Δ''t'').

It is convenient to take the [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] with respect to time and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Because of the [[convolution theorem]], the integral becomes a simple product,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(\omega)=\varepsilon_0 \chi(\omega) \mathbf{E}(\omega).&lt;/math&gt;

This frequency dependence of the susceptibility leads to frequency dependence of the permittivity. The shape of the susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties of the material.

Moreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e. effectively ''χ''(Δ''t'') = 0 for Δ''t'' &lt; 0), a consequence of [[causality]], imposes [[Kramers–Kronig relation|Kramers–Kronig constraints]] on the susceptibility ''χ''(0).

===Complex permittivity===

[[Image:Dielectric responses.svg|thumb|right|454px|A dielectric permittivity spectrum over a wide range of frequencies. ''ε''′ and ''ε''″ denote the real and the imaginary part of the permittivity, respectively. Various processes are labeled on the image: ionic and dipolar relaxation, and atomic and electronic resonances at higher energies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psrc.usm.edu/mauritz/dilect.html Dielectric Spectroscopy]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As opposed to the response of a vacuum, the response of normal materials to external fields generally depends on the [[frequency]] of the field. This frequency dependence reflects the fact that a material's polarization does not respond instantaneously to an applied field. The response must always be ''causal'' (arising after the applied field) which can be represented by a phase difference. For this reason, permittivity is often treated as a complex function of the [[Angular frequency|(angular) frequency]] of the applied field ''ω'': &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \rightarrow \widehat{\varepsilon}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; (since complex numbers allow specification of magnitude and phase). The definition of permittivity therefore becomes

:&lt;math&gt;D_0 e^{-i \omega t} = \widehat{\varepsilon}(\omega) E_0 e^{-i \omega t},&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are the amplitudes of the displacement and electric fields, respectively,
:''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]], ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1.

The response of a medium to static electric fields is described by the low-frequency limit of permittivity, also called the static permittivity ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (also ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;
):

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\text{s}} = \lim_{\omega \rightarrow 0} \widehat{\varepsilon}(\omega).&lt;/math&gt;

At the high-frequency limit, the complex permittivity is commonly referred to as ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. At the [[plasma frequency]] and above, dielectrics behave as ideal metals, with electron gas behavior. The static permittivity is a good approximation for alternating fields of low frequencies, and as the frequency increases a measurable phase difference ''δ'' emerges between '''D''' and '''E'''. The frequency at which the phase shift becomes noticeable depends on temperature and the details of the medium. For moderate fields strength (''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), '''D''' and '''E''' remain proportional, and

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\varepsilon} = \frac{D_0}{E_0} = |\varepsilon|e^{-i\delta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the response of materials to alternating fields is characterized by a complex permittivity, it is natural to separate its real and imaginary parts, which is done by convention in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\varepsilon}(\omega) = \varepsilon'(\omega) - i\varepsilon''(\omega) = \left | \frac{D_0}{E_0} \right | \left( \cos\delta - i\sin\delta \right). &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''ε''’ is the real part of the permittivity, which is related to the stored energy within the medium;
:''ε''” is the imaginary part of the permittivity, which is related to the dissipation (or loss) of energy within the medium;
:''δ'' is the [[loss angle]].

The choice of sign for time-dependence, exp(-''iωt''), dictates the sign convention for the imaginary part of permittivity. The signs used here correspond to those commonly used in physics, whereas for the engineering convention one should reverse all imaginary quantities.

The complex permittivity is usually a complicated function of frequency ''ω'', since it is a superimposed description of [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] phenomena occurring at multiple frequencies. The dielectric function ''ε''(''ω'') must have poles only for frequencies with positive imaginary parts, and therefore satisfies the [[Kramers–Kronig relation]]s. However, in the narrow frequency ranges that are often studied in practice, the permittivity can be approximated as frequency-independent or by model functions.

At a given frequency, the imaginary part of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; leads to absorption loss if it is positive (in the above sign convention) and gain if it is negative. More generally, the imaginary parts of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the anisotropic dielectric tensor should be considered.

In the case of solids, the complex dielectric function is intimately connected to band structure. The primary quantity that characterizes the electronic structure of any crystalline material is the probability of [[photon]] absorption, which is directly related to the imaginary part of the optical dielectric function ''ε''(''ω''). The optical dielectric function is given by the fundamental expression:&lt;ref name=Cardona&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; for an alloy it is somewhat closer to Gaussian because of strong scattering from statistical fluctuations in the local composition on a nanometer scale.

===Tensorial permittivity===

According to the [[Drude model]] of magnetized plasma, a more general expression which takes into account the interaction of the carriers with an alternating electric field at millimeter and microwave frequencies in an axially magnetized semiconductor requires the expression of the permittivity as a non-diagonal tensor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/vsp/jew/2003/00000017/00000008/art00011] Prati E.  (2003) &quot;Propagation in gyroelectromagnetic guiding systems&quot;, ''J. of Electr. Wav. and Appl.'' '''17, 8''', 1177&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Electro-gyration]]).

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{D}(\omega) &amp; = \begin{vmatrix}
\varepsilon_{1} &amp; -i \varepsilon_{2} &amp; 0\\
i \varepsilon_{2} &amp; \varepsilon_{1} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varepsilon_{z}\\
\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{E}(\omega)\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{2} &lt;/math&gt; vanishes, then the tensor is diagonal but not proportional to the identity and the medium  is said to be a uniaxial medium, which has similar properties to a [[uniaxial crystal]].

===Classification of materials===
{{Classification of materials based on permittivity}}
Materials can be classified according to their complex-valued permittivity ''ε'', upon comparison of its real ''ε''’ and imaginary ''ε''&quot; components (or, equivalently, [[Electric conductivity|conductivity]], ''σ'', when it's accounted for in the latter). A ''[[perfect conductor]]'' has infinite conductivity, ''σ''=&amp;infin;, while a ''[[perfect dielectric]]'' is a material that has no conductivity at all, ''σ''=0; this latter case, of real-valued permittivity (or complex-valued permittivity with zero imaginary component) is also associated with the name ''lossless media''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ch01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, when ''σ''/(''ωε''’) ≪ 1 we consider the material to be a ''low-loss dielectric'' (nearly though not exactly lossless), whereas ''σ''/(''ωε''’) ≫ 1 is associated with a ''good conductor''; such materials with non-negligible conductivity yield a large amount of [[dielectric loss|loss]] that inhibit the propagation of electromagnetic waves, thus are also said to be ''lossy media''. Those materials that do not fall under either limit are considered to be general media.

===Lossy medium===
In the case of a lossy medium, i.e. when the conduction current is not negligible, the total current density flowing is:

:&lt;math&gt; J_\text{tot} = J_{\text{c}} + J_{\text{d}} = \sigma E + i \omega \varepsilon' E = -i \omega \widehat{\varepsilon} E &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''σ'' is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of the medium;
:''ε''’ is the real part of the permittivity.
:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex permittivity

The size of the [[displacement current]] is dependent on the [[frequency]] ω of the applied field ''E''; there is no displacement current in a constant field.

In this formalism, the complex permittivity is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;John S. Seybold (2005) Introduction to RF propagation. 330 pp, eq.(2.6), p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \widehat{\varepsilon} = \varepsilon' - i \frac{\sigma}{\omega} &lt;/math&gt;

In general, the absorption of electromagnetic energy by dielectrics is covered by a few different mechanisms that influence the shape of the permittivity as a function of frequency:

*First, are the [[Dielectric#Dielectric relaxation|relaxation]] effects associated with permanent and induced [[Dipole|molecular dipoles]]. At low frequencies the field changes slowly enough to allow dipoles to reach [[Wiktionary:equilibrium|equilibrium]] before the field has measurably changed. For frequencies at which dipole orientations cannot follow the applied field because of the [[viscosity]] of the medium, absorption of the field's energy leads to energy dissipation. The mechanism of dipoles relaxing is called [[Dielectric#Dielectric relaxation|dielectric relaxation]] and for ideal dipoles is described by classic [[Debye relaxation]].

*Second are the [[resonance| resonance effects]], which arise from the rotations or vibrations of atoms, [[ion]]s, or [[electron]]s. These processes are observed in the neighborhood of their characteristic [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption frequencies]].

The above effects often combine to cause non-linear effects within capacitors. For example, dielectric absorption refers to the inability of a capacitor that has been charged for a long time to completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage, a phenomenon that is also called ''soakage'' or ''battery action''. For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1-2% of the original voltage. However, it can be as much as 15 - 25% in the case of [[electrolytic capacitor]]s or [[supercapacitor]]s.

===Quantum-mechanical interpretation===

In terms of [[quantum mechanics]], permittivity is explained by [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] interactions.

At low frequencies, molecules in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the [[microwave]] frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break [[hydrogen bond]]s. The field does work against the bonds and the energy is absorbed by the material as [[heat]]. This is why microwave ovens work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the absorptive index) of water, one at the microwave frequency, and the other at far ultraviolet (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of microwave ovens.

At moderate frequencies, the energy is too high to cause rotation, yet too low to affect electrons directly, and is absorbed in the form of resonant molecular vibrations. In water, this is where the absorptive index starts to drop sharply, and the minimum of the imaginary permittivity is at the frequency of blue light (optical regime).

At high frequencies (such as UV and above), molecules cannot relax, and the energy is purely absorbed by atoms, exciting [[electron]] energy levels. Thus, these frequencies are classified as [[ionizing radiation]].

While carrying out a complete ''[[ab initio]]'' (that is, first-principles) modelling is now computationally possible, it has not been widely applied yet. Thus, a phenomenological model is accepted as being an adequate method of capturing experimental behaviors. The [[Debye relaxation|Debye model]] and the [[Lorentz model]] use a 1st-order and 2nd-order (respectively) lumped system parameter linear representation (such as an RC and an LRC resonant circuit).

==Measurement==
{{main|dielectric spectroscopy}}

The dielectric constant of a material can be found by a variety of static electrical measurements. The complex permittivity is evaluated over a wide range of frequencies by using different variants of [[dielectric spectroscopy]], covering nearly 21 orders of magnitude from 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; [[Hertz|Hz]]. Also, by using [[cryostat]]s and ovens, the dielectric properties of a medium can be characterized over an array of temperatures. In order to study systems for such diverse excitation fields, a number of measurement setups are used, each adequate for a special frequency range.

Various microwave measurement techniques are outlined in Chen ''et al.''.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite book |title=Microwave electronics |author=Linfeng Chen, V. V. Varadan, C. K. Ong, Chye Poh Neo |chapter=Microwave theory and techniques for materials characterization |isbn=0-470-84492-2 |publisher=Wiley |year=2004 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2oA3po4coUoC&amp;pg=PA37|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical errors for the [[Hakki-Coleman method]] employing a puck of material between conducting planes are about 0.3%.&lt;ref name=Sebastian&gt;{{cite book |title=Dielectric Materials for Wireless Communication |page=19 |author=Mailadil T.

*Low-frequency [[time domain]] measurements (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Hz)
*Low-frequency [[frequency domain]] measurements (10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Hz)
*Reflective coaxial methods (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Hz)
*Transmission coaxial method (10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Hz)
*[[Quasi-optical]] methods (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Hz)
*[[Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]] (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Hz)
*Fourier-transform methods (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Hz)

At infrared and optical frequencies, a common technique is [[ellipsometry]]. [[Dual polarisation interferometry]] is also used to measure the complex refractive index for very thin films at optical frequencies.

A '''material's property''' is an [[intensive quantity|intensive]], often quantitative, [[Property (metaphysics)|property]] of some [[Chemical substance|material]]. Quantitative properties may be used as a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] by which the benefits of one material versus another can be assessed, thereby aiding in [[materials selection]].

A property may be a [[Physical constant|constant]] or may be a function of one or more [[independent variables]], such as temperature. Materials properties often vary to some degree according to the direction in the material in which they are measured, a condition referred to as [[anisotropy]]. Materials properties that relate to different physical phenomena often behave [[linearly]] (or approximately so) in a given [[operating range]]. Modeling them as linear can significantly simplify the [[differential equations|differential]] [[constitutive equation]]s that the property describes. 

Some materials properties are used in relevant equations to predict the attributes of a system [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]. For example, if a material of a known [[specific heat]] gains or loses a known amount of heat, the temperature change of that material can be determined. Materials properties are most reliably measured by standardized [[test method]]s. Many such test methods have been documented by their respective user communities and published through [[ASTM International]].

[[File:Hypervelocity Impact Demonstration.jpg|thumb|The &quot;energy flash&quot; of a hypervelocity impact during a laboratory simulation of what happens when a piece of [[orbital debris]] hits a spacecraft in orbit]]
'''Hypervelocity''' is very high [[velocity]], approximately over 3,000 [[metre per second|meters per second]] (6,700&amp;nbsp;mph, 11,000&amp;nbsp;km/h, 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s, or [[Mach number|Mach]] 8.8). In particular, hypervelocity is velocity so high that the strength of materials upon impact is very small compared to [[inertia]]l stresses.&lt;ref Name=&quot;AIAA&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Extreme hypervelocity results in [[vaporize|vaporization]] of the [[impact force|impactor]] and target. For structural metals, hypervelocity is generally considered to be over 2,500&amp;nbsp;m/s (5,600&amp;nbsp;mph, 9,000&amp;nbsp;km/h, 8,200&amp;nbsp;ft/s, or Mach 7.3).  [[Meteorite]] [[impact crater|crater]]s are also examples of hypervelocity impacts.

''Hypervelocity'' refers to velocities in the range from a few kilometers per [[second]] to some tens of kilometers per second. This is especially relevant in the field of [[space exploration]] and military use of space, where hypervelocity impacts (e.g. by [[space debris]] or an attacking [[projectile]]) can result in anything from minor component degradation to the complete destruction of a [[spacecraft]] or missile. The impactor, as well as the surface it hits, can undergo temporary [[liquefaction]]. The impact process can generate [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] discharges, which can interfere with spacecraft electronics.

Hypervelocity usually occurs during [[meteor shower]]s and deep space reentries, as carried out during the [[Zond program|Zond]], [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Luna programme|Luna]] programs. Given the intrinsic unpredictability of the timing and trajectories of meteors, space capsules are prime data gathering opportunities for the study of thermal protection materials at hypervelocity (in this context, hypervelocity is defined as greater than [[escape velocity]]). Given the rarity of such observation opportunities since the 1970s, the [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]] and [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] Sample Return Capsule (SRC) reentries as well as the recent [[Hayabusa]] SRC reentry have spawned observation campaigns, most notably at [[NASA Ames Research Center]].

Hypervelocity [[collision]]s can be studied by examining the results of naturally-occurring collisions (between [[micrometeoroid|micrometeorites]] and spacecraft, or between meteorites and planetary bodies), or they may be performed in laboratories. Currently the primary tool for laboratory experiments is a [[light-gas gun]], but some experiments have used [[linear motor]]s to accelerate projectiles to hypervelocity. The properties of metals under hypervelocity have been integrated with weapons, such as [[explosively formed penetrator]]. The vaporization upon impact and liquefaction of surfaces allow metal projectiles formed under hypervelocity forces to penetrate vehicle armor better than conventional bullets.

[[NASA]] studies the effects of simulated orbital debris at the [[White Sands Test Facility]] Remote Hypervelocity Test Laboratory (RHTL).&lt;ref Name=&quot;RHTL&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|title= Remote Hypervelocity Test Laboratory
|url= http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/laboratories/hypervelocity/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects smaller than a softball cannot be detected on radar. This has prompted spacecraft designers to develop shields to protect spacecraft from unavoidable collisions. At RHTL, [[micrometeoroid]] and [[orbital debris]] (MMOD) impacts are simulated on spacecraft components and shields allowing designers to test threats posed by the growing orbital debris environment and evolve shield technology to stay one step ahead. At RHTL, four two-stage light-gas guns propel 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm to 22.2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter projectiles to velocities as fast as 8.5&amp;nbsp;km/s.

==Other definitions of hypervelocity==
According to the [[United States Army]], ''hypervelocity'' can also refer to the [[muzzle velocity]] of a weapon system, with the exact definition dependent upon the weapon in question.  When discussing [[small arms]] a muzzle velocity of 5,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1524&amp;nbsp;m/s) or greater is considered hypervelocity, while for [[tank]] [[cannons]] the muzzle velocity must meet or exceed 3,350&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1021.08&amp;nbsp;m/s) to be considered hypervelocity and the threshold for [[artillery]] cannons is 3,500&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1066.8&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref Name=&quot;DA&quot;&gt;{{cite web

An '''electrochemical gradient''' is a [[gradient]] of [[electrochemical potential]], usually for an [[ion]] that can move across a [[membrane]]. The gradient consists of two parts, the [[electrical potential]] and a difference in the chemical [[concentration]] across a membrane. The difference of [[electrochemical potential]]s can be interpreted as a type of [[potential energy]] available for work in a cell. The energy is stored in the form of [[chemical potential]], which accounts for an ion's ''concentration gradient'' across a [[cell membrane]], and [[electrostatic energy]], which accounts for an ion's tendency to move under influence of the [[transmembrane potential]].

==Overview==
Electrochemical potential is important in [[electroanalytical chemistry]] and industrial applications such as batteries and fuel cells. It represents one of the many interchangeable forms of [[potential energy]] through which energy may be [[conservation of energy|conserved]].

In biological processes, the direction an ion moves by [[diffusion]] or [[active transport]] across a membrane is determined by the electrochemical gradient. In [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, proton gradients are used to generate a '''chemiosmotic potential''' that is also known as a '''proton motive force'''. This potential energy is used for the synthesis of ATP by [[oxidative phosphorylation]].

An electrochemical gradient has two components.  First, the electrical component is caused by a charge difference across the lipid membrane. Second, a chemical component is caused by a differential concentration of [[ions]] across the membrane. The combination of these two factors determines the thermodynamically favourable direction for an ion's movement across a membrane.

An electrochemical gradient is analogous to the water [[pressure]] across a [[hydroelectric dam]]. [[Membrane transport protein]]s such as the [[sodium-potassium pump]] within the membrane are equivalent to turbines that convert the water's potential energy to other forms of physical or chemical energy, and the ions that pass through the membrane are equivalent to water that ends up at the bottom of the dam.  Also, energy can be used to pump water up into the lake above the dam.  In similar manner, chemical energy in cells can be used to create electrochemical gradients.

==Chemistry==
The term is typically applied in contexts wherein a [[chemical reaction]] is to take place, such as one involving the transfer of an electron at a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] electrode. In a battery, an electrochemical potential arising from the movement of ions balances the reaction energy of the electrodes. The maximum voltage that a battery reaction can produce is sometimes called the '''standard electrochemical potential''' of that reaction (see also [[Electrode potential]] and [[Table of standard electrode potentials]]). In instances pertaining specifically to the movement of electrically charged solutes, the potential is often expressed in units of [[volt]]s. See: [[Concentration cell]].

==Biological context==
In biology, the term is sometimes used in the context of a chemical reaction, in particular to describe the energy source for the chemical synthesis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. In more general terms, however, it is used to characterize the tendency of solutes to simply diffuse across a [[cell membrane|membrane]], a process involving no chemical transformation.

==Ion gradients==
With respect to a [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[organelle]], or other subcellular compartment, the tendency of an electrically charged solute, such as a potassium [[ion]], to move across the membrane is decided by the difference in its electrochemical potential on either side of the membrane, which arises from three factors:
* the difference in the [[concentration]] of the solute between the two sides of the membrane
* the charge or &quot;valence&quot; of the solute molecule
* the difference in voltage between the two sides of the membrane (i.e. the [[transmembrane potential]]).

A solute's electrochemical potential difference is zero at its &quot;[[reversal potential]]&quot;, the transmembrane voltage at which the solute's net flow across the membrane is also zero. This potential is predicted, in theory, either by the [[Nernst equation]] (for systems of one permeant ion species) or by the [[Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation]] (for more than one permeant ion species).  Electrochemical potential is measured in the laboratory and field using [[reference electrode]]s.

Transmembrane ATPases or transmembrane proteins with ATPase domains are often used for making and utilizing ion gradients. The enzyme [[NaKATPase|Na+/K+ ATPase]] uses ATP to make a sodium ion gradient and a potassium ion gradient. The electrochemical potential is used as energy storage.  Chemiosmotic coupling is one of several ways a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction can be driven by a thermodynamically favorable one. [[Co-transport|Cotransport]] of ions by [[symporter]]s and [[antiporter]] carriers is commonly used to actively move ions across biological membranes.

==Proton gradients==
The '''proton gradient''' can be used as intermediate energy storage for heat production and [[flagellum|flagellar]] [[rotation]]. In addition, it is an interconvertible form of energy in active transport, electron potential generation, [[NADPH]] synthesis, and [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] synthesis/hydrolysis.

The electrochemical potential difference between the two sides of the membrane in [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplast]]s, [[bacterium|bacteria]], and other membranous compartments that engage in [[active transport]] involving [[proton pump]]s, is at times called a chemiosmotic potential or proton motive force (see [[chemiosmosis]]). In this context, [[proton]]s are often considered separately using units of either concentration or [[pH]].

===Proton motive force&lt;!--Proton electromotive force links here--&gt;===
Two protons are expelled at each coupling site, generating the proton motive force (PMF). ATP is made indirectly using the PMF as a source of energy.

Some [[archaea]], the most notable ones being [[halobacteria]], make proton gradients by pumping in protons from the environment with the help of the solar-driven enzyme [[bacteriorhodopsin]], which is used here for driving the molecular motor enzyme [[ATP synthase]] to make the necessary conformational changes required to synthesize ATP.

Proton gradients are also made by bacteria by running ATP synthase in reverse, and are used to drive flagella.

The F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; ATP synthase is a reversible enzyme. Large enough quantities of ATP cause it to create a transmembrane [[proton]] [[gradient]]. This is used by fermenting bacteria - which do not have an electron transport chain, and hydrolyze ATP to make a proton gradient - for [[flagella]] and the transportation of nutrients into the cell.

In respiring bacteria under physiological conditions, ATP synthase, in general, runs in the opposite direction, creating ATP while using the proton motive force created by the [[electron transfer chain|electron transport chain]] as a source of energy. The overall process of creating energy in this fashion is termed [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The same process takes place in [[mitochondria]], where ATP synthase is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, so that F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; part sticks into the mitochondrial matrix where ATP synthesis takes place.

[[File:Dehnungsfuge.jpg|thumb|[[Expansion joint]] in a [[road bridge]] used to avoid damage from thermal expansion.]]

'''Thermal expansion''' is the tendency of matter to change in [[shape]], [[area]], and [[volume]] in response to a change in [[temperature]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Tipler&quot;&gt; when the body is heated its dimension(size) increase.This increase in dimension is called thermal expansion .

Temperature is a monotonic function of the average molecular kinetic energy of a substance. When a substance is heated, the kinetic energy of its molecules increases. Thus, the molecules begin moving more and usually maintain a greater average separation. Materials which contract with increasing temperature are unusual; this effect is limited in size, and only occurs within limited temperature ranges (see examples below). The degree of expansion divided by the change in temperature is called the material's '''coefficient of thermal expansion''' and generally varies with temperature.

==Overview==

===Predicting expansion===
If an [[equation of state]] is available, it can be used to predict the values of the thermal expansion at all the required temperatures and [[pressure]]s, along with many other [[state function]]s.

===Contraction effects (negative thermal expansion) ===
A number of materials contract on heating within certain temperature ranges; this is usually called [[negative thermal expansion]], rather than &quot;thermal contraction&quot;. For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion of water drops to zero as it is cooled to 3.983&amp;nbsp;°C and then becomes negative below this temperature; this means that water has a maximum [[density]] at this temperature, and this leads to bodies of water maintaining this temperature at their lower depths during extended periods of sub-zero weather. Also, fairly pure silicon has a negative coefficient of thermal expansion for temperatures between about 18 and 120 [[Kelvin]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Factors affecting thermal expansion===
Unlike gases or liquids, solid materials tend to keep their shape when undergoing thermal expansion.

Thermal expansion generally decreases with increasing [[Molecular bond|bond]] energy, which also has an effect on the [[melting point]] of solids, so, high melting point materials are more likely to have lower thermal expansion. In general, liquids expand slightly more than solids. The thermal expansion of glasses is higher compared to that of crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=A. K.| last=Varshneya|title=Fundamentals of inorganic glasses|publisher=Society of Glass Technology|location= Sheffield|year=2006|isbn=0-12-714970-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the glass transition temperature, rearrangements that occur in an amorphous material lead to characteristic discontinuities of coefficient of thermal expansion or specific heat. These discontinuities allow detection of the glass transition temperature where a supercooled liquid transforms to a glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/e10030334|first=M. I.|last= Ojovan|title= Configurons: thermodynamic parameters and symmetry changes at glass transition|journal=Entropy|volume=10|issue=3|pages=334–364 |year=2008|bibcode = 2008Entrp..10..334O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sorption|Absorption]] or desorption of water (or other solvents) can change the size of many common materials; many organic materials change size much more due to this effect than they do to thermal expansion. Common plastics exposed to water can, in the long term, expand by many percent.

==Coefficient of thermal expansion==
The '''coefficient of thermal expansion''' describes how the size of an object changes with a change in temperature. Specifically, it measures the fractional change in size per degree change in temperature at a constant pressure. Several types of coefficients have been developed: volumetric, area, and linear. Which is used depends on the particular application and which dimensions are considered important. For solids, one might only be concerned with the change along a length, or over some area.

The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient is the most basic thermal expansion coefficient, and the most relevant for fluids. In general, substances expand or contract when their temperature changes, with expansion or contraction occurring in all directions. Substances that expand at the same rate in every direction are called [[isotropy|isotropic]]. For isotropic materials, the area and volumetric thermal expansion coefficient are, respectively, approximately twice and three times larger than the linear thermal expansion coefficient.

Mathematical definitions of these coefficients are defined below for solids, liquids, and gases.

===General volumetric thermal expansion coefficient===
In the general case of a gas, liquid, or solid, the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_V = \frac{1}{V}\,\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_p
&lt;/math&gt;

The subscript ''p'' indicates that the pressure is held constant during the expansion, and the subscript ''V'' stresses that it is the volumetric (not linear) expansion that enters this general definition. In the case of a gas, the fact that the pressure is held constant is important, because the volume of a gas will vary appreciably with pressure as well as temperature. For a gas of low density this can be seen from the [[ideal gas]] law.

==Expansion in solids==

When calculating thermal expansion it is necessary to consider whether the body is free to expand or is constrained. If the body is free to expand, the expansion or strain resulting from an increase in temperature can be simply calculated by using the applicable coefficient of thermal expansion.

If the body is constrained so that it cannot expand, then internal stress will be caused (or changed) by a change in temperature. This stress can be calculated by considering the strain that would occur if the body were free to expand and the stress required to reduce that strain to zero, through the stress/strain relationship chracterised by the elastic or [[Young's modulus]]. In the special case of [[solid]] materials, external ambient pressure does not usually appreciably affect the size of an object and so it is not usually necessary to consider the effect of pressure changes.

Common engineering solids usually have coefficients of thermal expansion that do not vary significantly over the range of temperatures where they are designed to be used, so where extremely high accuracy is not required, practical calculations can be based on a constant, average, value of the coefficient of expansion.

===Linear expansion===

[[File:Linia dilato.png|thumb|Change in length of a rod due to thermal expansion.]]

Linear expansion means change in one dimension (length) as opposed to change in volume (volumetric expansion).
To a first approximation, the change in length measurements of an object due to thermal expansion is related to temperature change by a &quot;linear expansion coefficient&quot;. It is the fractional change in length per degree of temperature change. Assuming negligible effect of pressure, we may write:

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_L=\frac{1}{L}\,\frac{dL}{dT}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a particular length measurement and &lt;math&gt;dL/dT&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of that linear dimension per unit change in temperature.

The change in the linear dimension can be estimated to be:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Delta L}{L} = \alpha_L\Delta T
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation works well as long as the linear-expansion coefficient does not change much over the change in temperature &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;, and the fractional change in length is small &lt;math&gt;\Delta L/L \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;. If either of these conditions does not hold, the equation must be integrated.

====Effects on strain====
For solid materials with a significant length, like rods or cables, an estimate of the amount of thermal expansion can be described by the material [[Strain (materials science)|strain]], given by &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\mathrm{thermal}&lt;/math&gt; and defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\mathrm{thermal} = \frac{(L_\mathrm{final} - L_\mathrm{initial})} {L_\mathrm{initial}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L_\mathrm{initial}&lt;/math&gt; is the length before the change of temperature and &lt;math&gt;L_\mathrm{final}&lt;/math&gt; is the length after the change of temperature.

For most solids, thermal expansion is proportional to the change in temperature:
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\mathrm{thermal} \propto \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the change in either the [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] or temperature can be estimated by:
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\mathrm{thermal} = \alpha_L \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = (T_\mathrm{final} - T_\mathrm{initial})&lt;/math&gt;
is the difference of the temperature between the two recorded strains, measured in [[degrees Celsius]] or [[Kelvin]],
and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_L &lt;/math&gt; is the linear coefficient of thermal expansion in &quot;per degree Celsius&quot; or &quot;per Kelvin&quot;, denoted by °C&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. In the field of continuum mechanics, the thermal expansion and its effects are treated as [[eigenstrain]] and eigenstress.

===Area expansion===
The area thermal expansion coefficient relates the change in a material's area dimensions to a change in temperature. It is the fractional change in area per degree of temperature change. Ignoring pressure, we may write:

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_A=\frac{1}{A}\,\frac{dA}{dT}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is some area of interest on the object, and &lt;math&gt;dA/dT&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of that area per unit change in temperature.

The change in the area can be estimated as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Delta A}{A} = \alpha_A\Delta T
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation works well as long as the area expansion coefficient does not change much over the change in temperature &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;, and the fractional change in area is small &lt;math&gt;\Delta A/A \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;. If either of these conditions does not hold, the equation must be integrated.

===Volume expansion===
For a solid, we can ignore the effects of pressure on the material, and the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be written:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Donald L. | last = Turcotte |author2=Schubert, Gerald  | year = 2002 | title = Geodynamics | edition = 2nd | publisher = Cambridge | isbn = 0-521-66624-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_V = \frac{1}{V}\,\frac{dV}{dT}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the material, and &lt;math&gt;dV/dT&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of that volume with temperature.

This means that the volume of a material changes by some fixed fractional amount. For example, a steel block with a volume of 1 cubic meter might expand to 1.002 cubic meters when the temperature is raised by 50&amp;nbsp;K. This is an expansion of 0.2%. If we had a block of steel with a volume of 2 cubic meters, then under the same conditions, it would expand to 2.004 cubic meters, again an expansion of 0.2%. The volumetric expansion coefficient would be 0.2% for 50&amp;nbsp;K, or 0.004% K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

If we already know the expansion coefficient, then we can calculate the change in volume

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \alpha_V\Delta T
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta V/V&lt;/math&gt; is the fractional change in volume (e.g., 0.002) and &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the change in temperature (50&amp;nbsp;°C).

The above example assumes that the expansion coefficient did not change as the temperature changed and the increase in volume is small compared to the original volume. This is not always true, but for small changes in temperature, it is a good approximation. If the volumetric expansion coefficient does change appreciably with temperature, or the increase in volume is significant, then the above equation will have to be integrated:

:&lt;math&gt;
\ln\left(\frac{V + \Delta V}{V}\right) = \int_{T_i}^{T_f}\alpha_V(T)\,dT
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \exp\left(\int_{T_i}^{T_f}\alpha_V(T)\,dT\right) - 1
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_V(T)&lt;/math&gt; is the volumetric expansion coefficient as a function of temperature ''T'', and &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;T_f&lt;/math&gt; are the initial and final temperatures respectively.

====Isotropic materials====
For isotropic materials the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient is three times the linear coefficient:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_V = 3\alpha_L&lt;/math&gt;

This ratio arises because volume is composed of three mutually [[orthogonal]] directions. Thus, in an isotropic material, for small differential changes, one-third of the volumetric expansion is in a single axis. As an example, take a cube of steel that has sides of length ''L''. The original volume will be &lt;math&gt;V=L^3&lt;/math&gt; and the new volume, after a temperature increase, will be

:&lt;math&gt;V+\Delta V=(L+\Delta L)^3 = L^3 + 3L^2\Delta L + 3L\Delta L^2 + \Delta L^3 \approx L^3 + 3L^2\Delta L = V + 3 V {\Delta L \over L}&lt;/math&gt;

We can make the substitutions &lt;math&gt;\Delta V=\alpha_V L^3\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; and, for isotropic materials, &lt;math&gt;\Delta L=\alpha_L L \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;. We now have:

:&lt;math&gt;V + \Delta V =( L+L\alpha_V\Delta T)^3=L^3 + 3L^3 \alpha_L \Delta T + 3L^3\alpha_L^2 \Delta T^2 + L^3\alpha_L^3 \Delta T^3 \approx L^3 + 3L^3 \alpha_L \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;

Since the volumetric and linear coefficients are defined only for extremely small temperature and dimensional changes (that is, when &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta L&lt;/math&gt; are small), the last two terms can be ignored and we get the above relationship between the two coefficients. If we are trying to go back and forth between volumetric and linear coefficients using larger values of &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; then we will need to take into account the third term, and sometimes even the fourth term.

Similarly, the area thermal expansion coefficient is two times the linear coefficient:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_A = 2\alpha_L&lt;/math&gt;

This ratio can be found in a way similar to that in the linear example above, noting that the area of a face on the cube is just &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;. Also, the same considerations must be made when dealing with large values of &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;.

===Anisotropic materials===
Materials with [[anisotropic]] structures, such as [[crystals]] (with less than cubic symmetry) and many [[Composite material|composites]], will generally have different linear expansion coefficients &lt;math&gt;\frac{}{}\alpha_L &lt;/math&gt; in different directions. As a result, the total volumetric expansion is distributed unequally among the three axes. If the crystal symmetry is monoclinic or triclinic, even the angles between these axes are subject to thermal changes. In such cases it is necessary to treat the coefficient of thermal expansion as a [[tensor]] with up to six independent elements. A good way to determine the elements of the tensor is to study the expansion by [[Powder diffraction#Expansion tensors, bulk modulus|powder diffraction]].

==Isobaric expansion in gases==
For an [[ideal gas]], the volumetric thermal expansion (i.e., relative change in volume due to temperature change) depends on the type of process in which temperature is changed. Two simple cases are [[Isobaric process|isobaric]] change, where [[pressure]] is held constant, and [[adiabatic]] change, where no [[heat]] is exchanged with the environment.

The [[ideal gas law]] can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;pv = T \,&lt;/math&gt;

where p is the pressure, v is the specific volume, and t is temperature measured in ''energy units''. By taking the logarithm of this equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\ln\left(v\right) +  \ln\left(p\right) = \ln \left(T\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Then by definition of isobaric thermal expansion coefficient, with the above equation of state:

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma_p \equiv \frac{1}{v} \left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial T}\right)_p = \left(\frac{d(\ln v)}{d T}\right)_p = \frac{d(\ln T)}{d T} = \frac{1}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

The index &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; denotes an isobaric process.

==Expansion in liquids==
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}

Theoretically, the coefficient of linear expansion can be found from the coefficient of volumetric expansion (''α&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;3''α''). However, for liquids, ''α'' is calculated through the experimental determination of ''α&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Expansion in mixtures and alloys==
The expansivity of the components of the mixture can cancel each other like in [[invar]].

The thermal expansivity of a mixture from the expansivities of the pure components and their [[excess molar quantity|excess]] expansivities follow from:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial V}{\partial T} = \sum_i \frac{\partial V_i}{\partial T} + \sum_i \frac{\partial V_i^{E}}{\partial T}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha= \sum_i \alpha_i V_i + \sum_i \alpha_i^{E} V_i^{E}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \bar{V^E}_i}{\partial T} = R \frac{\partial (ln(\gamma_i))}{\partial P} +RT {\partial^2\over\partial T\partial P} ln(\gamma_i)&lt;/math&gt;

==Apparent and absolute expansion==
When measuring the expansion of a liquid, the measurement must account for the expansion of the container as well. For example, a flask that has been constructed with a long narrow stem filled with enough liquid that the stem itself is partially filled, when placed in a heat bath will initially show the column of liquid in the stem to drop followed by the immediate increase of that column until the flask-liquid-heat bath system has thermalized. The initial observation of the column of liquid dropping is not due to an initial contraction of the liquid but rather the expansion of the flask as it contacts the heat bath first. Soon after, the liquid in the flask is heated by the flask itself and begins to expand. Since liquids typically have a greater expansion over solids, the liquid in the flask eventually exceeds that of the flask, causing the column of liquid in the flask to rise. A direct measurement of the height of the liquid column is a measurement of the apparent expansion of the liquid. The [[absolute scale|absolute]] expansion of the liquid is the apparent expansion corrected for the expansion of the containing vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Ganot, A., Atkinson, E. (1883). ''Elementary treatise on physics experimental and applied for the use of colleges and schools'', William and Wood &amp; Co, New York, pp. 272–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and applications==
{{For|applications using the thermal expansion property|bi-metal|mercury-in-glass thermometer}}
[[File:Rail buckle.jpg|thumb|350px|Thermal expansion of long continuous sections of rail tracks is the driving force for [[Rail stressing|rail buckling]]. This phenomenon resulted in 190 train derailments during 1998–2002 in the US alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volpe.dot.gov/infrastructure-systems-engineering/structures-and-dynamics/track-buckling-research Track Buckling Research]. Volpe Center, U.S. Department of Transportation&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The expansion and contraction of materials must be considered when designing large structures, when using tape or chain to measure distances for land surveys, when designing molds for casting hot material, and in other engineering applications when large changes in dimension due to temperature are expected.

Thermal expansion is also used in mechanical applications to fit parts over one another, e.g. a bushing can be fitted over a shaft by making its inner diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the shaft, then heating it until it fits over the shaft, and allowing it to cool after it has been pushed over the shaft, thus achieving a 'shrink fit'. [[Induction shrink fitting]] is a common industrial method to pre-heat metal components between 150&amp;nbsp;°C and 300&amp;nbsp;°C thereby causing them to expand and allow for the insertion or removal of another component.

There exist some alloys with a very small linear expansion coefficient, used in applications that demand very small changes in physical dimension over a range of temperatures. One of these is [[Invar]] 36, with ''α'' approximately equal to 0.6{{e|-6}} K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;!-- This value does not match with the one in the table above (1.2{{e|-6}} K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) --&gt; These alloys are useful in aerospace applications where wide temperature swings may occur.

[[Pullinger's apparatus]] is used to determine the linear expansion of a metallic rod in the laboratory. The apparatus consists of a metal cylinder closed at both ends (called a steam jacket). It is provided with an inlet and outlet for the steam. The steam for heating the rod is supplied by a boiler which is connected by a rubber tube to the inlet. The center of the cylinder contains a hole to insert a thermometer. The rod under investigation is enclosed in a steam jacket. One of its ends is free, but the other end is pressed against a fixed screw. The position of the rod is determined by a [[micrometer|micrometer screw gauge]] or [[spherometer]].

[[File:Drikkeglas med brud-1.JPG|thumb|Drinking glass with fracture due to uneven thermal expansion after pouring of hot liquid into the otherwise cool glass]]

The control of thermal expansion in brittle materials is a key concern for a wide range of reasons. For example, both glass and [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] are brittle and uneven temperature causes uneven expansion which again causes thermal stress and this might lead to fracture. Ceramics need to be joined or work in consort with a wide range of materials and therefore their expansion must be matched to the application. Because glazes need to be firmly attached to the underlying porcelain (or other body type) their thermal expansion must be tuned to 'fit' the body so that [[crazing]] or shivering do not occur. Good example of products whose thermal expansion is the key to their success are [[CorningWare]] and the [[spark plug]]. The thermal expansion of ceramic bodies can be controlled by firing to create crystalline species that will influence the overall expansion of the material in the desired direction. In addition or instead the formulation of the body can employ materials delivering particles of the desired expansion to the matrix. The thermal expansion of glazes is controlled by their chemical composition and the firing schedule to which they were subjected. In most cases there are complex issues involved in controlling body and glaze expansion, adjusting for thermal expansion must be done with an eye to other properties that will be affected, generally trade-offs are required.

Thermal expansion can have a noticeable effect in gasoline stored in above ground storage tanks which can cause gasoline pumps to dispense gasoline which may be more compressed than gasoline held in underground storage tanks in the winter time or less compressed than gasoline held in underground storage tanks in the summer time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artofbeingcheap.com/above-ground-tanks/ Cost or savings of thermal expansion in above ground tanks]. Artofbeingcheap.com (2013-09-06). Retrieved 2014-01-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Heat-induced expansion has to be taken into account in most areas of engineering. A few examples are:
*Metal framed windows need rubber spacers
*Rubber tires
*Metal hot water heating pipes should not be used in long straight lengths
*Large structures such as railways and bridges need [[expansion joint]]s in the structures to avoid [[sun kink]]
*One of the reasons for the poor performance of cold car engines is that parts have inefficiently large spacings until the normal [[operating temperature]] is achieved.
*A [[gridiron pendulum]] uses an arrangement of different metals to maintain a more temperature stable pendulum length.
*A power line on a hot day is droopy, but on a cold day it is tight. This is because the metals expand under heat.
*[[Expansion joints]] that absorb the thermal expansion in a piping system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/expansion-joint-catalog/lateral-angular-combined.htm  Lateral, Angular and Combined Movements] U.S. Bellows.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Precision engineering nearly always requires the engineer to pay attention to the thermal expansion of the product. For example when using a [[scanning electron microscope]] even small changes in temperature such as 1 degree can cause a sample to change its position relative to the focus point.

[[Thermometer]]s are another application of thermal expansion – most contain a liquid (usually mercury or alcohol) which is constrained to flow in only one direction (along the tube) due to changes in volume brought about by changes in temperature. A bi-metal mechanical thermometer uses a [[bimetallic strip]] and bends due to the differing thermal expansion of the two metals.

Metal pipes made of different materials are heated by passing steam through them. While each pipe is being tested, one end is securely fixed and the other rests on a rotating shaft, the motion of which is indicated with a pointer. The linear expansion of the different metals is compared qualitatively and the coefficient of linear thermal expansion is calculated.

==Thermal expansion coefficients for various materials==
{{main|Thermal expansion coefficients of the elements (data page)}}

[[File:Coefficient dilatation volumique isobare PP semicristallin Tait.svg|thumb|Volumetric thermal expansion coefficient for a semicrystalline polypropylene.]]

[[File:Coefficient dilatation lineique aciers.svg|thumb|Linear thermal expansion coefficient for some steel grades.]]

This section summarizes the coefficients for some common materials.

For isotropic materials the coefficients linear thermal expansion ''α'' and volumetric thermal expansion ''α&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' are related by ''α&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3''α''.
For liquids usually the coefficient of volumetric expansion is listed and linear expansion is calculated here for comparison.

For common materials like many metals and compounds, the thermal expansion coefficient is inversely proportional to the [[melting point]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-60-symmetry-structure-and-tensor-properties-of-materials-fall-2005/video-lectures/sheer-and-thermal-expansion-tensors-part-1/ MIT Lecture ''Sheer and Thermal Expansion Tensors – Part 1'']&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for metals the relation is:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \alpha \approx \frac{0.020}{M_P}
 &lt;/math&gt;
for [[halide]]s and [[oxide]]s
:&lt;math&gt;
 \alpha \approx \frac{0.038}{M_P} - 7.0 \cdot 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}
 &lt;/math&gt;

In the table below, the range for ''α'' is from 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for hard solids to 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for organic liquids. The coefficient ''α'' varies with the temperature and some materials have a very high variation ; see for example the variation vs. temperature of the volumetric coefficient for a semicrystalline polypropylene (PP) at different pressure, and the variation of the linear coefficient vs. temperature for some steel grades (from bottom to top: ferritic stainless steel, martensitic stainless steel, carbon steel, duplex stainless steel, austenitic steel).

(The formula ''α&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;3''α'' is usually used for solids.)&lt;ref name=&quot;thermex1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~vawter/PhysicsNet/Topics/Thermal/ThermExpan.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090417003154/http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~vawter/PhysicsNet/Topics/Thermal/ThermExpan.html |archivedate=2009-04-17 |title=Thermal Expansion|publisher=Western Washington University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Specific impulse''' (usually abbreviated ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;) is a measure of the efficiency of [[rocket engine|rocket]] and [[jet engine|jet]] engines. By definition, it is the [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] delivered per unit of [[propellant]] consumed, and is [[dimensional analysis|dimensionally equivalent]] to the [[thrust]] generated per unit propellant [[flow rate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;QRG1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/propulsion/3-what-is-specific-impulse.html|title=What is specific impulse?|publisher=Qualitative Reasoning Group|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; If [[mass]] (kilogram or [[slug (mass)|slug]]) is used as the unit of propellant, then specific impulse has units of [[velocity]]. If weight ([[newton (unit)|newton]] or [[pound (mass)|pound]]) is used instead, then specific impulse has units of time (seconds). The conversion constant between these two versions is the standard gravitational acceleration constant ([[standard gravity|''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;SINasa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/specimp.html|title=Specific impulse|last=Benson|first=Tom|date=11 July 2008|publisher=NASA|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher the specific impulse, the lower the propellant [[flow rate]] required for a given [[thrust]], and in the case of a rocket, the less propellant needed for a given [[delta-v]], per the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]].

Specific impulse is a useful value to compare engines, much like ''miles per gallon'' or ''liters per 100 kilometers'' is used for cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;sutton&quot; /&gt; A propulsion method and system with a higher specific impulse is more propellant-efficient.&lt;ref name=&quot;QRG1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ars20130414&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutchinson|first=Lee |title=New F-1B rocket engine upgrades Apollo-era design with 1.8M lbs of thrust |url=http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/new-f-1b-rocket-engine-upgrades-apollo-era-deisgn-with-1-8m-lbs-of-thrust/ |accessdate=15 April 2013 |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |date=14 April 2013 |quote=The measure of a rocket's fuel efficiency is called its specific impulse (abbreviated as 'ISP'—or more properly Isp).... 'Mass specific impulse...describes the thrust-producing efficiency of a chemical reaction and it is most easily thought of as the amount of thrust force produced by each pound (mass) of fuel and oxidizer propellant burned in a unit of time. It is kind of like a measure of miles per gallon (mpg) for rockets.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the unit of seconds can seem confusing to laypeople, it is fairly simple to understand as &quot;hover-time&quot;: how long a rocket can &quot;hover&quot; before running out of fuel, given the weight of that propellant/fuel. Of course, the weight of the rocket has to be taken out of consideration and so does the reduction in fuel weight as it's expended; the basic idea is &quot;how ''long ''can any given amount of ''x'' hold itself up&quot;. Obviously that must mean &quot;...against Earth's gravity&quot;, which means nothing in non-Earth conditions; hence ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; being given in ''velocity'' when propellant is measured in mass rather than weight, and the question becomes &quot;how ''fast'' can any given amount of ''x'' accelerate itself?&quot;

Note that ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; describes efficiency in terms of ''amount of propellant'', and does not include the engine, structure or power source. Higher ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; means less ''propellant'' needed to impart a given momentum. Some systems with ''very ''high ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; (cf. ion thrusters) may have relatively very heavy/massive power generators, and produce thrust over a long period; thus, while they are &quot;efficient&quot; in terms of propellant mass carried, they may actually be quite poor at delivering high thrust as compared to &quot;less efficient&quot; engine/propellant designs.

Another number that measures the same thing, usually used for air breathing jet engines, is [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]]. Specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to specific impulse and the effective exhaust velocity.  The '''actual exhaust velocity''' is the average speed of the exhaust jet, which includes fuel combustion products, nitrogen, and argon, as it leaves an air breathing engine. The '''effective exhaust velocity''' is the exhaust velocity that the combusted fuel and atmospheric oxygen only would need to produce the same thrust. The two are identical for an ideal rocket working in vacuum, but are radically different for an [[air-breathing jet engine]] that obtains extra thrust by accelerating the non-combustible components of the air. Specific impulse and effective exhaust velocity are proportional.

==General considerations==
The amount of propellant is normally measured either in units of mass or weight. If mass is used, specific impulse is an [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] per unit mass, which [[dimensional analysis]] shows to have units of speed, and so specific impulses are often measured in meters per second and are often termed '''effective exhaust velocity'''. However, if propellant weight is used, an impulse divided by a force (weight) turns out to be a unit of time, and so specific impulses are measured in seconds. These two formulations are both widely used and differ from each other by a factor of ''[[standard gravity|g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]'', the dimensioned [[Physical constant|constant]] of [[standard gravity|gravitational acceleration]] at the surface of the Earth.

Note that the rate of change of momentum of a rocket (including its propellant) per unit time is equal to the thrust.

The higher the specific impulse, the less propellant is needed to produce a given thrust during a given time. In this regard a propellant is more efficient the greater its specific impulse. This should not be confused with energy efficiency, which can decrease as specific impulse increases, since propulsion systems that give high specific impulse require high energy to do so.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geoffreylandis.com/laser_ion_pres.htp&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important that [[thrust]] and specific impulse not be confused. The specific impulse is a measure of the ''impulse produced per unit of propellant'' expended, while thrust is a measure of the momentary or peak force supplied by a particular engine. In many cases, propulsion systems with very high specific impulses—some [[ion thruster]]s reach 10,000 seconds—produce low thrusts.&lt;ref name=&quot;exploreMarsnow&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploremarsnow.org/MissionOverview.html|title=Mission Overview|publisher=exploreMarsnow|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When calculating specific impulse, only propellant that is carried with the vehicle before use is counted. For a chemical rocket the propellant mass therefore would include both fuel and [[oxidizer]]; for air-breathing engines only the mass of the fuel is counted, not the mass of air passing through the engine.

By far the most common unit used for specific impulse today is the second, and this is used both in the SI world as well as where Imperial units are used. Its chief advantages are that its units and numerical value are identical everywhere, and essentially everyone understands it. Nearly all manufacturers quote their engine performance in seconds, and it is also useful for specifying aircraft engine performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/specimp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The effective exhaust velocity in units of m/s is also in reasonably common usage. For rocket engines it is reasonably intuitive, although for many rocket engines the effective exhaust speed is considerably different from the actual exhaust speed due to, for example, fuel and oxidizer that is dumped overboard after powering turbo-pumps. For air-breathing engines the effective exhaust velocity is not physically meaningful, although it can be used for comparison purposes nevertheless.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/propulsion/3-what-is-specific-impulse.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The values expressed in N·s/kg are not uncommonly seen and are numerically equal to the effective exhaust velocity in m/s (from [[Newton's second law]] and the definition of the newton.)

Another equivalent unit is [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]]. This has units of g/(kN·s) or lb/(lbf·h) and is inversely proportional to specific impulse. Specific fuel consumption is used extensively for describing the performance of air-breathing jet engines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/sfc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific impulse in seconds==

===General definition===
For all vehicles specific impulse (impulse per unit weight-on-Earth of propellant) in seconds can be defined by the following equation:&lt;ref name=sutton&gt;Rocket Propulsion Elements, 7th Edition by George P. Sutton, Oscar Biblarz&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{thrust} = g_0 \cdot I_\text{sp} \cdot \dot m,&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{thrust}&lt;/math&gt; is the thrust obtained from the engine, in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s (or [[pound (force)|pounds force]]),
:&lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Standard gravity|acceleration at the Earth's surface]], in m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (or ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),
:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific impulse measured in seconds,
:&lt;math&gt;\dot m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass flow rate]] in kg/s (or [[slug (mass)|slug]]s/s), which is negative the time-rate of change of the vehicle's mass (since propellant is being expelled).

The [[English unit]] [[Pound (mass)|pound mass]] is more commonly used than the slug, and when using pounds/sec for mass flow rate, the conversion constant ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; becomes unnecessary, because the slug is dimensionally equivalent to pounds divided by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{thrust} = I_\text{sp} \cdot \dot m.&lt;/math&gt;

''I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;'' in seconds is equal to the amount of time a rocket must be fired to use a quantity of propellant with weight (measured at one [[standard gravity]]) equal to its thrust.

The advantage of this formulation is that it may be used for rockets, where all the reaction mass is carried on board, as well as aeroplanes, where most of the reaction mass is taken from the atmosphere. In addition, it gives a result that is independent of units used (provided the unit of time used is the second).

[[File:Specific-impulse-kk-20090105.png|thumb|center|700px|The specific impulse of various jet engines]]

===Rocketry===
In rocketry, where the only reaction mass is the propellant, an equivalent way of calculating the specific impulse in seconds is also frequently used. In this sense, specific impulse is defined as the thrust integrated over time per unit [[weight]]-on-Earth of the propellant:&lt;ref name=&quot;SINasa&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_{\rm sp}=\frac{v_\text{e}}{g_0},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; is the specific impulse measured in seconds,

:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the average exhaust speed along the axis of the engine (in ft/s or m/s),

:''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the acceleration at the Earth's surface (in ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

In rockets, due to atmospheric effects, the specific impulse varies with altitude, reaching a maximum in a vacuum. This is because the exhaust velocity isn't simply a function of the chamber pressure, but is a function of the difference between the interior and exterior of the combustion chamber.
It is therefore important to note whether the specific impulse refers to operation in a vacuum or at sea level. Values are usually indicated with or near the units of specific impulse (e.g. &quot;sl&quot;, &quot;vac&quot;).

==Specific impulse as a speed (effective exhaust velocity)==
Because of the geocentric factor of ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the equation for specific impulse, many prefer to define the specific impulse of a rocket (in particular) in terms of thrust per unit mass flow of propellant (instead of per unit weight flow). This is an equally valid (and in some ways somewhat simpler) way of defining the effectiveness of a rocket propellant. For a rocket, the specific impulse defined in this way is simply the effective exhaust velocity relative to the rocket, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;. The two definitions of specific impulse are proportional to one another, and related to each other by:

:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{e} = g_0 I_\text{sp},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific impulse in seconds,

:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific impulse measured in [[metre per second|m/s]], which is the same as the effective exhaust velocity measured in m/s (or ft/s if g is in ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),

:&lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface, 9.81 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (in [[Imperial units]] 32.2 ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

This equation is also valid for air-breathing jet engines, but is rarely used in practice.

(Note that different symbols are sometimes used; for example, ''c'' is also sometimes seen for exhaust velocity. While the symbol &lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp}&lt;/math&gt; might logically be used for specific impulse in units of N·s/kg; to avoid confusion, it is desirable to reserve this for specific impulse measured in seconds.)

It is related to the [[thrust]], or forward force on the rocket by the equation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KEPgEgX2BEEC&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;ots=irB_Z0CinI&amp;dq=effective%20exhaust%20velocity&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q=effective%20exhaust%20velocity&amp;f=false Aerospace Propulsion Systems By Thomas A. Ward]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_\text{thrust} = v_\text{e} \cdot \dot m,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot m&lt;/math&gt; is the propellant mass flow rate, which is the rate of decrease of the vehicle's mass.

A rocket must carry all its fuel with it, so the mass of the unburned fuel must be accelerated along with the rocket itself. Minimizing the mass of fuel required to achieve a given push is crucial to building effective rockets. The [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]] shows that for a rocket with a given empty mass and a given amount of fuel, the total change in [[velocity]] it can accomplish is proportional to the effective exhaust velocity.

A spacecraft without propulsion follows an orbit determined by its trajectory and any gravitational field. Deviations from the corresponding velocity pattern (these are called [[delta v|Δ''v'']]) are achieved by sending exhaust mass in the direction opposite to that of the desired velocity change.

===Actual exhaust speed versus effective exhaust speed===

Note that '''effective''' exhaust velocity and '''actual''' exhaust velocity can be significantly different, for example when a rocket is run within the atmosphere, atmospheric pressure on the outside of the engine causes a retarding force that reduces the specific impulse, and the effective exhaust velocity goes down, whereas the actual exhaust velocity is largely unaffected. Also, sometimes rocket engines have a separate nozzle for the turbo-pump turbine gas, and then calculating the effective exhaust velocity requires averaging the two mass flows as well as accounting for any atmospheric pressure.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

For air-breathing jet engines, particularly [[turbofan]]s, the actual exhaust velocity and the effective exhaust velocity are different by orders of magnitude. This is because a good deal of additional momentum is obtained by using air as reaction mass. This allows a better match between the airspeed and the exhaust speed, which saves energy/propellant and enormously increases the effective exhaust velocity while reducing the actual exhaust velocity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Energy efficiency==

===Rockets===
For rockets and rocket-like engines such as ion-drives a higher &lt;math&gt;I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt; implies lower energy efficiency: the power needed to run the engine is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dm} {dt} \frac { v_e^2 } {2}&lt;/math&gt;

where v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the actual jet velocity.

whereas from momentum considerations the thrust generated is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dm} {dt} v_e&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing the power by the thrust to obtain the specific power requirements we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {v_e} {2}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the power needed is proportional to the exhaust velocity, with higher velocities needing higher power for the same thrust, causing less energy efficiency per unit thrust.

However, the total energy for a mission depends on total propellant use, as well as how much energy is needed per unit of propellant. For low exhaust velocity with respect to the mission delta-v, enormous amounts of reaction mass is needed. In fact a very low exhaust velocity is not energy efficient at all for this reason; but it turns out that neither are very high exhaust velocities.

Theoretically, for a given [[delta-v]], in space, among all fixed values for the exhaust speed the value &lt;math&gt;v_\text{e}=0.6275 \Delta v&lt;/math&gt; is the most energy efficient for a specified (fixed) final mass, see [[Spacecraft propulsion#Energy|energy in spacecraft propulsion]].

However, a variable exhaust speed can be more energy efficient still. For example, if a rocket is accelerated from some positive initial speed using an exhaust speed equal to the speed of the rocket no energy is lost as kinetic energy of reaction mass, since it becomes stationary.&lt;ref&gt;Note that this limits the speed of the rocket to the maximum exhaust speed.&lt;/ref&gt; (Theoretically, by making this initial speed low and using another method of obtaining this small speed, the energy efficiency approaches 100%, but requires a large initial mass.) In this case the rocket keeps the same [[momentum]], so its speed is inversely proportional to its remaining mass. During such a flight the kinetic energy of the rocket is proportional to its speed and, correspondingly, inversely proportional to its remaining mass. The power needed per unit acceleration is constant throughout the flight; the reaction mass to be expelled per unit time to produce a given acceleration is proportional to the square of the rocket's remaining mass.

Also it is advantageous to expel reaction mass at a location where the [[gravity potential]] is low, see [[Oberth effect]].

===Air breathing===
Air-breathing engines such as [[turbojet]]s increase the momentum generated from their propellant by using it to power the acceleration of inert air rearwards. It turns out that the amount of energy needed to generate a particular amount of thrust is inversely proportional to the amount of air propelled rearwards, thus increasing the mass of air (as with a [[turbofan]]) both improves energy efficiency as well as &lt;math&gt;I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
:''For a more complete list see: [[Spacecraft propulsion#Table of methods]]''
{{Specific impulse examples}}

An example of a specific impulse measured in time is 453 [[second]]s, which is equivalent to an [[effective exhaust velocity]] of 4,440 [[metre per second|m/s]], for the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s when operating in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronautix.com/engines/ssme.htm&lt;/ref&gt; An air-breathing jet engine typically has a much larger specific impulse than a rocket; for example a [[turbofan]] jet engine may have a specific impulse of 6,000 seconds or more at sea level whereas a rocket would be around 200–400 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/SPRING/propulsion/notes/node85.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An air-breathing engine is thus much more propellant efficient than a rocket engine, because the actual exhaust speed is much lower, the air provides an oxidizer, and air is used as reaction mass. Since the physical exhaust velocity is lower, the kinetic energy the exhaust carries away is lower and thus the jet engine uses far less energy to generate thrust (at subsonic speeds).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dunnspace.com/isp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''actual'' exhaust velocity is lower for air-breathing engines, the ''effective'' exhaust velocity is very high for jet engines. This is because the effective exhaust velocity calculation essentially assumes that the propellant is providing all the thrust, and hence is not physically meaningful for air-breathing engines; nevertheless, it is useful for comparison with other types of engines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/198045/effective-exhaust-velocity&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest specific impulse for a chemical propellant ever test-fired in a rocket engine was 542 seconds (5,320&amp;nbsp;m/s) with a [[Tripropellant rocket|tripropellant]] of [[lithium]], [[fluorine]], and [[hydrogen]]. However, this combination is impractical; see [[rocket fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;ARBIT, H. A., CLAPP, S. D., DICKERSON, R. A., NAGAI, C. K., [http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=mtgpaper&amp;gID=40999 Combustion characteristics of the fluorine-lithium/hydrogen tripropellant combination.] AMERICAN INST OF AERONAUTICS AND ASTRONAUTICS, PROPULSION JOINT SPECIALIST CONFERENCE, 4TH, CLEVELAND, OHIO, June 10–14, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear thermal rocket]] engines differ from conventional rocket engines in that thrust is created strictly through thermodynamic phenomena, with no chemical reaction.&lt;ref&gt;http://trajectory.grc.nasa.gov/projects/ntp/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The nuclear rocket typically operates by passing hydrogen gas through a superheated nuclear core. Testing in the 1960s yielded specific impulses of about 850 seconds (8,340&amp;nbsp;m/s), about twice that of the Space Shuttle engines.

A variety of other non-rocket propulsion methods, such as [[ion thruster]]s, give much higher specific impulse but with much lower thrust; for example the [[Hall effect thruster]] on the [[SMART-1]] satellite has a specific impulse of 1,640 s (16,100&amp;nbsp;m/s) but a maximum thrust of only 68 millinewtons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mendeley.com/research/characterization-of-a-high-specific-impulse-xenon-hall-effect-thruster/&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket]] (VASIMR) engine currently in development will theoretically yield 20,000−300,000&amp;nbsp;m/s, and a maximum thrust of 5.7 newtons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adastrarocket.com/AdAstra%20Release%2023Nov2010final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Larger engines===
Here are some example numbers for larger jet and rocket engines:

===Model rocketry===
Specific impulse is also used to measure performance in model rocket motors. Following are some of Estes' claimed values for specific impulses for several of their rocket motors:&lt;ref&gt;Estes 2011 Catalog www.acsupplyco.com/estes/estes_cat_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estes Industries]] is a large, well-known American seller of model rocket components. The specific impulse for these model rocket motors is much lower than for many other rocket motors because the manufacturer uses black powder propellant and emphasizes safety rather than maximum performance. The burn rate and hence chamber pressure and maximum thrust of model rocket motors is also tightly controlled.

the magnetic fields &quot;B&quot; (magnetic flux density) and &quot;H&quot;|magnetic field|}}
{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Magnetostatics}}

In [[physics]], specifically [[electromagnetism]], the '''magnetic flux''' (often denoted {{math|Φ}} or {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;'''''B'''''&lt;/sub&gt;}}) through a surface is the surface integral of the normal component of the [[magnetic field]] '''B''' passing through that surface. The [[SI]] [[unit of measurement|unit]] of magnetic flux is the [[Weber (unit)|weber]] (Wb) (in derived units: volt-seconds), and the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] unit is the [[Maxwell (unit)|maxwell]]. Magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils and [[electronics]], that evaluates the change of [[voltage]] in the measuring coils to calculate the magnetic flux.

==Description==
 {{multiple image
   | align = right
   | direction = vertical
   | image1    = Surface integral illustration.svg
   | caption1  = The magnetic flux through a surface when the magnetic field is variable relies on splitting the surface into small surface elements, over which the magnetic field can be considered to be locally constant. The total flux is then a formal summation of these surface elements (see [[surface integral|surface integration]]).
   | width1     = 250
   | image2    = Surface normal.png
   | caption2  = Each point on a surface is associated with a direction, called the [[surface normal]]; the magnetic flux through a point is then the component of the magnetic field along this direction.
   | width2     = 250
  }}
The magnetic interaction is described in terms of a [[vector field]], where each point in space (and time) is associated with a vector that determines what force a moving charge would experience at that point (see [[Lorentz force]]). Since a vector field is quite difficult to visualize at first, in elementary physics one may instead visualize this field with [[field line]]s. The magnetic flux through some surface, in this simplified picture, is proportional to the number of field lines passing through that surface (in some contexts, the flux may be defined to be precisely the number of field lines passing through that surface; although technically misleading, this distinction is not important). Note that the magnetic flux is the ''net'' number of field lines passing through that surface; that is, the number passing through in one direction minus the number passing through in the other direction (see below for deciding in which direction the field lines carry a positive sign and in which they carry a negative sign).
In more advanced physics, the field line analogy is dropped and the magnetic flux is properly defined as the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field passing through a surface. If the magnetic field is constant, the magnetic flux passing through a surface of [[vector area]] '''S''' is
:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_B = \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{S} = BS \cos \theta,
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''B''' is the magnitude of the magnetic field (the magnetic flux density) having the unit of Wb/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Tesla (unit)|tesla]]), '''S''' is the area of the surface, and ''θ'' is the angle between the magnetic [[field line]]s and the [[surface normal|normal (perpendicular)]] to '''S'''. For a varying magnetic field, we first consider the magnetic flux through an infinitesimal area element d'''S''', where we may consider the field to be constant: 
:&lt;math&gt;
d\Phi_B = \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{S}.
&lt;/math&gt;
A generic surface, '''S''', can then be broken into infinitesimal elements and the total magnetic flux through the surface is then the [[surface integral]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_B = \iint\limits_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf S.
&lt;/math&gt;
From the definition of the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''' and the [[Stokes' theorem|fundamental theorem of the curl]] the magnetic flux may also be defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_B = \oint\limits_{\partial S} \mathbf{A} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell},&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[line integral]] is taken over the boundary of the surface ''S'', which is denoted ∂''S''.

==Magnetic flux through a closed surface==

[[File:SurfacesWithAndWithoutBoundary.svg|right|thumb|200px|Some examples of [[closed surface]]s (left) and [[open surface]]s (right). Left: Surface of a sphere, surface of a [[torus]], surface of a cube. Right: [[Disk (mathematics)|Disk surface]], square surface, surface of a hemisphere. (The surface is blue, the boundary is red.)]]

{{Main|Gauss's law for magnetism}}

[[Gauss's law for magnetism]], which is one of the four [[Maxwell's equations]], states that the total magnetic flux through a [[closed surface]] is equal to zero. (A &quot;closed surface&quot; is a surface that completely encloses a volume(s) with no holes.) This law is a consequence of the empirical observation that [[magnetic monopole]]s have never been found.

In other words, Gauss's law for magnetism is the statement:

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\Phi_B=\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf S = 0&lt;/math&gt;}}

for any [[closed surface]] ''S''.
{{-}}

==Magnetic flux through an open surface==

{{Main|Faraday's law of induction}}

[[Image:Vector field on a surface.PNG|right|thumb|250px|For an open surface Σ, the [[electromotive force]] along the surface boundary, ∂Σ, is a combination of the boundary's motion, with velocity '''v''', through a magnetic field '''B''' (illustrated by the generic '''F''' field in the diagram) and the induced electric field caused by the changing magnetic field.]]

While the magnetic flux through a [[closed surface]] is always zero, the magnetic flux through an [[open surface]] need not be zero and is an important quantity in electromagnetism. For example, a change in the magnetic flux passing through a loop of conductive wire will cause an [[electromotive force]], and therefore an electric current, in the loop.  The relationship is given by [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = \oint_{\partial \Sigma}\left(  \mathbf{E} +\mathbf{ v \times B}\right) \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = -{d\Phi_B \over dt},&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the electromotive force ([[electromotive force|EMF]]),
:Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnetic flux through the open surface Σ,
:∂Σ is the boundary of the open surface Σ; note that the surface, in general, may be in motion and deforming, and so is generally a function of time. The electromotive force is induced along this boundary.
:d'''ℓ''' is an [[infinitesimal]] vector element of the contour ∂Σ,
:'''v''' is the velocity of the boundary ∂Σ,
:'''E''' is the [[electric field]],
:'''B''' is the [[magnetic field]].

The two equations for the EMF are, firstly, the work per unit charge done against the [[Lorentz force]] in moving a test charge around the (possibly moving) surface boundary ∂Σ and, secondly, as the change of magnetic flux through the open surface Σ. This equation is the principle behind an [[electrical generator]].

==Comparison with electric flux==

{{Main|Electric flux|Gauss's law}}

By way of contrast, [[Gauss's law|Gauss's law for electric fields]], another of [[Maxwell's equations]], is

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\Phi_E =\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{S} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;}}

where
:'''E''' is the [[electric field]],
:''S'' is any [[closed surface]],
:''Q'' is the total [[electric charge]] inside the surface ''S'',
:''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electric constant]] (a universal constant, also called the &quot;[[permittivity]] of free space&quot;).

Note that the [[electric flux|flux of '''E''']] through a closed surface is ''not'' always zero; this indicates the presence of &quot;electric monopoles&quot;, that is, free positive or negative [[electric charge|charges]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6108">{{See also|Light intensity (disambiguation)}}
In [[Photometry (optics)|photometry]], '''luminous intensity''' is a measure of the [[wavelength]]-weighted [[Power (physics)|power]] emitted by a [[light source]] in a particular direction per unit [[solid angle]], based on the [[luminosity function]], a standardized model of the sensitivity of the [[human eye]]. The [[SI]] unit of luminous intensity is the [[candela]]&amp;nbsp;(cd), an [[SI base unit]].

Photometry deals with the measurement of visible light as perceived by human eyes. The human eye can only see light in the [[visible spectrum]] and has different sensitivities to [[light]] of different wavelengths within the spectrum. When adapted for bright conditions ([[photopic vision]]), the eye is most sensitive to greenish-yellow light at 555&amp;nbsp;nm. Light with the same [[radiant intensity]] at other wavelengths has a lower luminous intensity. The curve which measures the response of the human eye to light is a defined standard, known as the [[luminosity function]]. This curve, denoted ''V''(&amp;lambda;) or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \overline{y}(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, is based on an average of widely differing experimental data from scientists using different measurement techniques. For instance, the measured responses of the eye to violet light varied by a factor of ten.

==Relationship to other measures==
Luminous intensity should not be confused with another photometric unit, [[luminous flux]], which is the total perceived power emitted in all directions. Luminous intensity is the perceived power ''per unit solid angle''. If a lamp has a 1 lumen bulb and the optics of the lamp are set up to focus the light evenly into a 1 [[steradian]] beam, then the beam would have a luminous intensity of 1 candela. If the optics were changed to concentrate the beam into 1/2 steradian then the source would have a luminous intensity of 2 candela. The resulting beam is narrower and brighter, though its luminous flux remains unchanged.

Luminous intensity is also not the same as the [[radiant intensity]], the corresponding objective [[physical quantity]] used in the measurement science of [[radiometry]].

==Units==
Like other SI base units, the candela has an [[operational definition]]&amp;mdash;it is defined by the description of a physical process that will produce one candela of luminous intensity. By definition, if one constructs a light source that emits monochromatic green light with a frequency of 540&amp;nbsp;THz, and that has a radiant intensity of 1/683&amp;nbsp;[[watt]]s per [[steradian]] in a given direction, that light source will emit one candela in the specified direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 | title = Base unit definitions: Candela
 | work = The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty
 | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/candela.html
 | accessdate = 8 February 2008
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency of light used in the definition corresponds to a wavelength of 555&amp;nbsp;nm, which is near the peak of the eye's response to light. If the source emitted uniformly in all directions, the total [[radiant flux]] would be about 18.40&amp;nbsp;mW, since there are 4&amp;pi;&amp;nbsp;steradians in a sphere. A typical candle produces very roughly one candela of luminous intensity.

Prior to the definition of the candela, a variety of units for luminous intensity were used in various countries. These were typically based on the brightness of the flame from a &quot;standard candle&quot; of defined composition, or the brightness of an incandescent filament of specific design. One of the best-known of these standards was the [[England|English]] standard: [[candlepower]]. One candlepower was the light produced by a pure [[spermaceti]] candle weighing one sixth of a pound and burning at a rate of 120&amp;nbsp;[[Grain (mass)|grains]] per hour. Germany, Austria, and Scandinavia used the [[Hefnerkerze]], a unit based on the output of a [[Hefner lamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/hefner.htm |title=Hefner unit, or Hefner candle |work=Sizes.com |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, [[Jules Violle]] proposed the ''[[Violle]]'' as a unit of luminous intensity, and it was notable as the first unit of light intensity that did not depend on the properties of a particular lamp. All of these units were superseded by the definition of the candela.

==Usage==
The luminous intensity for monochromatic light of a particular wavelength &amp;lambda; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{v} = 683 \cdot \overline{y}(\lambda) \cdot I_\mathrm{e},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''I''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the luminous intensity in candelas&amp;nbsp;(cd),
:''I''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the radiant intensity in watts per steradian&amp;nbsp;(W/sr),
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \overline{y}(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Luminosity function|standard luminosity function]].

If more than one wavelength is present (as is usually the case), one must sum or integrate over the [[spectrum]] of wavelengths present to get the luminous intensity:

&lt;!-- TBD: Is integral from 0 to infinity really correct, or should it better be 380nm to 780nm here? --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{v} = 683 \int^\infin_0 \overline{y}(\lambda) \cdot \frac{dI_\mathrm{e}(\lambda)}{d\lambda} \, d\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4402">In [[physics]], '''jounce''' or '''snap''' is the fourth [[derivative]] of the [[Position_(vector)|position vector]] with respect to [[time]], with the first, second, and third derivatives being [[velocity]], [[acceleration]], and [[jerk (physics)|jerk]], respectively; hence, the jounce is the rate of change of the jerk with respect to time. Jounce is defined by any of the following equivalent expressions:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec s =\frac {d \vec j} {dt}=\frac {d^2 \vec a} {dt^2}=\frac {d^3 \vec v} {dt^3}=\frac {d^4 \vec r} {dt^4}&lt;/math&gt;

The following equations are used for constant jounce:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec j = \vec j_0 + \vec s \,t &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\vec a = \vec a_0 + \vec j_0 \,t + \frac{1}{2} \vec s \,t^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\vec v = \vec v_0 + \vec a_0 \,t + \frac{1}{2} \vec j_0 \,t^2 + \frac{1}{6} \vec s \,t^3 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\vec r = \vec r_0 + \vec v_0 \,t + \frac{1}{2} \vec a_0 \,t^2 + \frac{1}{6} \vec j_0 \,t^3 + \frac{1}{24} \vec s \,t^4 &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\vec s&lt;/math&gt; : constant jounce,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec j_0&lt;/math&gt; : initial jerk,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec j&lt;/math&gt; : final jerk,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec a_0&lt;/math&gt; : initial acceleration,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec a&lt;/math&gt; : final acceleration,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec v_0&lt;/math&gt; : initial velocity,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; : final velocity,

== &lt;math&gt;\vec r_0&lt;/math&gt; : initial position, ==
:&lt;math&gt;\vec r&lt;/math&gt; : final position,
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; : time between initial and final states.

The notation &lt;math&gt;\vec s&lt;/math&gt; (used in &lt;ref name=MVisser1 /&gt;) is not to be confused with the [[displacement vector]] commonly denoted similarly. Currently, there are no well-accepted designations for the derivatives of jounce. The fourth, fifth and sixth derivatives of position as a function of time are &quot;sometimes somewhat facetiously&quot;&lt;ref name=MVisser1&gt;

The dimensions of jounce are distance per (time to the power of 4). In [[SI units]], this is &quot;metres per quartic second&quot;, &quot;metres per second per second per second per second&quot;, m/s&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, m &amp;middot; s&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;, or 100 [[Gal (unit)|Gal]] per second squared in [[CGS]] units. This pattern continues for higher order derivatives, with the 5th being m/s&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Scale of temperature''' is a way to [[Measurement|measure]] [[temperature]] quantitatively.

==Formal description==
According to the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]], being in thermal equilibrium is an [[equivalence relation]]. Thus all thermal systems may be divided into a [[quotient set]] by this equivalence relation, denoted below as '''M'''. Assume the set '''M''' has the [[cardinality]] of '''c''', then one can construct an [[injective function]] ƒ:&amp;nbsp;'''M'''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;, by which every thermal system will have a number associated with it such that when and only when two thermal systems have the same such value, they will be in thermal equilibrium. This is clearly the property of temperature, and the specific way of assigning numerical values as temperature is called a ''scale of temperature''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The concepts of classical thermodynamics|publisher=Cambridge U.P.1966.|isbn=978-0-521-04359-5|author=H A Buchdahl|chapter=2.Zeroth law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistical mechanics : an intermediate course|publisher=Singapore ; River Edge, N.J. : World Scientific, ©2001|isbn=978-981-02-4477-4|pages=6~7|author=Giuseppe Morandi|author2=F Napoli |author3=E Ercolessi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics|publisher=New York [u.a.] : Springer, 2004|pages=6~7|author=Walter Greiner|author2=Ludwig Neise |author3=Horst Stöcker }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practical terms, a temperature scale is always based on usually a single physical property of a simple thermodynamic system, called a thermometer, that defines a scaling function mapping the temperature to the measurable thermometric parameter. Such temperature scales that are purely based on measurement are called ''empirical temperature scales''.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] provides a fundamental, natural definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] starting with a null point of [[absolute zero]]. A scale for thermodynamic temperature is established similarly to the empirical temperature scales, however, needing only one additional fixing point.

==Empirical scales==
Empirical scales are based on the measurement of physical parameters that express the property of interest to be measured through some formal, most commonly a simple linear, functional relationship. For the measurement of temperature, the formal definition of thermal equilibrium in terms of the thermodynamic coordinate spaces of thermodynamic systems, expressed in the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]], provides the framework to measure temperature.

All temperature scales, including the modern thermodynamic temperature scale used in the [[International System of Units]], are calibrated according to thermal properties of a particular substance or device. Typically, this is established by fixing two well-defined temperature points and defining temperature increments via a linear function of the response of the thermometric device. For example, both the old [[Celsius scale]] and [[Fahrenheit scale]] were originally based on the linear expansion of a narrow mercury column within a limited range of temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg| isbn = 978-3-540-85417-3| last = Carl S. Helrich| title = Modern Thermodynamics with Statistical Mechanics| location = Berlin, Heidelberg| year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; each using different reference points and scale increments.

Different empirical scales may not be compatible with each other, except for small regions of temperature overlap. If an alcohol [[thermometer]] and a mercury [[thermometer]] have same two fixed points, namely the freezing and boiling point of water, their reading will not agree with each other except at the fixed points, as the linear 1:1 relationship of expansion between any two thermometric substances may not be guaranteed.

Empirical temperature scales are not reflective of the fundamental, microscopic laws of matter. Temperature is a universal attribute of matter, yet empirical scales map a narrow range onto a scale that is known to have a useful functional form for a particular application. Thus, their range is limited. The working material only exists in a form under certain circumstances, beyond which it no longer can serve as a scale. For example, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] freezes below 234.32&amp;nbsp;K, so temperature lower than that cannot be measured in a scale based on mercury. Even [[ITS-90]], which interpolates among different ranges of temperature, has only a range of 0.65&amp;nbsp;K to approximately 1358&amp;nbsp;K (−272.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 1085&amp;nbsp;°C).

===Ideal gas scale===
When pressure approaches zero, all real gas will behave like ideal gas, that is, {{math|pV}} of a mole of gas relying only on temperature. Therefore we can design a scale with {{math|pV}} as its argument. Of course any bijective function will do, but for convenience's sake linear function is the best. Therefore we define it as &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/solliqth/solliqth.html|title=Thermometers and the Ideal Gas Temperature Scale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;T={1 \over nR}\lim_{p \to 0}{pV}.&lt;/math&gt;

The ideal gas scale is in some sense a &quot;mixed&quot; scale. It relies on the universal properties of gas, a big advance from just a particular substance. But still it is empirical since it puts gas at a special position and thus has limited applicability&amp;mdash;at some point no gas can exist. One distinguishing characteristic of ideal gas scale, however, is that it precisely equals thermodynamical scale when it is well defined (see [[#Equality to ideal gas scale|below]]).

=== International temperature scale of 1990 ===
{{main|ITS-90}}

ITS-90 is designed to represent the thermodynamic temperature scale (referencing [[absolute zero]]) as closely as possible throughout its range.  Many different thermometer designs are required to cover the entire range. These include helium vapor pressure thermometers, helium gas thermometers, [[resistance thermometer|standard platinum resistance thermometers]] (known as SPRTs, PRTs or Platinum RTDs) and [[infrared thermometer|monochromatic radiation thermometers]].

Although the Kelvin and Celsius scales are defined using absolute zero (0&amp;nbsp;K) and the [[triple point]] of water (273.16&amp;nbsp;K and 0.01&amp;nbsp;°C), it is impractical to use this definition at temperatures that are very different from the triple point of water. Accordingly, ITS–90 uses numerous defined points, all of which are based on various thermodynamic equilibrium states of fourteen pure [[chemical elements]] and one [[Chemical compound|compound]] (water).  Most of the defined points are based on a [[phase transition]]; specifically the [[Melting point|melting]]/[[freezing]] point of a pure chemical element.  However, the deepest [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] points are based exclusively on the [[vapor pressure]]/temperature relationship of helium and its isotopes whereas the remainder of its cold points (those less than room temperature) are based on [[triple point]]s.  Examples of other defining points are the triple point of hydrogen (−259.3467&amp;nbsp;°C) and the freezing point of aluminum (660.323&amp;nbsp;°C).

Thermometers calibrated per ITS–90 use complex mathematical formulas to interpolate between its defined points.  ITS–90 specifies rigorous control over variables to ensure reproducibility from lab to lab.  For instance, the small effect that atmospheric pressure has upon the various melting points is compensated for (an effect that typically amounts to no more than half a [[millikelvin]] across the different altitudes and barometric pressures likely to be encountered). The standard even compensates for the pressure effect due to how deeply the temperature probe is immersed into the sample.  ITS–90 also draws a distinction between “freezing” and “melting” points.  The distinction depends on whether heat is going ''into'' (melting) or ''out of'' (freezing) the sample when the measurement is made.  Only gallium is measured while melting, all the other metals are measured while the samples are freezing.

There are often small differences between measurements calibrated per ITS–90 and thermodynamic temperature.  For instance, precise measurements show that the boiling point of [[VSMOW]] water under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339&amp;nbsp;K (99.9839&amp;nbsp;°C) when adhering ''strictly'' to the two-point definition of thermodynamic temperature.  When calibrated to ITS–90, where one must interpolate between the defining points of gallium and indium, the boiling point of VSMOW water is about 10 mK less, about 99.974&amp;nbsp;°C.  The virtue of ITS–90 is that another lab in another part of the world will measure the very same temperature with ease due to the advantages of a comprehensive international calibration standard featuring many conveniently spaced, reproducible, defining points spanning a wide range of temperatures.

== Celsius scale ==
{{main|Celsius}}

Celsius (known until 1948 as centigrade) is a [[temperature]] scale that is named after the Swedish astronomer [[Anders Celsius]] (1701&amp;ndash;1744), who developed a similar temperature scale two years before his death. The degree Celsius (°C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature ''[[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] ''(a difference between two temperatures or an [[uncertainty]]).

From 1744 until 1954, 0&amp;nbsp;°C was defined as the freezing point of water and 100&amp;nbsp;°C was defined as the boiling point of water, both at a pressure of one [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Although these defining correlations are commonly taught in schools today, by international agreement the unit &quot;degree Celsius&quot; and the Celsius scale are currently defined by two different points: [[absolute zero]], and the [[triple point]] of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water|VSMOW]] (specially prepared water). This definition also precisely relates the Celsius scale to the [[Kelvin]] scale, which defines the [[SI]] [[SI base unit|base unit]] of [[thermodynamic temperature]] (symbol: K). Absolute zero, the hypothetical but unattainable temperature at which matter exhibits zero entropy, is defined as being precisely 0&amp;nbsp;K ''and'' −273.15&amp;nbsp;°C. The temperature value of the triple point of water is defined as being precisely 273.16&amp;nbsp;K ''and'' 0.01&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name='BIPMbrocure'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html |title=SI brochure, section 2.1.1.5 |accessdate=9 May 2008 |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree Celsius and the kelvin as precisely 1 part in 273.16 parts, the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water. Thus, it sets the magnitude of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin as exactly the same. Additionally, it establishes the difference between the two scales' null points as being precisely 273.15 degrees Celsius (−273.15&amp;nbsp;°C&amp;nbsp;= 0&amp;nbsp;K and 0&amp;nbsp;°C&amp;nbsp;= 273.15&amp;nbsp;K).&lt;ref name='nistphys'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html |title=Essentials of the SI: Base &amp; derived units |accessdate=9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermodynamic scale ==
{{see also|Thermodynamic temperature|Kelvin}}

Thermodynamic scale differs from empirical scales in that it is absolute. It is based on the fundamental laws of thermodynamics or statistical mechanics instead of some arbitrary chosen working material. Besides it covers full range of temperature and has simple relation with microscopic quantities like the average kinetic energy of particles (see [[equipartition theorem]]). In experiments ITS-90 is used to approximate thermodynamic scale due to simpler realization.

=== Definition ===

[[Lord Kelvin]] devised the thermodynamic scale based on the efficiency of heat engines as shown below:

The efficiency of an engine is the work divided by the heat introduced to the system or

: &lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac {w_{cy}}{q_H} = \frac{q_H-q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \frac{q_C}{q_H} \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;,

where w&lt;sub&gt;cy&lt;/sub&gt; is the work done per cycle. Thus, the efficiency depends only on q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;/q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;.

Because of [[Carnot theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot theorem]], any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must have the same efficiency, meaning, the efficiency is the function of the temperatures only:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C)\qquad (2).&lt;/math&gt;

In addition, a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and another (intermediate) temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the second between ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;and''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This can only be the case if

: &lt;math&gt;

f(T_1,T_3) = \frac{q_3}{q_1} = \frac{q_2 q_3} {q_1 q_2} = f(T_1,T_2)f(T_2,T_3).
&lt;/math&gt;

Specializing to the case that &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed reference temperature: the temperature of the triple point of water. Then for any''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;f(T_2,T_3) = \frac{f(T_1,T_3)}{f(T_1,T_2)} = \frac{273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T_3)}{273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T_2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, if thermodynamic temperature is defined by

: &lt;math&gt;T = 273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T) \,&lt;/math&gt;

then the function ''f'', viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature, is

: &lt;math&gt;f(T_2,T_3) = \frac{T_3}{T_2},&lt;/math&gt;

and the reference temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has the value 273.16. (Of course any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be used—the choice here corresponds to the [[Kelvin]] scale.)

=== Equality to ideal gas scale ===

It follows immediately that

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C) = \frac{T_C}{T_H}.\qquad (3).&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting Equation 3 back into Equation 1 gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature:

: &lt;math&gt;\eta = 1 - \frac{q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}\qquad (4).&lt;/math&gt;

This is identical to the efficiency formula for [[Carnot cycle]], which effectively employs the ideal gas scale. So this means the two scales equals numerically at every point.

In  electricity [[electromagnetism]], the '''electric susceptibility''' &lt;math&gt;\chi_{\text{e}}&lt;/math&gt; ([[latin]]: ''susceptibilis'' “receptive”) is a dimensionless proportionality constant that indicates the degree of [[polarization (electrostatics)|polarization]] of a [[dielectric]] material in response to an applied [[electric field]]. The greater the electric susceptibility, the greater the ability of a material to polarize in response to the field, and thereby reduce the total electric field inside the material (and store energy). It is in this way that the electric susceptibility influences the electric [[permittivity]] of the material and thus influences many other phenomena in that medium, from the capacitance of [[capacitors]] to the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref name=brit&gt;

==Definition of volume susceptibility==

Electric susceptibility is defined as the constant of proportionality (which may be a ) relating an [[electric field]] '''E''' to the induced [[dielectric]] [[polarization (electrostatics)|polarization density]] '''P''' such that:

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P}=\varepsilon_0\chi_{\text{e}}{\mathbf E},&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the polarization density;
* &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Vacuum permittivity|electric permittivity of free space]];
* &lt;math&gt;\chi_{\text{e}}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric susceptibility;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric field.

The susceptibility is also related to the [[polarizability]] of individual particles in the medium by the [[Clausius-Mossotti relation]]. The susceptibility is related to its [[relative permittivity]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\textrm{r}}&lt;/math&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_{\text{e}}\ = \varepsilon_{\text{r}} - 1&lt;/math&gt;

So in the case of a vacuum:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_{\text{e}}\ =  0&lt;/math&gt;

At the same time, the [[electric displacement]] '''D''' is related to the polarization density '''P''' by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} \ = \ \varepsilon_0\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} \ = \ \varepsilon_0 (1+\chi_{\text{e}}) \mathbf{E} \ = \ \varepsilon_{\text{r}} \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Molecular polarizability==

A similar parameter exists to relate the magnitude of the induced [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] '''p''' of an individual [[molecule]] to the local electric field '''E''' that induced the dipole. This parameter is the ''molecular polarizability'' (''α''), and the dipole moment resulting from the local electric field '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;local&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=\varepsilon_0\alpha \mathbf{E_{\text{local}}}&lt;/math&gt;

This introduces a complication however, as locally the field can differ significantly from the overall applied field. We have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = N \mathbf{p} = N \varepsilon_0 \alpha \mathbf{E}_\text{local},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''P''' is the polarization per unit volume, and ''N'' is the number of molecules per unit volume contributing to the polarization. Thus, if the local electric field is parallel to the ambient electric field, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_{\text{e}} \mathbf{E} = N \alpha \mathbf{E}_{\text{local}}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus only if the local field equals the ambient field can we write:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_{\text{e}}\ =  N \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

== Nonlinear susceptibility ==

In many materials the polarizability starts to saturate at high values of electric field. This saturation can be modelled by a '''nonlinear susceptibility'''. These susceptibilities are important in [[nonlinear optics]] and lead to effects such as [[second harmonic generation]] (such as used to convert infrared light into visible light, in green [[laser pointer]]s).

The standard definition of nonlinear susceptibilities in SI units is via a [[Taylor expansion]] of the polarization's reaction to electric field:&lt;ref&gt;Paul N. Butcher, David Cotter, ''The Elements of Nonlinear Optics''&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P = P_0 + \varepsilon_0 \chi^{(1)} E + \varepsilon_0 \chi^{(2)} E^2 + \varepsilon_0 \chi^{(3)} E^3 + \cdots. &lt;/math&gt;
(Except in [[ferroelectric]] materials, the built-in polarization is zero, &lt;math&gt;P_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.)
The first susceptibility term, &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;, corresponds to the linear susceptibility described above. While this first term is dimensionless, the subsequent nonlinear susceptibilities &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; have units of {{math|(m/V)&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The nonlinear susceptibilities can be generalized to anisotropic materials (where each susceptibility &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; becomes an ''n+1''-rank [[tensor]]).

==Dispersion and causality==
[[File:Dielectric constant as a function of light frequency.pdf|thumb|right|alt= .|Schematic plot of the dielectric constant as a function of light frequency showing several resonances and plateaus indicating the activation of certain processes which can respond to the perturbation on the timescales of the frequency of the light. This demonstrates that thinking of the susceptibility in terms of its Fourier transform is useful, as light is a constant-frequency perturbation to a material]]
In general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field, and so the more general formulation as a function of time is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(t)=\varepsilon_0 \int_{-\infty}^t \chi_{\text{e}}(t-t') \mathbf{E}(t')\, dt'.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the polarization is a [[convolution]] of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by &lt;math&gt;\chi_{\text{e}}(\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt;.   The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines &lt;math&gt;\chi_{\text{e}}(\Delta t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. An instantaneous response corresponds to [[Dirac delta function]] susceptibility &lt;math&gt;\chi_{\text{e}}(\Delta t) = \chi_{\text{e}}\delta(\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt;.

It is more convenient in a linear system to take the [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] and write this relationship as a function of frequency.  Due to the [[convolution theorem]], the integral becomes a simple product,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(\omega) = \varepsilon_0 \chi_{\text{e}}(\omega) \mathbf{E}(\omega).&lt;/math&gt;

This frequency dependence of the susceptibility leads to frequency dependence of the permittivity. The shape of the susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties of the material.

Moreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\chi_{\text{e}}(\Delta t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), a consequence of [[causality]], imposes [[Kramers–Kronig relation|Kramers–Kronig constraints]] on the susceptibility &lt;math&gt;\chi_{\text{e}}(0)&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring''' ('''QCM-D''') is a special type of [[Quartz crystal microbalance|QCM]] based on the ring-down technique. It is used in interfacial acoustic sensing.  Its most common application is the determination of a film thickness in a liquid environment (such as the thickness of an adsorbed protein layer).  It can be used to investigate further properties of the sample, most notably the layer's softness. 

Ring-down as a method to interrogate acoustic resonators was established in 1954. &lt;ref name=Sittel&gt;{{cite journal | author= K. Sittel, P. E. Rouse, E.D.

Steinem and A. Janshoff | publisher= Springer|place= Heidelberg|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The application of an AC voltage over the electrodes causes the crystal to oscillate at its acoustic resonance frequency. When the AC voltage is turned off, the oscillation decays exponentially (&quot;rings down&quot;). This decay is recorded and the resonance frequency (f) and the energy dissipation factor (D) are extracted. D is defined as the loss of energy per oscillation period divided by the total energy stored in the system. D is equal to the resonance bandwidth divided by the resonance frequency. Other QCM instruments determine the bandwidth from the conductance spectra.  Being a QCM, the QCM-D works in real-time, does not need labeling, and is surface-sensitive.  Current QCM-D equipment enables measuring of more than 200 data points per second.

Changes in the resonance frequency (Δf) are primarily related to mass uptake or release at the sensor surface.  When employed as a mass sensor, the instrument has a sensitivity of about 0.5&amp;nbsp;ng/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; according to the manufacturer.  Changes in the dissipation factor (ΔD) are primarily related to the viscoelasticity (softness).&lt;ref name=PCCP&gt;{{cite journal | author=  D. Johannsmann|title=Viscoelastic, mechanical, and dielectric measurements on complex samples with the quartz crystal microbalance| journal =  Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|pages= 4516–34|year=2008 | volume = 10 | doi=  10.1039/b803960g | pmid=  18665301 | issue=  31 | bibcode=2008PCCP...10.4516J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The softness, in turn, often is related to structural changes of the film adhering at the sensor surface. 

When operated as a mass sensor, the QCM-D is often used to study molecular adsorption/desorption and binding kinetics to various types of surfaces.  In contrast to optical techniques such as [[surface plasmon resonance]] (SPR) spectroscopy, [[ellipsometry]], or [[dual polarisation interferometry]], the QCM determines the mass of the adsorbed film including trapped solvent.  Comparison of the „acoustic thickness“ as determined with the QCM and the „optical thickness“ as determined by any of the optical techniques therefore allows to estimate the degree of swelling of the film in the ambient liquid.&lt;ref name=QCM_SPR&gt;{{cite journal | author= M.A. Plunkett, M. A., Z.H. Wang, M.W. Rutland, D. Johannsmann |title=Adsorption of pNIPAM layers on hydrophobic gold surfaces, measured in situ by QCM and SPR| journal =  Langmuir|pages= 6837–6844|year=2003 | volume = 19 | doi= 10.1021/la034281a }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since the softness of the sample is affected by a large variety of parameters, the QCM-D is useful for studying molecular interactions with surfaces as well as interactions between molecules. The QCM-D is commonly used in the fields of [[biomaterials]], cell adhesion, drug discovery, materials science, and biophysics.  Other typical applications are characterizing viscoelastic films, conformational changes of deposited macromolecules, build-up of polyelectrolyte multilayers, and degradation or corrosion of films and coatings.

In [[thermal physics]] and [[thermodynamics]], the '''heat capacity ratio''' or '''adiabatic index''' or '''ratio of specific heats''' or '''Poisson constant''', is the ratio of the [[heat capacity]] at constant pressure (&lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt;) to heat capacity at constant volume (&lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt;). It is sometimes also known as the ''[[isentropic]] expansion factor'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; ([[Gamma (letter)|gamma]])(for ideal gas) or &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; ([[kappa]])(isentropic exponent, for real gas). The former symbol gamma is primarily used by chemical engineers. Mechanical engineers use the [[Latin alphabet|Roman]] letter &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, R., A. McDonald, P. Pritchard: Introduction to Fluid Mechanics 6th ed. Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V} = \frac{c_P}{c_V}&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the heat capacity and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[specific heat capacity]] (heat capacity per unit mass) of a gas. Suffix &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; refer to constant pressure and constant volume conditions respectively.

To understand this relation, consider the following [[thought experiment]].
A closed [[pneumatic cylinder]] contains air. The [[piston]] is locked. The pressure inside is equal to atmospheric pressure. This cylinder is heated to a certain target temperature. Since the piston cannot move, the volume is constant. The temperature and pressure will rise. When the target temperature is reached, the heating is stopped. The amount of energy added equals: &lt;math&gt;C_V \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; representing the change in temperature.  The piston is now freed and moves outwards, stopping as the pressure inside the chamber equilibrates to atmospheric pressure.  We are free to assume the expansion happens fast enough to occur without exchange of heat ([[Adiabatic process|adiabatic expansion]]). Doing this [[Mechanical work|work]], air inside the cylinder will cool to below the target temperature. To return to the target temperature (still with a free piston), the air must be heated, but is no longer under constant volume since the piston is free to move as the gas is reheated. This extra heat amounts to about 40% more than the previous amount added. In this example, the amount of heat added with a locked piston is proportional to &lt;math&gt;C_V &lt;/math&gt;, whereas the total amount of heat added is proportional to &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the heat capacity ratio in this example is 1.4.

Another way of understanding the difference between &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt; is that &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; applies if work is done to the system which causes a change in volume (e.g. by moving a piston so as to compress the contents of a cylinder), or if work is done by the system which changes its temperature (e.g. heating the gas in a cylinder to cause a piston to move). &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt; applies only if &lt;math&gt;P dV&lt;/math&gt; - that is, the work done - is zero. Consider the difference between adding heat to the gas with a locked piston, and adding heat with a piston free to move, so that pressure remains constant. In the second case, the gas will both heat and expand, causing the piston to do mechanical work on the atmosphere. The heat that is added to the gas goes only partly into heating the gas, while the rest is transformed into the mechanical work performed by the piston. In the first, constant-volume case (locked piston) there is no external motion, and thus no mechanical work is done on the atmosphere; &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt; is used. In the second case, additional work is done as the volume changes, so the amount of heat required to raise the gas temperature (the specific heat capacity) is higher for this constant pressure case.

== Ideal gas relations ==

For an ideal gas, the heat capacity is constant with temperature. Accordingly we can express the [[enthalpy]]  as &lt;math&gt;H = C_P T&lt;/math&gt; and the [[internal energy]] as &lt;math&gt;U = C_V T&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, it can also be said that the heat capacity ratio is the ratio between the enthalpy to the internal energy:
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{H}{U}&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the heat capacities can be expressed in terms of heat capacity ratio ( &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; ) and the [[gas constant]] ( &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; ):
:&lt;math&gt; C_P = \frac{\gamma n R}{\gamma - 1} \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad C_V = \frac{n R}{\gamma - 1}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[amount of substance]]  in moles.

It can be rather difficult to find tabulated information for &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; is more commonly tabulated. The following relation, can be used to determine &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;C_V = C_P - nR&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relation with degrees of freedom ===
The heat capacity ratio ( &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; ) for an ideal gas can be related to the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] ( &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; ) of a molecule by:
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma\ = 1 + \frac{2}{f}\qquad \mbox{or} \qquad f = \frac{2}{\gamma-1}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus we observe that for a [[monatomic]] gas, with three degrees of freedom:
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma\ = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67&lt;/math&gt;,
while for a [[diatomic]] gas, with five degrees of freedom (at room temperature: three translational and two rotational degrees of freedom; the vibrational degree of freedom is not involved except at high temperatures):
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4&lt;/math&gt;.

E.g.: The terrestrial air is primarily made up of [[diatomic]] gases (~78% [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and ~21% [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) and at standard conditions it can be considered to be an ideal gas. The above value of 1.4 is highly consistent with the measured adiabatic indices for dry air within a temperature range of 0 to 200&amp;nbsp;°C, exhibiting a deviation of only 0.2% (see tablation above).

== Real gas relations ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
As temperature increases, higher energy rotational and vibrational states become accessible to molecular gases, thus increasing the number of degrees of freedom and lowering &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. 
For a real gas, both &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt; increase with increasing temperature, while continuing to differ from each other by a fixed constant (as above, &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C_V + nR&lt;/math&gt;) which reflects the relatively constant &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; difference in work done during expansion, for constant pressure vs. constant volume conditions. Thus, the ratio of the two values, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, decreases with increasing temperature. For more information on mechanisms for storing heat in gases, see the gas section of [[specific heat capacity]].

== Thermodynamic expressions ==

Values based on approximations (particularly &lt;math&gt;C_P - C_V = nR&lt;/math&gt;) are in many cases not sufficiently accurate for practical engineering calculations such as flow rates through pipes and valves. An experimental value should be used rather than one based on this approximation, where possible. A rigorous value for the ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac{C_P}{C_V}&lt;/math&gt; can also be calculated by determining &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt; from the residual properties expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; C_P - C_V \ = \ -T \frac{{\left( {\frac{\part V}{\part T}} \right)_P^2 }} {\left(\frac{\part V}{\part P}\right)_T} \ = \ -T \frac{{ \left( {\frac{\part P}{\part T}} \right) }_V^2} {\left( \frac{\part P}{\part V} \right)_T} &lt;/math&gt;

Values for &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; are readily available and recorded, but values for &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt; need to be determined via relations such as these. [[Relations between specific heats|See here]] for the derivation of the thermodynamic relations between the heat capacities.

The above definition is the approach used to develop rigorous expressions from equations of state (such as [[Peng–Robinson equation of state|Peng–Robinson]]), which match experimental values so closely that there is little need to develop a database of ratios or &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt; values. Values can also be determined through [[finite difference method|finite difference approximation]].

== Adiabatic process ==
{{see also|Adiabatic process|polytropic process}}
This ratio gives the important relation for an [[isentropic]] ([[Quasistatic process|quasistatic]], [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], [[adiabatic process]]) process of a [[simple compressible]] [[calorically perfect]] [[ideal gas]]:

:&lt;math&gt; PV^\gamma = \text{constant} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35084">{{about|the mobility for electrons and holes in metals and semiconductors|the general concept|Electrical mobility}}

In [[solid-state physics]], the '''electron mobility''' characterizes how quickly an [[electron]] can move through a [[metal]] or [[semiconductor]], when pulled by an [[electric field]]. In semiconductors, there is an analogous quantity for [[Electron hole|holes]], called '''hole mobility'''. The term '''carrier mobility''' refers in general to both electron and hole mobility in semiconductors.

Electron and hole mobility are special cases of [[electrical mobility]] of charged particles in a fluid under an applied electric field.

When an electric field ''E'' is applied across a piece of material, the electrons respond by moving with an average velocity called the [[drift velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\, v_d&lt;/math&gt;. Then the electron mobility μ is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\,v_d = \mu E&lt;/math&gt;.

Electron mobility is almost always specified in units of [[square centimetre|cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]/([[volt|V]]·[[second|s]]). This is different from the [[SI]] unit of mobility, [[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]/([[volt|V]]·[[second|s]]). They are related by 1m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s) = 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s).

[[Electrical conductivity|Conductivity]] is proportional to the product of mobility and carrier concentration. For example, the same conductivity could come from a small number of electrons with high mobility for each, or a large number of electrons with a small mobility for each. For metals, it would not typically matter which of these is the case, since most metal electrical behavior depends on conductivity alone. Therefore mobility is relatively unimportant in metal physics. On the other hand, for semiconductors, the behavior of [[transistor]]s and other devices can be very different depending on whether there are many electrons with low mobility or few electrons with high mobility. Therefore mobility is a very important parameter for semiconductor materials. Almost always, higher mobility leads to better device performance, with other things equal.

Semiconductor mobility depends on the impurity concentrations (including donor and acceptor concentrations), defect concentration, temperature, and electron and hole concentrations. It also depends on the electric field, particularly at high fields when [[velocity saturation]] occurs. It can be determined by the [[Hall effect]], or inferred from transistor behavior.

==Introduction==

===Drift velocity in an electric field===
{{main|Drift velocity}}
Without any applied electric field, in a solid, [[electrons]] (or, in the case of [[semiconductors]], both [[electrons]] and [[electron hole|holes]]) [[Brownian motion|move around randomly]]. Therefore, on average there will be no overall motion of charge carriers in any particular direction over time.

However, when an electric field is applied, each electron is accelerated by the electric field. If the electron were in a vacuum, it would be accelerated to faster and faster velocities (called [[ballistic transport]]). However, in a solid, the electron repeatedly scatters off [[Crystallographic defect|crystal defects]], [[phonons]], impurities, etc. Therefore, it does not accelerate faster and faster; instead it moves with a finite average velocity, called the [[drift velocity]]. This net electron motion is usually much slower than the normally occurring random motion.

In a semiconductor the two charge carriers, electrons and [[Electron hole|holes]], will typically have different drift velocities for the same electric field.

Quasi-[[ballistic transport]] is possible in solids if the electrons are accelerated across a very small distance (as small as the [[mean free path]]), or for a very short time (as short as the [[mean free time]]). In these cases, drift velocity and mobility are not meaningful.

===Definition and units===
{{see also|Electrical mobility}}
The electron mobility is defined by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\,v_d = \mu E&lt;/math&gt;.
where:
:''E'' is the [[Euclidean vector|magnitude]] of the [[electric field]] applied to a material,
:''v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Euclidean vector|magnitude]] of the electron drift velocity (in other words, the electron drift [[speed]]) caused by the electric field, and
:µ is the electron mobility.
The hole mobility is defined by the same equation. Both electron and hole mobilities are positive by definition.

Usually, the electron drift velocity in a material is directly proportional to the electric field, which means that the electron mobility is a constant (independent of electric field). When this is not true (for example, in very large electric fields), the mobility depends on the electric field.

The SI unit of velocity is [[Metre per second|m/s]], and the SI unit of electric field is [[volt|V]]/[[metre|m]]. Therefore the SI unit of mobility is (m/s)/(V/m) = [[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]/([[volt|V]]·[[second|s]]). However, mobility is much more commonly expressed in cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s).

Mobility is usually a strong function of material impurities and temperature, and is determined empirically. Mobility values are typically presented in table or chart form. Mobility is also different for electrons and holes in a given [[semiconductor]].

===Relation to conductivity===
There is a simple relation between mobility and [[electrical conductivity]]. Let ''n'' be the [[number density]] (concentration) of electrons, and let μ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; be their mobility. In the electric field '''E''', each of these electrons will move with the velocity vector &lt;math&gt;-\mu_e \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;, for a total current density of &lt;math&gt;n e \mu_e \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; (where ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]]). Therefore, the electrical conductivity σ satisfies:&lt;ref name=BVZ&gt;[http://ece-www.colorado.edu/~bart/book/book/chapter2/ch2_7.htm Chapter 2: Semiconductor Fundamentals]. Online textbook by B. Van Zeghbroeck]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=ne\mu_e&lt;/math&gt;.
This formula is valid when the conductivity is due entirely to electrons. In a [[p-type semiconductor]], the conductivity is due to holes instead, but the formula is essentially the same: If ''p'' is the concentration of holes and μ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is the hole mobility, then the conductivity is

==Examples==
Typical electron mobility for [[Silicon|Si]] at room temperature (300 K) is 1400&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ (V·s) and the hole mobility is around 450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ (V·s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/SVA/NSM/Semicond/Si/electric.html Electrical properties of silicon], Ioffe Institute Database&lt;/ref&gt;

Very high mobility has been found in several low-dimensional systems, such as two-dimensional electron gases ([[2DEG]]) (35,000,000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s) at low temperature),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Umansky|first1=V.|last2=Heiblum|first2=M.|last3=Levinson|first3=Y.|last4=Smet|first4=J.|last5=Nübler|first5=J.|last6=Dolev|first6=M.|title=MBE growth of ultra-low disorder 2DEG with mobility exceeding 35×106 cm2 V−1 s−1|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|volume=311|pages=1658–1661|year=2009|bibcode = 2009JCrGr.311.1658U |doi = 10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2008.09.151 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[carbon nanotubes]] (100,000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s) at room temperature) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dürkop|first1=T.|last2=Getty|first2=S.

Organic semiconductors ([[polymer]], [[oligomer]]) developed thus far have carrier mobilities below 50&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V·s), and usually much lower.

==Electric field dependence and velocity saturation==
{{main|Velocity saturation}}

At low fields, the drift velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; is proportional to the electric field ''E'', so mobility ''μ'' is constant. This value of ''μ'' is called the ''low-field mobility''.

As the electric field is increased, however, the carrier velocity increases sublinearly and asymptotically towards a maximum possible value, called the ''saturation velocity'' ''v''&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, the value of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; is on the order of 1×10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cm/s for both electrons and holes in Si. It is on the order of 6×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cm/s for Ge. This velocity is a characteristic of the material and a strong function of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or impurity levels and temperature. It is one of the key material and semiconductor device properties that determine a device such as a transistor's ultimate limit of speed of response and frequency.

This velocity saturation phenomenon results from a process called ''[[optical phonon]] scattering''. At high fields, carriers are accelerated enough to gain sufficient [[kinetic energy]] between collisions to emit an optical phonon, and they do so very quickly, before being accelerated once again. The velocity that the electron reaches before emitting a phonon is:
:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{m^*v_{emit}^2}{2} \approx \hbar \omega_{phonon (opt.)}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ω&lt;sub&gt;phonon(opt.)&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the optical-phonon angular frequency and m* the carrier effective mass in the direction of the electric field. The value of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;phonon (opt.)&lt;/sub&gt; is 0.063 eV for Si and 0.034 eV for GaAs and Ge. The saturation velocity is only one-half of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;emit&lt;/sub&gt;, because the electron starts at zero velocity and accelerates up to ''v''&lt;sub&gt;emit&lt;/sub&gt; in each cycle.&lt;ref name=Mitin&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vladimir Vasilʹevich Mitin|author2=Vi︠a︡cheslav Aleksandrovich Kochelap|author3=Michael A. Stroscio|title=Quantum heterostructures: microelectronics and optoelectronics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wzo4IdxS48oC&amp;pg=PA308|accessdate=2 March 2011|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63635-3|pages=307–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is a somewhat oversimplified description.&lt;ref name=Mitin/&gt;)

Velocity saturation is not the only possible high-field behavior. Another is the [[Gunn effect]], where a sufficiently high electric field can cause intervalley electron transfer, which reduces drift velocity. This is unusual; increasing the electric field almost always ''increases'' the drift velocity, or else leaves it unchanged. The result is [[negative differential resistance]].

In the regime of velocity saturation (or other high-field effects), mobility is a strong function of electric field. This means that mobility is a somewhat less useful concept, compared to simply discussing drift velocity directly.

==Relation between scattering and mobility==
Recall that by definition, mobility is dependent on the drift velocity. The main factor determining drift velocity (other than [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]) is [[scattering]] time, i.e. how long the carrier is [[ballistic transport|ballistically accelerated]] by the electric field until it scatters (collides) with something that changes its direction and/or energy. The most important sources of scattering in typical semiconductor materials, discussed below, are ionized impurity scattering and acoustic phonon scattering (also called lattice scattering). In some cases other sources of scattering may be important, such as neutral impurity scattering, optical phonon scattering, surface scattering, and [[crystallographic defect|defect]] scattering.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite book|author=Singh|title=Electronic Devices And Integrated Circuits|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2aqtlybkFE0C&amp;pg=PA77|accessdate=1 March 2011|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-3192-1|pages=77–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elastic scattering means that energy is (almost) conserved during the scattering event. Some elastic scattering processes are scattering from acoustic phonons, impurity scattering, piezoelectric scattering, etc. In acoustic phonon scattering, electrons scatter from state '''k''' to''' k'''', while emitting or absorbing a phonon of wave vector '''q'''. This phenomenon is usually modeled by assuming that lattice vibrations cause small shifts in energy bands. The additional potential causing the scattering process is generated by the deviations of bands due to these small transitions from frozen lattice positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;sct&quot;&gt;Ferry, David K. Semiconductor transport. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000. ISBN 0-7484-0865-7 (hbk.), ISBN 0-7484-0866-5 (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ionized impurity scattering===
Semiconductors are doped with donors and/or acceptors, which are typically ionized, and are thus charged. The Coulombic forces will deflect an electron or hole approaching the ionized impurity. This is known as ''[[ionized impurity scattering]]''. The amount of deflection depends on the speed of the carrier and its proximity to the ion. The more heavily a material is doped, the higher the probability that a carrier will collide with an ion in a given time, and the smaller the [[mean free time]] between collisions, and the smaller the mobility. When determining the strength of these interactions due to the long-range nature of the Coulomb potential, other impurities and free carriers cause the range of interaction with the carriers to reduce significantly compared to bare Coulomb interaction.

If these scatterers are near the interface, the complexity of the problem increases due to the existence of crystal defects and disorders. Charge trapping centers that scatter free carriers form in many cases due to defects associated with dangling bonds. Scattering happens because after trapping a charge, the defect becomes charged and therefore starts interacting with free carriers. If scattered carriers are in the inversion layer at the interface, the reduced dimensionality of the carriers makes the case differ from the case of bulk impurity scattering as carriers move only in two dimensions. Interfacial roughness also causes short-range scattering limiting the mobility of quasi-two-dimensional electrons at the interface.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;

===Lattice (phonon) scattering===
At any temperature above [[absolute zero]], the vibrating atoms create pressure (acoustic) waves in the crystal, which are termed [[phonon]]s. Like electrons, phonons can be considered to be particles. A phonon can interact (collide) with an electron (or hole) and scatter it. At higher temperature, there are more phonons, and thus increased phonon scattering, which tends to reduce mobility.

===Piezoelectric scattering===
Piezoelectric effect can occur only in compound semiconductor due to their polar nature. It is small in most semiconductors but may lead to local electric fields that cause scattering of carriers by deflecting them, this effect is important mainly at low temperatures where other scattering mechanisms are weak. These electric fields arise from the distortion of the basic unit cell as strain is applied in certain directions in the lattice.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;

===Surface roughness scattering===
Surface roughness scattering caused by interfacial disorder is short range scattering limiting the mobility of quasi-two-dimensional electrons at the interface. From high-resolution transmission electron micrographs, it has been determined that the interface is not abrupt on the atomic level, but actual position of the interfacial plane varies one or two atomic layers along the surface. These variations are random and cause fluctuations of the energy levels at the interface, which then causes scattering.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;

===Alloy scattering===
In compound (alloy) semiconductors, which many thermoelectric materials are, scattering caused by the perturbation of crystal potential due to the random positioning of substituting atom species in a relevant sublattice is known as alloy scattering. This can only happen in ternary or higher alloys as their crystal structure forms by randomly replacing some atoms in one of the sublattices (sublattice) of the crystal structure. Generally, this phenomenon is quite weak but in certain materials or circumstances, it can become dominant effect limiting conductivity. In bulk materials, interface scattering is usually ignored.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ssp&quot;&gt;Ibach, Harald. ; Luth, Hans.

===Inelastic scattering===
During inelastic scattering processes, significant energy exchange happens. As with elastic phonon scattering also in the inelastic case, the potential arises from energy band deformations caused by atomic vibrations. Optical phonons causing inelastic scattering usually have the energy in the range 30-50 meV, for comparison energies of acoustic phonon are typically less than 1 meV but some might have energy in order of 10 meV. There is significant change in carrier energy during the scattering process. Optical or high-energy acoustic phonons can also cause intervalley or interband scattering, which means that scattering is not limited within single valley.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;

===Electron–electron scattering===
Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, electrons can be considered as non-interacting if their density does not exceed the value 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; or electric field value 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; V/cm. However, significantly above these limits electron–electron scattering starts to dominate. Long range and nonlinearity of the Coulomb potential governing interactions between electrons make these interactions difficult to deal with.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt;&lt;ref name=bulusu /&gt;

===Relation between mobility and scattering time===
A simple model gives the approximate relation between scattering time (average time between scattering events) and mobility. It is assumed that after each scattering event, the carrier's motion is randomized, so it has zero average velocity. After that, it accelerates uniformly in the electric field, until it scatters again. The resulting average drift mobility is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Y. Yu|author2=Manuel Cardona|title=Fundamentals of Semiconductors: Physics and Materials Properties|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5aBuKYBT_hsC&amp;pg=PA205+|accessdate=1 March 2011|date=30 May 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-00709-5|pages=205–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{q}{m^*}\overline{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''q'' is the [[elementary charge]], m* is the carrier [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]], and {{overline|τ}} is the average scattering time.

If the effective mass is anisotropic (direction-dependent), m* is the effective mass in the direction of the electric field.

===Matthiessen's rule===
Normally, more than one source of scattering is present, for example both impurities and lattice phonons. It is normally a very good approximation to combine their influences using &quot;Matthiessen's Rule&quot; (developed from work by [[Augustus Matthiessen]] in 1864):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{\mu_{\rm impurities}} + \frac{1}{\mu_{\rm lattice}}&lt;/math&gt;.
where µ is the actual mobility, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\rm impurities}&lt;/math&gt; is the mobility that the material would have if there was impurity scattering but no other source of scattering, and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\rm lattice}&lt;/math&gt; is the mobility that the material would have if there was lattice phonon scattering but no other source of scattering. Other terms may be added for other scattering sources, for example
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{\mu_{\rm impurities}} + \frac{1}{\mu_{\rm lattice}} + \frac{1}{\mu_{\rm defects}} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;.
Matthiessen's rule can also be stated in terms of the scattering time:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{1}{\tau_{\rm impurities}} + \frac{1}{\tau_{\rm lattice}} + \frac{1}{\tau_{\rm defects}} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;.
where ''τ'' is the true average scattering time and τ&lt;sub&gt;impurities&lt;/sub&gt; is the scattering time if there was impurity scattering but no other source of scattering, etc.

Matthiessen's rule is an approximation and is not universally valid. This rule is not valid if the factors affecting the mobility depend on each other, because individual scattering probabilities cannot be summed unless they are independent of each other.&lt;ref name=Takeda/&gt;  The average free time of flight of a carrier and therefore the relaxation time is inversely proportional to the scattering probability.&lt;ref name=sct /&gt;&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt;&lt;ref name=pallab /&gt; For example, lattice scattering alters the average electron velocity (in the electric-field direction), which in turn alters the tendency to scatter off impurities. There are more complicated formulas that attempt to take these effects into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Antonio Luque|author2=Steven Hegedus|title=Handbook of photovoltaic science and engineering|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u-bCMhl_JjQC|accessdate=2 March 2011|date=9 June 2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-49196-5|page=79, eq. 3.58}} [http://www.knovel.com/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=1081 weblink (subscription only)]&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing temperature, phonon concentration increases and causes increased scattering. Thus lattice scattering lowers the carrier mobility more and more at higher temperature. Theoretical calculations reveal that the mobility in [[Chemical polarity|non-polar]] semiconductors, such as silicon and germanium, is dominated by [[Phonon|acoustic phonon]] interaction. The resulting mobility is expected to be proportional to ''T''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;−3/2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the mobility due to optical phonon scattering only is expected to be proportional to ''T''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. Experimentally, values of the temperature dependence of the mobility in Si, Ge and GaAs are listed in table.&lt;ref name=BVZ/&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\tau }\propto \left \langle v\right \rangle\Sigma &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the scattering cross section for electrons and holes at a scattering center and &lt;math&gt;\left \langle v\right \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a thermal average (Boltzmann statistics) over all electron or hole velocities in the lower conduction band or upper valence band, temperature dependence of the mobility can be determined. In here, the following definition for the scattering cross section is used: number of particles scattered into solid angle dΩ per unit time divided by number of particles per area per time (incident intensity), which comes from classical mechanics. As Boltzmann statistics are valid for semiconductors 
&lt;math&gt;\left \langle v\right \rangle\sim\sqrt{T}&lt;/math&gt;.

For scattering from acoustic phonons, for temperatures well above Debye temperature, the estimated cross section Σ&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt; is determined from the square of the average vibrational amplitude of a phonon to be proportional to T. The scattering from charged defects (ionized donors or acceptors) leads to the cross section &lt;math&gt;{\Sigma }_{def}\propto {\left \langle v\right \rangle}^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;. This formula is the scattering cross section for &quot;Rutherford scattering&quot;, where a point charge (carrier) moves past another point charge (defect) experiencing Coulomb interaction.

The temperature dependencies of these two scattering mechanism in semiconductors can be determined by combining formulas for τ, Σ and &lt;math&gt;\left \langle v\right \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, to be for scattering from acoustic phonons 
&lt;math&gt;{\mu }_{ph}\sim T^{-3/2}&lt;/math&gt; and from charged defects &lt;math&gt;{\mu }_{def}\sim T^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt;&lt;ref name=pallab /&gt;

The effect of ionized impurity scattering, however, ''decreases'' with increasing temperature because the average thermal speeds of the carriers are increase.&lt;ref name=Singh/&gt; Thus, the carriers spend less time near an ionized impurity as they pass and the scattering effect of the ions is thus reduced.

These two effects operate simultaneously on the carriers through Matthiessen's rule. At lower temperatures, ionized impurity scattering dominates, while at higher temperatures, phonon scattering dominates, and the actual mobility reaches a maximum at an intermediate temperature.

==Measurement of semiconductor mobility==

===Hall mobility===
{{Main|Hall effect}}

[[File:Hall Effect Measurement Setup for Holes.png|right|frame|Hall effect measurement setup for holes]]
[[File:Hall Effect Measurement Setup for Electrons.png|right|frame|Hall effect measurement setup for electrons]]

Carrier mobility is most commonly measured using the [[Hall effect]]. The result of the measurement is called the &quot;Hall mobility&quot; (meaning &quot;mobility inferred from a Hall-effect measurement&quot;).

Consider a semiconductor sample with a rectangular cross section as shown in the figures, a current is flowing in the ''x''-direction and a [[magnetic field]] is applied in the ''z''-direction. The resulting Lorentz force will accelerate the electrons (''n''-type materials) or holes (''p''-type materials) in the (−''y'') direction, according to the right hand rule and set up an electric field ''ξ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''. As a result there is a voltage across the sample, which can be measured with a [[High impedance|high-impedance]] voltmeter. This voltage, ''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'', is called the [[Hall effect|Hall voltage]]. ''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' is negative for ''n''-type material and positive for ''p''-type material.

Mathematically, the [[Lorentz force]] acting on a charge ''q'' is given by

For electrons:
:::&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Hn} = -q(\overrightarrow{v}_n \times \overrightarrow{B}_z)&lt;/math&gt;

For holes:
:::&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_{Hp} = +q(\overrightarrow{v}_p \times \overrightarrow{B}_z)&lt;/math&gt;

In steady state this force is balanced by the force set up by the Hall voltage, so that there is no [[net force]] on the carriers in the ''y'' direction. For electron,

:::&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F}_y = (-q)\overrightarrow{\xi}_y + (-q)[\overrightarrow{v}_n \times \overrightarrow{B}_z] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow -q\xi_y + qv_xB_z = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; \xi_y = v_xB_z&lt;/math&gt;

For electrons, the field points in the -''y'' direction, and for holes, it points in the +''y'' direction.

The [[Electric current|electron current]] ''I'' is given by &lt;math&gt;I = -qnv_xtW&lt;/math&gt;. Sub ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; into the expression for ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;,

:::&lt;math&gt;\xi_y = -\frac{IB}{nqtW} = +\frac{R_{Hn}IB}{tW}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;Hn&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the Hall coefficient for electron, and is defined as
:::&lt;math&gt;R_{Hn} = -\frac{1}{nq}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\xi_y = \frac{V_H}{W}&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;R_{Hn} = -\frac{1}{nq} = \frac{V_{Hn}t}{IB}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for holes
:::&lt;math&gt;R_{Hp} = \frac{1}{pq} = \frac{V_{Hp}t}{IB}&lt;/math&gt;

From the Hall coefficient, we can obtain the carrier mobility as follows:
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_n = (-nq)\mu_n(-\frac{1}{nq}) = -\sigma_n R_{Hn}&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;= -\frac{\sigma_n V_{Hn}t}{IB}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly,
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_p = \frac{\sigma_p V_{Hp}t}{IB}&lt;/math&gt;

Here the value of ''V&lt;sub&gt;Hp&lt;/sub&gt; (Hall voltage), t (sample thickness), I (current) and B (magnetic field)'' can be measured directly, and the conductivities σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; or σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; are either known or can be obtained from measuring the resistivity.

===Field-effect mobility===
{{See also|MOSFET}}
{{Distinguish|Wien effect}}
The mobility can also be measured using a [[field-effect transistor]] (FET). The result of the measurement is called the &quot;field-effect mobility&quot; (meaning &quot;mobility inferred from a field-effect measurement&quot;).

The measurement can work in two ways: From saturation-mode measurements, or linear-region measurements.&lt;ref name=Rost&gt;{{cite book|author=Constance Rost-Bietsch|title=Ambipolar and Light-Emitting Organic Field-Effect Transistors|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xxvt0CkVKaIC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=1 March 2011|date=August 2005|publisher=Cuvillier Verlag|isbn=978-3-86537-535-3|pages=17–}}. This reference mistakenly leaves out a factor of 1/V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt; in eqn (2.11). The correct version of that equation can be found, e.g., in {{cite journal|last1=Stassen|first1=A. F.|last2=De Boer|first2=R. W. I.|last3=Iosad|first3=N. N.|last4=Morpurgo|first4=A. F.|title=Influence of the gate dielectric on the mobility of rubrene single-crystal field-effect transistors|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=85|pages=3899|year=2004|doi=10.1063/1.1812368|arxiv = cond-mat/0407293 |bibcode = 2004ApPhL..85.3899S }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[MOSFET]] for a description of the different modes or regions of operation.)

====Using saturation mode====
In this technique,&lt;ref name=Rost/&gt; for each fixed gate voltage V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt;, the drain-source voltage V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt; is increased until the current I&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; saturates. Next, the square root of this saturated current is plotted against the gate voltage, and the slope m&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; is measured. Then the mobility is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = m_{sat}^2 \frac{2L}{W} \frac{1}{C_i}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L'' and ''W'' are the length and width of the channel and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the gate insulator capacitance per unit area. This equation comes from the approximate equation for a MOSFET in saturation mode:
:&lt;math&gt;I_D = \frac{\mu C_i}{2}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS}-V_{th})^2.&lt;/math&gt;
where V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; is the threshold voltage. This approximation ignores the [[Early effect]] (channel length modulation), among other things. In practice, this technique may underestimate the true mobility.&lt;ref name=Rost2&gt;{{cite book|author=Constance Rost-Bietsch|title=Ambipolar and Light-Emitting Organic Field-Effect Transistors|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xxvt0CkVKaIC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=20 April 2011|date=August 2005|publisher=Cuvillier Verlag|isbn=978-3-86537-535-3|pages=19–}} &quot;Extracting the field-effect mobility directly from the linear region of the output characteristic may yield larger values for the field-effect mobility than the actual one, since the drain current is linear only for very small VDS and large VG. In contrast, extracting the field-effect mobility from the saturated region might yield rather conservative values for the field-effect mobility, since the drain-current dependence from the gate-voltage becomes sub-quadratic for large VG as well as for small VDS.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Using the linear region====
In this technique,&lt;ref name=Rost/&gt; the transistor is operated in the linear region (or &quot;ohmic mode&quot;), where V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt; is small and &lt;math&gt;I_D \propto V_{GS}&lt;/math&gt; with slope m&lt;sub&gt;lin&lt;/sub&gt;. Then the mobility is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = m_{lin} \frac{L}{W} \frac{1}{V_{DS}} \frac{1}{C_i}&lt;/math&gt;.
This equation comes from the approximate equation for a MOSFET in the linear region:
:&lt;math&gt;I_D= \mu C_i \frac{W}{L} \left( (V_{GS}-V_{th})V_{DS}-\frac{V_{DS}^2}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
In practice, this technique may overestimate the true mobility, because if V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt; is not small enough and V&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is not large enough, the MOSFET may not stay in the linear region.&lt;ref name=Rost2/&gt;

==Doping concentration dependence in heavily-doped silicon==
The [[charge carrier]]s in semiconductors are electrons and holes. Their numbers are controlled by the concentrations of impurity elements, i.e. doping concentration. Thus doping concentration has great influence on carrier mobility.

While there is considerable scatter in the [[experimental data]], for noncompensated material (no counter doping) for heavily doped substrates (i.e. &lt;math&gt;10^{18}\mathrm{cm}^{-3} &lt;/math&gt; and up), the mobility in silicon is often characterized by the [[empirical relationship]]:&lt;ref&gt;B. L. Anderson and R. L. Anderson, &quot;Fundamentals of Semiconductor Devices, &quot; Mc Graw Hill, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu_o + \frac{\mu_1}{1+(\frac{N}{N_\text{ref}})^\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the doping concentration (either ''N&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''), and ''N&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;'' and α are fitting parameters. At [[room temperature]], the above equation becomes:

Majority carriers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caughey|first1=D.M.|last2=Thomas|first2=R.E.|title=Carrier mobilities in silicon empirically related to doping and field|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=55|pages=2192|year=1967|doi=10.1109/PROC.1967.6123}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_n(N_D) = 65 + \frac{1265}{1+(\frac{N_D}{8.5\times10^{16}})^{0.72}}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_p(N_A) = 48 + \frac{447}{1+(\frac{N_A}{6.3\times10^{16}})^{0.76}}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_n(N_A) = 232 + \frac{1180}{1+(\frac{N_A}{8\times10^{16}})^{0.9}}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_p(N_D) = 130 + \frac{370}{1+(\frac{N_D}{8\times10^{17}})^{1.25}}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations apply only to silicon, and only under low field.

{{see also|Vapor quality}}

In [[Green's function (many-body theory)|response theory]], the '''quality''' of an excited system is related to the number of [[excitation frequencies]] to which it can respond. In the case of a homogeneous, [[isotropic]] system, the quality is proportional to the [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]].

This sense of the phrase is the precursor of the usage of the word in [[music theory]]. In music theory, quality is the number of [[harmonics]] of a [[fundamental frequency]] of an [[musical instrument|instrument]] (the higher the quality, the richer the [[sound]]).

{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[List of thermodynamic properties|System properties]]}}
In [[thermodynamics]], the '''volume''' of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is an important [[extensive parameter]] for describing its [[thermodynamic state]]. The '''specific volume''', an [[intensive property]], is the system's volume per unit of mass. Volume is a [[function of state]] and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]]. For example, volume is related to the [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] of an [[ideal gas]] by the [[ideal gas law]].

The physical volume of a system may or may not coincide with a [[control volume]] used to analyze the system.

==Overview==
The volume of a thermodynamic system typically refers to the volume of the working fluid, such as, for example, the fluid within a piston. Changes to this volume may be made through an application of [[work (thermodynamics)|work]], or may be used to produce work.  An [[isochoric process]] however operates at a constant-volume, thus no work can be produced. Many other [[thermodynamic process]]es will result in a change in volume. A [[polytropic process]], in particular, causes changes to the system so that the quantity &lt;math&gt;pV^n&lt;/math&gt; is constant (where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is pressure, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is volume, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[polytropic index]], a constant). Note that for specific polytropic indexes a polytropic process will be equivalent to a constant-property process. For instance, for very large values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; approaching infinity, the process becomes constant-volume.

Gases are [[compressible]], thus their volumes (and specific volumes) may be subject to change during thermodynamic processes. Liquids, however, are nearly incompressible, thus their volumes can be often taken as constant. In general, [[compressibility]] is defined as the relative volume change of a fluid or solid as a response to a pressure, and may be determined for substances in any phase. Similarly, [[thermal expansion]] is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature.

Many [[thermodynamic cycle]]s are made up of varying processes, some which maintain a constant volume and some which do not. A [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle, for example, follows a sequence where the refrigerant fluid transitions between the liquid and vapor [[states of matter]].

Typical units for volume are &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{m^3}&lt;/math&gt; (cubic [[meter]]s), &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{l}&lt;/math&gt; ([[liter]]s), and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ft}^3&lt;/math&gt; (cubic [[foot (unit)|feet]]).

==Heat and work==
Mechanical work performed on a working fluid causes a change in the mechanical constraints of the system; in other words, for work to occur, the volume must be altered.  Hence volume is an important parameter in characterizing many thermodynamic processes where an exchange of energy in the form of work is involved.

Volume is one of a pair of [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate variable]]s, the other being pressure.  As with all conjugate pairs, the product is a form of energy.  The product &lt;math&gt;pV&lt;/math&gt; is the energy lost to a system due to mechanical work.  This product is one term which makes up [[enthalpy]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;H = U + pV,\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the [[internal energy]] of the system.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] describes constraints on the amount of useful work which can be extracted from a thermodynamic system. In thermodynamic systems where the temperature and volume are held constant, the measure of &quot;useful&quot; work attainable is the [[Helmholtz free energy]]; and in systems where the volume is not held constant, the measure of useful work attainable is the [[Gibbs free energy]].

Similarly, the appropriate value of [[heat capacity]] to use in a given process depends on whether the process produces a change in volume. The heat capacity is a function of the amount of heat added to a system.  In the case of a constant-volume process, all the heat affects the [[internal energy]] of the system (i.e., there is no pV-work, and all the heat affects the temperature). However in a process without a constant volume, the heat addition affects both the internal energy and the work (i.e., the enthalpy); thus the temperature changes by a different amount than in the constant-volume case and a different heat capacity value is required.

==Specific volume==
{{see also|Specific volume#Specific volume|l1=Specific volume}}
[[Specific volume]] (&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;) is the volume occupied by a unit of mass of a material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Cengel | first1 = Yunus A. | last2 = Boles | first2 = Michael A. | title = Thermodynamics: an engineering approach | year = 2002 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = Boston  | isbn  = 0-07-238332-1 | pages =    11}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases the specific volume is a useful quantity to determine because, as an intensive property, it can be used to determine the complete state of a system in conjunction with [[state postulate|another independent intensive variable]]. The specific volume also allows systems to be studied without reference to an exact operating volume, which may not be known (nor significant) at some stages of analysis.

The specific volume of a substance is equal to the reciprocal of its [[mass density]]. Specific volume may be expressed in &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{m^3}}{\mathrm{kg}} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{ft^3}}{\mathrm{lbm}} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{ft^3}}{\mathrm{slug}} &lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{mL}}{\mathrm{g}} &lt;/math&gt; .
:&lt;math&gt; \nu = \frac{V}{m} = \frac{1}{\rho} &lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the material.

For an [[ideal gas]],
:&lt;math&gt;\nu = \frac{{\bar{R}}  T}{P}&lt;/math&gt;
where, &lt;math&gt;{\bar{R}} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific gas constant]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure of the gas.

Specific volume may also refer to [[molar volume]].

==Gas volume==

===Dependence on pressure and temperature===
The volume of gas increases proportionally to [[absolute temperature]] and decreases inversely proportionally to [[pressure]], approximately according to the [[ideal gas law]]:

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{nRT}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:* ''p'' is the pressure
:* ''V'' is the volume
:* ''n'' is the [[amount of substance]] of gas (moles)
:* ''R'' is the [[gas constant]], 8.314 [[joule|J]]·[[kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[[mole (unit)|mol]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
:* ''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]]

To simplify, a volume of gas may be expressed as the volume it would have in [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]], which are 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 100 kPa.&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= A. D. McNaught, A. Wilkinson |title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology, The Gold Book |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/goldbook/S05910.html |edition=2nd |year=1997 |publisher=Blackwell Science |isbn=0-86542-684-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humidity exclusion ===
In contrast to other gas components, water content in air, or [[humidity]], to a higher degree depends on vaporization and condensation from or into water, which, in turn, mainly depends on temperature. Therefore, when applying more pressure to a gas saturated with water, all components will initially decrease in volume approximately according to the ideal gas law. However, some of the water will condense until returning to almost the same humidity as before, giving the resulting total volume deviating from what the ideal gas law predicted. Conversely, decreasing temperature would also make some water condense, again making the final volume deviating from predicted by the ideal gas law.

Therefore, gas volume may alternatively be expressed excluding the humidity content: ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; (volume dry). This fraction more accurately follows the ideal gas law. On the contrary ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (volume saturated) is the volume a gas mixture would have if humidity was added to it until saturation (or 100% [[relative humidity]]).

=== General conversion ===
To compare gas volume between two conditions of different temperature or pressure (1 and 2), assuming nR are the same, the following equation uses humidity exclusion in addition to the ideal gas law:

&lt;math&gt; V_2 = V_1 \times \frac{T_2}{T_1} \times \frac{p_1-p_{w,1}}{p_2-p_{w,2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, in addition to terms used in the ideal gas law:
:* ''p&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the partial pressure of gaseous water during condition 1 and 2, respectively

For example, calculating how much 1 liter of air (a) at 0&amp;nbsp;°C, 100 kPa, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 kPa (known as STPD, see below) would fill when breathed into the lungs where it is mixed with water vapor (l), where it quickly becomes 37&amp;nbsp;°C, 100 kPa, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.2 kPa (BTPS):

&lt;math&gt; V_{l} = 1\ \mathrm{l} \times \frac{310\ \mathrm{K}}{273\ \mathrm{K}} \times \frac{100\ \mathrm{kPa}-0\ \mathrm{kPa}}{100\ \mathrm{kPa}-6.2\ \mathrm{kPa}} = 1.21\ \mathrm{l} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Common conditions ===
Some common expressions of gas volume with defined or variable temperature, pressure and humidity inclusion are:
*'''ATPS''': Ambient temperature (variable) and pressure (variable), saturated (humidity depends on temperature)
*'''ATPD''': Ambient temperature (variable) and pressure (variable), dry (no humidity)
*'''BTPS''': Body Temperature (37&amp;nbsp;°C or 310 K) and pressure (generally same as ambient), saturated (47 mmHg or 6.2 kPa)
*'''STPD''': [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure|Standard temperature (0 °C or 273 K) and pressure ({{convert|760|mmHg|kPa|2|abbr=on}} or {{convert|100|kPa|mmHg|2|abbr=on}}&lt;!--was written as if they were the same, but they are not--&gt;)]], dry (no humidity)

===Conversion factors===
The following conversion factors can be used to convert between expressions for volume of a gas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Stanley|title=Exercise Physiology: Basis of Human Movement in Health and Disease|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=0-7817-3592-0|page=113|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1b0iwv8-jGcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA113,M1 |author2=Miller, Wayne |author3=Eason, M|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial volume===

The partial volume of a particular gas is the volume which the gas would have if it alone occupied the volume, with unchanged pressure and temperature, and is useful in gas mixtures, e.g. air, to focus on one particular gas component, e.g. oxygen.

It can be approximated both from partial pressure and molar fraction:&lt;ref name=biophysics200&gt;Page   200 in: Medical biophysics. Flemming Cornelius. 6th Edition, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''bulk modulus'' (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;) of a substance measures the substance's resistance to uniform compression. It is defined as the ratio of the [[infinitesimal]] [[pressure]] increase to the resulting ''relative'' decrease of the [[volume]]. Its [[International System of Units|SI]] unit is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]], and its [[dimensional analysis|dimensional form]] is M&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/permot3.html|title= Bulk Elastic Properties|work=hyperphysics|publisher=Georgia State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The bulk modulus &lt;math&gt;K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; can be formally defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;K=-V\frac{\mathrm d P}{\mathrm d V}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is pressure, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is volume, and &lt;math&gt;dP/dV&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[derivative]] of pressure with respect to volume.  Equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;K=\rho \frac{\mathrm d P}{\mathrm d \rho}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is [[density]] and d''P''/d''ρ'' denotes the derivative of pressure with respect to density. The inverse of the bulk modulus gives a substance's [[compressibility]].

Other moduli describe the material's response ([[Strain (materials science)|strain]]) to other kinds of [[Stress (physics)|stress]]: the [[shear modulus]] describes the response to shear, and [[Young's modulus]] describes the response to linear stress.  For a [[fluid]], only the bulk modulus is meaningful.  For an [[anisotropic]] solid such as [[wood]] or [[paper]], these three moduli do not contain enough information to describe its behaviour, and one must use the full generalized [[Hooke's law]].

==Thermodynamic relation==
Strictly speaking, the bulk modulus is a [[thermodynamic]] quantity, and in order to specify a bulk modulus it is necessary to specify how the temperature varies during compression: constant-[[temperature]] (isothermal &lt;math&gt;K_T&lt;/math&gt;), constant-[[entropy]] ([[isentropic process|isentropic]] &lt;math&gt;K_S&lt;/math&gt;), and other variations are possible. Such distinctions are especially relevant for [[gas]]es.

For an [[ideal gas]], the isentropic bulk modulus &lt;math&gt;K_S&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
K_S=\gamma\, p
&lt;/math&gt;

and the isothermal bulk modulus &lt;math&gt;K_T&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;K_T = p &lt;/math&gt;

where 
:''&amp;gamma;'' is the [[heat capacity ratio]]
:''p'' is the pressure.

When the gas is not ideal, these equations give only an approximation of the bulk modulus.  In a fluid, the bulk modulus ''K'' and the [[density]] ''ρ'' determine the [[speed of sound]] ''c'' ([[P-wave|pressure waves]]), according to the Newton-Laplace formula
:&lt;math&gt;c=\sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In solids, &lt;math&gt;K_S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_T&lt;/math&gt; have very similar values.
Solids can also sustain [[transverse waves]]: for these materials one additional [[elastic modulus]], for example the shear modulus, is needed to determine wave speeds.

== Measurement ==
It is possible to measure the bulk modulus using  [[Powder diffraction#Expansion tensors.2C bulk modulus|powder diffraction]] under applied pressure.
It is a property of a fluid which shows its ability to change its volume under its pressure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7366">The '''thermomass theory''', proposed by Prof. Zeng-Yuan Guo,&lt;ref&gt;Guo, Z.Y., 2006, &quot;Motion and transfer of thermal mass-Thermal mass and thermon gas,&quot; Journal of Engineering Thermophysics 27(4), 631-634&lt;/ref&gt; regards heat owning the mass-energy duality, which exhibits energy-like features in conversion processes or mass-like characteristics in transfer processes.

'''Thermomass''' is defined as the equivalent mass of the thermal energy in heat transfer, which is determined by the Einstein’s [[mass-energy equivalence]]. The mass of heat therefore leads to the “inertia” and “weight” of heat in heat transfer. Because the mass of heat is extremely small (10^{-16} kg for 1 J heat), it has been seldom measured but may show its significance in ultrafast heating or ultrahigh-rate heat transfer processes. Distinguished from the traditional [[Caloric]] theory which treats heat as substance without mass, the thermomass theory treats heat as a flux of substance with mass.&lt;ref&gt;M. Wang, B. Cao, and Z. Guo. General Heat Conduction Equation Based on Thermomass Theory. Frontiers in Heat and Mass Transfer. 1: 013005, 2010 http://dx.doi.org/10.5098/hmt.v1.1.3004&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the thermomass theory, a thermomass gas model has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Guo, Z.Y. and Zhu, H.Y., 2007, &quot;Motion and transfer of thermal mass-conservation equations of thermon gas and Fourier's law,&quot; Journal of Engineering Thermophysics 28(1), 86-88&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the heat transfer process can be treated as a thermomass gas flow in medium, driven by a thermomass pressure gradient (a potential field). The thermomass gas is a gas-like collection of massive thermons, which is defined as a unit quasi-particle carrying the thermal energy. For solids, the thermomass gas will be the phonon gas for crystals, attached on the electron gas for pure metals, or just between both for most of other solids. To concern the heat transfer behavior in medium, we only focus on the macroscopic flow characteristics of the thermomass gas rather than the details of each single thermon, and therefore we suppose the thermomass gas as a continuum and its transport process can be described by the classical Newton’s mechanics.

The equation of state and the governing equations for the thermomass gas transport based on methodologies of the classical mechanics lead to the general law of heat conduction to describe the relationship between the heat flux and the temperature field. The general law degenerates to the Fourier’s law if all the thermal inertial effects are negligible, and therefore provides us a new viewpoint to understand the Fourier’s law for heat conduction. The Fourier’s law essentially means the balance between the driving force and the resistant force in the thermomass fluid mechanics. Therefore the Fourier’s law will break down when the inertial effect is not negligible or the linear resistance-velocity relationship is not valid.

The thermal wave phenomena have been studied using the thermomass theory.&lt;ref&gt;Guo, Z.Y. and Hou, Q.W., 2010, &quot;Thermal Wave Based on the Thermomass Model,&quot; Journal of Heat Transfer-Transactions of the ASME 132(7), 072403.&lt;/ref&gt; The general law degenerates to the same form as the Cattaneo-Vernotte model with different physical significances for the characteristic time, when the time dependent parts of the thermal inertial effects are only considered. The characteristic time in the thermomass gas model means the lagging time from the temperature gradient to the corresponding heat flux, while the one in the Cattaneo-Vernotte model is the relaxation time from the thermal non-equilibrium to the equilibrium state. This difference leads to very different predictions for the thermal wave propagation behavior. For the dielectrics, the values of the characteristic time may differ by two orders of magnitude, which results in a much slower temperature response to a heat pulse predicted by the thermomass gas model than that by the CV model. Even for the heat waves in metals, where the two characteristic times are very close, the thermal inertial effects also cause different features of heat wave propagation. Especially the unphysical temperature distribution under zero predicted by the Cattaneo-Vernotte model, when two low-temperature cooling waves meet, will not appear in the predictions by our general law.

The thermomass theory has been applied to predict the anomalous thermal transport properties of nanomaterials. The general law describes the steady-state non-Fourier heat conduction when the time dependent terms are neglected, with the thermal inertial effects considered. The predictions show that the effective thermal conductivity of nanomaterials, which is smaller than the intrinsic one, decreases with the decreasing length for a given temperature difference between ends, and increases with the average temperature for a given length. These results agree with the existing theoretical or experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;M. Wang and Z. Guo. Understanding of size and temperature dependences of effective thermal conductivity of nanotubes. Physics Letter A 374: 4312-4315 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the thermomass theory has been compared with the extended irreversible thermodynamics and phonon hydrodynamics theory. As a statistic foundation,&lt;ref&gt;Y. Dong, B.Y. Cao and Z.Y. Guo. Generalized heat conduction laws based on thermomass theory and phonon hydrodynamics. J Appl Phys 110: 063504 2011 http://dx.doi.org/+10.1063/1.3634113&lt;/ref&gt; it has been found that the convective term in the generalized heat conduction equation based on thermomass theory actually comes from the nonlinear part of the phonon distribution function, thus the derivation can be regarded as a nonlinear solution of the phonon Boltzmann equation, which extends the content of the GK model. For nonequilibrium thermodynamics the thermomass theory presents a modification of the entropy and entropy production, avoiding the paradox of negative entropy production in heat wave propagation.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Dong and Z.Y. Guo. Entropy analyses for hyperbolic heat conduction based on the thermomass model. Int J Heat Mass Trans 54: 1924 2011 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2011.01.011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Dong B.Y. Cao and Z.Y. Guo. General expression for entropy production in transport processes based on the thermomass model. Phys Rev E 85: 061107 2012 http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.85.061107&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the entropy production originates from the establishment of Onsager Reciprocal Relation.So the validation of the reciprocal relation is also made from a thermomass perspective. The concept of generalized forces and fluxes are clarified to remove the controversy of the proof of reciprocal relations, i.e. whether or not the generalized flux can be expressed as the time derivative of certain state variables.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Dong. Clarification of Onsager reciprocal relations based on thermomass theory. Phys Rev E 86: 062101 2012 http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.86.062101&lt;/ref&gt;

thermal diffusivity is the ratio of the [[time derivative]] of [[temperature]] to its [[Second derivative#Generalization to higher dimensions|curvature]], quantifying the rate at which temperature concavity is &quot;smoothed out&quot;.

In [[continuum mechanics]], the '''infinitesimal strain theory''' is a mathematical approach to the  description of the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of a solid body in which the [[Displacement (vector)|displacements]] of the material [[particle]]s are assumed to be much smaller (indeed, [[infinitesimally]] smaller) than any relevant dimension of the body; so that its geometry and the constitutive properties of the material (such as [[density]] and [[stiffness]]) at each point of space can be assumed to be unchanged by the deformation.

With this assumption, the equations of continuum mechanics are considerably simplified.  This approach may also be called '''small deformation theory''', '''small displacement theory''', or '''small displacement-gradient theory'''.  It is contrasted with the [[finite strain theory]] where the opposite assumption is made.

The infinitesimal strain theory is commonly adopted in civil and mechanical engineering for the [[stress analysis]] of structures built from relatively stiff [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] materials like [[concrete]] and [[steel]], since a common goal in the design of such structures is to minimize their deformation under typical [[Structural load|loads]].

==Infinitesimal strain tensor==

For ''infinitesimal deformations'' of a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum body]], in which the displacements and the [[Deformation (mechanics)#Displacement|displacement gradients]] are small compared to unity, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf u\| \ll 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|\nabla \mathbf u\| \ll 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to perform a ''geometric linearisation'' of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf E\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and the Eulerian finite strain tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  In such a linearisation, the non-linear or second-order terms of the finite strain tensor are neglected. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E =\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T + (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\right)\approx \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;E_{KL}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial U_K}{\partial X_L}+\frac{\partial U_L}{\partial X_K}+\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_L}\right)\approx \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial U_K}{\partial X_L}+\frac{\partial U_L}{\partial X_K}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e =\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u)^T - \nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u(\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u)^T\right)\approx \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u)^T\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;e_{rs}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial x_s} +\frac{\partial u_s}{\partial x_r}-\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_s}\right)\approx \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial x_s} +\frac{\partial u_s}{\partial x_r}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This linearisation implies that the Lagrangian description and the Eulerian description are approximately the same as there is little difference in the material and spatial coordinates of a given material point in the continuum. Therefore, the material displacement gradient components and the spatial displacement gradient components are approximately equal. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E \approx \mathbf e \approx \boldsymbol \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}\left((\nabla\mathbf u)^T + \nabla\mathbf u\right) \qquad &lt;/math&gt;
or
&lt;math&gt;\qquad E_{KL}\approx e_{rs}\approx\varepsilon_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\left(u_{i,j}+u_{j,i}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the ''infinitesimal strain tensor'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \varepsilon\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, also called ''Cauchy's strain tensor'', ''linear strain tensor'', or ''small strain tensor''.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\varepsilon_{ij} &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\left(u_{i,j}+u_{j,i}\right)  \\
&amp;=
\left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
   \varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; \varepsilon_{23} \\
   \varepsilon_{31} &amp; \varepsilon_{32} &amp; \varepsilon_{33} \\
  \end{matrix}\right] \\
&amp;=
\left[\begin{matrix}
  \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_2}+\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_1}\right) &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_3}+\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_1}\right) \\
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_1}+\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_2}\right) &amp; \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_3}+\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_2}\right) \\
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_1}+\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_3}\right) &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_2}+\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_3}\right) &amp; \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_3} \\
  \end{matrix}\right] \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

or using different notation:
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} &amp; \varepsilon_{xy} &amp; \varepsilon_{xz} \\
   \varepsilon_{yx} &amp; \varepsilon_{yy} &amp; \varepsilon_{yz} \\
   \varepsilon_{zx} &amp; \varepsilon_{zy} &amp; \varepsilon_{zz} \\
  \end{matrix}\right]
=
\left[\begin{matrix}
  \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}\right) &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}+\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x}\right) \\
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}\right) &amp; \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial z}+\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial y}\right) \\
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}\right) &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial z}\right) &amp; \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \\
  \end{matrix}\right] \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, since the [[deformation gradient]] can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u} + \boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the second-order identity tensor, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\varepsilon=\frac{1}{2}\left(\boldsymbol{F}^T+\boldsymbol{F}\right)-\boldsymbol{I}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Also, from the general expression for the Lagrangian and Eulerian finite strain tensors we have

:&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{align}
\mathbf E_{(m)}&amp; =\frac{1}{2m}(\mathbf U^{2m}-\boldsymbol{I}) = \frac{1}{2m}[(\boldsymbol{F}^T\boldsymbol{F})^m - \boldsymbol{I}] \approx \frac{1}{2m}[\{\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u}+(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u})^T + \boldsymbol{I}\}^m - \boldsymbol{I}]\approx \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\\
\mathbf e_{(m)}&amp; =\frac{1}{2m}(\mathbf V^{2m}-\boldsymbol{I})= \frac{1}{2m}[(\boldsymbol{F}\boldsymbol{F}^T)^m - \boldsymbol{I}]\approx \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
 \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Geometric derivation of the infinitesimal strain tensor==
[[Image:2D geometric strain.svg|400px|right|thumb|Figure 1. Two-dimensional geometric deformation of an infinitesimal material element.]]
Consider a two-dimensional deformation of an infinitesimal rectangular material element with dimensions &lt;math&gt;dx\,\!&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;dy\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 1), which after deformation, takes the form of a rhombus. From the geometry of Figure 1 we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\overline {ab} &amp;= \sqrt{\left(dx+\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}dx \right)^2} \\
&amp;= dx\sqrt{1+2\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}+\left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}\right)^2} \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For very small displacement gradients, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\|\nabla \mathbf u\| \ll 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\overline {ab} \approx dx +\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Deformation (mechanics)#Strain measures|normal strain]] in the &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;-direction of the rectangular element is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_x = \frac{\overline {ab}-\overline {AB}}{\overline {AB}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
and knowing that &lt;math&gt;\overline {AB}= dx\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_x = \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the normal strain in the &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;-direction, and &lt;math&gt;z\,\!&lt;/math&gt;-direction, becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_y = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} \quad , \qquad  \varepsilon_z = \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Deformation (mechanics)#Strain measures|engineering shear strain]], or the change in angle between two originally orthogonal material lines, in this case line &lt;math&gt;\overline {AC}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline {AB}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{xy}= \alpha + \beta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

From the geometry of Figure 1 we have

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \alpha=\frac{\dfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}dx}{dx+\dfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx}=\frac{\dfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}}{1+\dfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}} \quad , \qquad \tan \beta=\frac{\dfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}dy}{dy+\dfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}dy}=\frac{\dfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}}{1+\dfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For small rotations, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\ll 1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \alpha \approx \alpha \quad , \qquad \tan \beta \approx \beta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and, again, for small displacement gradients, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} \quad , \qquad \beta=\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

thus

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{xy}= \alpha + \beta = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
By interchanging &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{xy} = \gamma_{yx}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for the &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;z\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;z\,\!&lt;/math&gt; planes, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{yz}=\gamma_{zy} = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial y} \quad , \qquad \gamma_{zx}=\gamma_{xz}= \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that the tensorial shear strain components of the infinitesimal strain tensor can then be expressed using the engineering strain definition, &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, as

&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} &amp; \varepsilon_{xy} &amp; \varepsilon_{xz} \\
   \varepsilon_{yx} &amp; \varepsilon_{yy} &amp; \varepsilon_{yz} \\
   \varepsilon_{zx} &amp; \varepsilon_{zy} &amp; \varepsilon_{zz} \\
  \end{matrix}\right] = \left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} &amp; \gamma_{xy}/2 &amp; \gamma_{xz}/2 \\
   \gamma_{yx}/2 &amp; \varepsilon_{yy} &amp; \gamma_{yz}/2 \\
   \gamma_{zx}/2 &amp; \gamma_{zy}/2 &amp; \varepsilon_{zz} \\
  \end{matrix}\right]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Physical interpretation of the infinitesimal strain tensor===
From [[Finite deformation tensor|finite strain theory]] we have

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{x}^2 - d\mathbf{X}^2 = d\mathbf X \cdot 2\mathbf E \cdot d\mathbf X \quad\text{or}\quad (dx)^2 - (dX)^2 = 2E_{KL}\,dX_K\,dX_L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For infinitesimal strains then we have

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{x}^2 - d\mathbf{X}^2 = d\mathbf X \cdot 2\mathbf{\boldsymbol \varepsilon} \cdot d\mathbf X \quad\text{or}\quad (dx)^2 - (dX)^2 = 2\varepsilon_{KL}\,dX_K\,dX_L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by &lt;math&gt;(dX)^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx-dX}{dX}\frac{dx+dX}{dX}=2\varepsilon_{ij}\frac{dX_i}{dX}\frac{dX_j}{dX}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For small deformations we assume that &lt;math&gt;dx \approx dX\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, thus the second term of the left hand side becomes: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx+dX}{dX} \approx 2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Then we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx-dX}{dX}=\varepsilon_{ij}N_iN_j = \mathbf N \cdot \boldsymbol \varepsilon \cdot \mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_i=\frac{dX_i}{dX}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is the unit vector in the direction of &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and the left-hand-side expression is the [[Deformation (mechanics)#Strain measures|normal strain]] &lt;math&gt;e_{(\mathbf N)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. For the particular case of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;X_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; direction, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N=\mathbf I_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;e_{(\mathbf I_1)}=\mathbf I_1 \cdot \boldsymbol \varepsilon \cdot \mathbf I_1=\varepsilon_{11}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N=\mathbf I_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N=\mathbf I_3\,\!&lt;/math&gt; we can find the normal strains &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{22}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{33}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Therefore, the diagonal elements of the infinitesimal strain tensor are the normal strains in the coordinate directions.

=== Strain transformation rules ===
If we choose an [[orthonormal basis|orthonormal coordinate system]] (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2,\mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt;) we can write the tensor in terms of components with respect to those base vectors as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \varepsilon_{ij} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j
 &lt;/math&gt;
In matrix form,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
     \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; \varepsilon_{23} \\
     \varepsilon_{13} &amp; \varepsilon_{23} &amp; \varepsilon_{33} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
We can easily choose to use another orthonormal coordinate system (&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1,\hat{\mathbf{e}}_2,\hat{\mathbf{e}}_3&lt;/math&gt;) instead.  In that case the components of the tensor are different, say
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \hat{\varepsilon}_{ij} \hat{\mathbf{e}}_i\otimes\hat{\mathbf{e}}_j \quad \implies \quad \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \begin{bmatrix} \hat{\varepsilon}_{11} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{12} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{13} \\
     \hat{\varepsilon}_{12} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{22} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{23} \\
     \hat{\varepsilon}_{13} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{23} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{33} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components of the strain in the two coordinate systems are related by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{\varepsilon}_{ij} = \ell_{ip}~\ell_{jq}~\varepsilon_{pq}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the [[Einstein summation convention]] for repeated indices has been used and &lt;math&gt;\ell_{ij} = \hat{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;.  In matrix form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\hat{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}}} = \underline{\underline{\mathbf{L}}} ~\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}}~ \underline{\underline{\mathbf{L}}}^T
 &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{bmatrix} \hat{\varepsilon}_{11} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{12} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{13} \\
     \hat{\varepsilon}_{21} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{22} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{23} \\
     \hat{\varepsilon}_{31} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{32} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{33} \end{bmatrix}
   = \begin{bmatrix} \ell_{11} &amp; \ell_{12} &amp; \ell_{13} \\ \ell_{21} &amp; \ell_{22} &amp; \ell_{23} \\ \ell_{31} &amp; \ell_{32} &amp; \ell_{33} \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
     \varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; \varepsilon_{23} \\
     \varepsilon_{31} &amp; \varepsilon_{32} &amp; \varepsilon_{33} \end{bmatrix}
     \begin{bmatrix} \ell_{11} &amp; \ell_{12} &amp; \ell_{13} \\ \ell_{21} &amp; \ell_{22} &amp; \ell_{23} \\ \ell_{31} &amp; \ell_{32} &amp; \ell_{33} \end{bmatrix}^T
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Strain invariants ===
Certain operations on the strain tensor give the same result without regard to which orthonormal coordinate system is used to represent the components of strain.  The results of these operations are called '''strain invariants'''.  The most commonly used strain invariants are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   I_1 &amp; = \mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}) \\
   I_2 &amp; = \tfrac{1}{2}\{\mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^2) - [\mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})]^2\} \\
   I_3 &amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
In terms of components
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   I_1 &amp; = \varepsilon_{11} + \varepsilon_{22} + \varepsilon_{33} \\
   I_2 &amp; = \varepsilon_{12}^2 + \varepsilon_{23}^2 + \varepsilon_{31}^2 - \varepsilon_{11}\varepsilon_{22} - \varepsilon_{22}\varepsilon_{33} - \varepsilon_{33}\varepsilon_{11} \\
   I_3 &amp; = \varepsilon_{11}(\varepsilon_{22}\varepsilon_{33} - \varepsilon_{23}^2) - \varepsilon_{12}(\varepsilon_{12}\varepsilon_{33}-\varepsilon_{23}\varepsilon_{31}) + \varepsilon_{13}(\varepsilon_{12}\varepsilon_{23}-\varepsilon_{22}\varepsilon_{31})
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Principal strains===
It can be shown that it is possible to find a coordinate system (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_1,\mathbf{n}_2,\mathbf{n}_3&lt;/math&gt;) in which the components of the strain tensor are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_{1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; \varepsilon_{2} &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varepsilon_{3} \end{bmatrix} \quad \implies \quad \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \varepsilon_{1} \mathbf{n}_1\otimes\mathbf{n}_1 + \varepsilon_{2} \mathbf{n}_2\otimes\mathbf{n}_2 + \varepsilon_{3} \mathbf{n}_3\otimes\mathbf{n}_3 
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components of the strain tensor in the (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_1,\mathbf{n}_2,\mathbf{n}_3&lt;/math&gt;) coordinate system are called the '''principal strains''' and the directions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_i&lt;/math&gt; are called the directions of principal strain.  Since there are no shear strain components in this coordinate system, the principal strains represent the maximum and minimum stretches of an elemental volume.

If we are given the components of the strain tensor in an arbitrary orthonormal coordinate system, we can find the principal strains using an [[eigenvalue decomposition]] determined by solving the system of equations
:&lt;math&gt;
   (\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} - \varepsilon_i~\underline{\underline{\mathbf{I}}})~\mathbf{n}_i = \underline{\underline{\mathbf{0}}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
This system of equations is equivalent to finding the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_i&lt;/math&gt; along which the stress tensor becomes a pure stretch with no shear component.

===Volumetric strain{{anchor|Volumetric strain}}=== &lt;!-- anchor: [[Volumetric strain]] redirects here --&gt;
The ''dilatation'' (the relative variation of the volume) is the [[trace (matrix)|trace]] of the tensor:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\frac{\Delta V}{V_0} = \varepsilon_{11} + \varepsilon_{22} + \varepsilon_{33}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Actually, if we consider a cube with an edge length ''a'', it is a quasi-cube after the deformation (the variations of the angles do not change the volume) with the dimensions &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (1 + \varepsilon_{11}) \times a \cdot (1 + \varepsilon_{22}) \times a \cdot (1 + \varepsilon_{33})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, thus
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta V}{V_0} = \frac{\left ( 1 + \varepsilon_{11} + \varepsilon_{22} + \varepsilon_{33} + \varepsilon_{11} \cdot \varepsilon_{22} + \varepsilon_{11} \cdot \varepsilon_{33}+ \varepsilon_{22} \cdot \varepsilon_{33} + \varepsilon_{11} \cdot \varepsilon_{22} \cdot \varepsilon_{33} \right ) \cdot a^3 - a^3}{a^3}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
as we consider small deformations,
:&lt;math&gt;1 \gg \varepsilon_{ii} \gg \varepsilon_{ii} \cdot \varepsilon_{jj} \gg \varepsilon_{11} \cdot \varepsilon_{22} \cdot \varepsilon_{33} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
therefore the formula.

[[Image:Approximation volume deformation.png|400px]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Real variation of volume  (top) and the approximated one (bottom): the green drawing shows the estimated volume and the orange drawing the neglected volume&lt;/small&gt;

In case of pure shear, we can see that there is no change of the volume.

===Strain deviator tensor===
The infinitesimal strain tensor &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, similarly to the [[Cauchy stress tensor]], can be expressed as the sum of two other tensors: 
# a '''mean strain tensor''' or '''volumetric strain tensor''' or '''spherical strain tensor''', &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_M\delta_{ij}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, related to dilation or volume change; and
# a deviatoric component called the '''strain deviator tensor''', &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon'_{ij}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, related to distortion.

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}= \varepsilon'_{ij} + \varepsilon_M\delta_{ij}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_M\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the mean strain given by

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_M=\frac{\varepsilon_{kk}}{3}=\frac{\varepsilon_{11}+\varepsilon_{22}+\varepsilon_{33}}{3}=\tfrac{1}{3}I^e_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The deviatoric strain tensor can be obtained by subtracting the mean strain tensor from the infinitesimal strain tensor:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\ \varepsilon'_{ij} &amp;= \varepsilon_{ij} - \frac{\varepsilon_{kk}}{3}\delta_{ij} \\
 \left[{\begin{matrix}
   \varepsilon'_{11} &amp; \varepsilon'_{12} &amp; \varepsilon'_{13} \\
   \varepsilon'_{21} &amp; \varepsilon'_{22} &amp; \varepsilon'_{23} \\
   \varepsilon'_{31} &amp; \varepsilon'_{32} &amp; \varepsilon'_{33} \\
  \end{matrix}}\right]
&amp;=\left[{\begin{matrix}
   \varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
   \varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; \varepsilon_{23} \\
   \varepsilon_{31} &amp; \varepsilon_{32} &amp; \varepsilon_{33} \\
  \end{matrix}}\right]-\left[{\begin{matrix}
   \varepsilon_M &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; \varepsilon_M &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varepsilon_M \\
  \end{matrix}}\right] \\
&amp;=\left[{\begin{matrix}
   \varepsilon_{11}-\varepsilon_M &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
   \varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22}-\varepsilon_M &amp; \varepsilon_{23} \\
   \varepsilon_{31} &amp; \varepsilon_{32} &amp; \varepsilon_{33}-\varepsilon_M \\
  \end{matrix}}\right] \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Octahedral strains===
Let (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_1, \mathbf{n}_2, \mathbf{n}_3&lt;/math&gt;) be the directions of the three principal strains.  An '''octahedral plane''' is one whose normal makes equal angles with the three principal directions.  The engineering [[shear strain]] on an octahedral plane is called the '''octahedral shear strain''' and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \gamma_{\mathrm{oct}} = \tfrac{2}{3}\sqrt{(\varepsilon_1-\varepsilon_2)^2 + (\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_3)^2 + (\varepsilon_3-\varepsilon_1)^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2, \varepsilon_3&lt;/math&gt; are the principal strains.  {{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[normal strain]] on an octahedral plane is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{\mathrm{oct}} = \tfrac{1}{3}(\varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2 + \varepsilon_3)
 &lt;/math&gt;
{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Equivalent strain ===
A scalar quantity called the '''equivalent strain''', or the [[von Mises]] equivalent strain, is often used to describe the state of strain in solids.  Several definitions of equivalent strain can be found in the literature.  A definition that is commonly used in the literature on [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{\mathrm{eq}} = \sqrt{\tfrac{2}{3} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{dev}}:\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{dev}}}  = \sqrt{\tfrac{2}{3}\varepsilon_{ij}^{\mathrm{dev}}\varepsilon_{ij}^{\mathrm{dev}}} 
  ~;~~ \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{dev}} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} - \tfrac{1}{3}\mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})~\boldsymbol{1} 
 &lt;/math&gt;
This quantity is work conjugate to the equivalent stress defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_{\mathrm{eq}} = \sqrt{\tfrac{3}{2} \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{\mathrm{dev}}:\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{\mathrm{dev}}}
 &lt;/math&gt;

==Compatibility equations==
{{Main|Compatibility (mechanics)}}
For prescribed strain components &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; the strain tensor equation &lt;math&gt;u_{i,j}+u_{j,i}= 2 \varepsilon_{ij}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; represents a system of six differential equations for the determination of three displacements components &lt;math&gt;u_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, giving an over-determined system. Thus, a solution does not generally exist for an arbitrary choice of strain components. Therefore, some restrictions, named ''compatibility equations'', are imposed upon the strain components. With the addition of the three compatibility equations the number of independent equations is reduced to three, matching the number of unknown displacement components. These constraints on the strain tensor were discovered by [[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant|Saint-Venant]], and are called the &quot;[[Saint-Venant's compatibility condition|Saint Venant compatibility equations]]&quot;.

The compatibility functions serve to assure a single-valued continuous displacement function &lt;math&gt;u_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  If the elastic medium is visualised as a set of infinitesimal cubes in the unstrained state, after the medium is strained, an arbitrary strain tensor may not yield a situation in which the distorted cubes still fit together without overlapping.

In index notation, the compatibility equations are expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij,km}+\varepsilon_{km,ij}-\varepsilon_{ik,jm}-\varepsilon_{jm,ik}=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \epsilon_y}{\partial z^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \epsilon_z}{\partial y^2} = 2 \frac{\partial^2 \epsilon_{yz}}{\partial y \partial z}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Special cases ==

===Plane strain===
[[Image:Plane strain.svg|500px|right|thumb|Plane strain state in a continuum.]]
In real engineering components, [[Stress (physics)|stress]] (and strain) are 3-D [[tensor]]s but in prismatic structures such as a long metal billet, the length of the structure is much greater than the other two dimensions.   The strains associated with length, i.e., the normal strain &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{33}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and the shear strains &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{13}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{23}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (if the length is the 3-direction) are constrained by nearby material and are small compared to the ''cross-sectional strains''. Plane strain is then an acceptable approximation. The [[strain tensor]] for plane strain is written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; 0 \\
\varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; 0 \\
     0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which the double underline indicates a second order [[tensor]].   This strain state is called ''plane strain''.   The corresponding stress tensor is:

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}} = \begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} &amp; 0 \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; 0 \\
     0      &amp;     0       &amp; \sigma_{33}\end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which the non-zero &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{33}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is needed to maintain the constraint &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{33} = 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.   This stress term can be temporarily removed from the analysis to leave only the in-plane terms, effectively reducing the 3-D problem to a much simpler 2-D problem.

=== Antiplane strain ===
{{main|Antiplane shear}}
Antiplane strain is another special state of strain that can occur in a body, for instance in a region close to a [[screw dislocation]].  The [[strain tensor]] for antiplane strain is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varepsilon_{23}\\
 \varepsilon_{13}    &amp;    \varepsilon_{23}      &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Infinitesimal rotation tensor ==
The infinitesimal strain tensor is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \frac{1}{2} [\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u} + (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u})^T]
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore the displacement gradient can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} + \boldsymbol{\omega}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\omega} := \frac{1}{2} [\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u} - (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u})^T]
&lt;/math&gt;
The quantity &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; is the '''infinitesimal rotation tensor'''.  This tensor is [[skew symmetric]]. For infinitesimal deformations the scalar components of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the condition &lt;math&gt;|\omega_{ij}| \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that the displacement gradient is small only if '''both''' the strain tensor and the rotation tensor are infinitesimal.

=== The axial vector ===
A skew symmetric second-order tensor has three independent scalar components.  These three components are used to define an '''axial vector''', &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;, as follows
:&lt;math&gt;
   \omega_{ij} = -\epsilon_{ijk}~w_k ~;~~ w_i = -\tfrac{1}{2}~\epsilon_{ijk}~\omega_{jk}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permutation symbol]].  In matrix form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\omega}}} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -w_3 &amp; w_2 \\ w_3 &amp; 0 &amp; -w_1 \\ -w_2 &amp; w_1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} ~;~~ \underline{\mathbf{w}} = \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \\ w_3 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The axial vector is also called the '''infinitesimal rotation vector'''.  The rotation vector is related to the displacement gradient by the relation
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{w} = \tfrac{1}{2}~\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{u}
 &lt;/math&gt;
In index notation
:&lt;math&gt;
   w_i = \tfrac{1}{2}~\epsilon_{ijk}~u_{k,j}
 &lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;\lVert\boldsymbol{\omega}\rVert \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt; then the material undergoes an approximate rigid body rotation of magnitude &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{w}|&lt;/math&gt; around the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Relation between the strain tensor and the rotation vector ===
Given a continuous, single-valued displacement field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding infinitesimal strain tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;, we have (see [[Tensor derivative (continuum mechanics)]])
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = e_{ijk}~\varepsilon_{lj,i}~\mathbf{e}_k\otimes\mathbf{e}_l
    = \tfrac{1}{2}~e_{ijk}~[u_{l,ji} + u_{j,li}]~\mathbf{e}_k\otimes\mathbf{e}_l
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since a change in the order of differentiation does not change the result, &lt;math&gt;u_{l,ji} = u_{l,ij}\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore
:&lt;math&gt;
   \,e_{ijk} u_{l,ji} = (e_{12k}+e_{21k}) u_{l,12} + (e_{13k}+e_{31k}) u_{l,13} + (e_{23k} + e_{32k}) u_{l,32} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
Also
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tfrac{1}{2}~e_{ijk}~u_{j,li} = \left(\tfrac{1}{2}~e_{ijk}~u_{j,i}\right)_{,l} = \left(\tfrac{1}{2}~e_{kij}~u_{j,i}\right)_{,l} = w_{k,l}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Hence
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = w_{k,l}~\mathbf{e}_k\otimes\mathbf{e}_l = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{w}
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Relation between rotation tensor and rotation vector ===
From an important identity regarding the [[Tensor derivative (continuum mechanics)|curl of a tensor]] we know that for a continuous, single-valued displacement field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u}) = \boldsymbol{0}.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} + \boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; we have
&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{\omega} = -\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = - \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{w}.
 &lt;/math&gt;

== Strain tensor in cylindrical coordinates ==
In [[cylindrical polar coordinates]] (&lt;math&gt;r, \theta, z&lt;/math&gt;), the displacement vector can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{u} = u_r~\mathbf{e}_r + u_\theta~\mathbf{e}_\theta + u_z~\mathbf{e}_z
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components of the strain tensor in a cylindrical coordinate system are given by &lt;ref name=Slaughter&gt;Slaughter, W. S., 2002, '''The Linearised Theory of Elasticity''', Birkhauser.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \varepsilon_{rr} &amp; = \cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} \\
    \varepsilon_{\theta\theta} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial \theta} + u_r\right) \\
    \varepsilon_{zz} &amp; = \cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \\
    \varepsilon_{r\theta} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} + \cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r}- \cfrac{u_\theta}{r}\right) \\
    \varepsilon_{\theta z} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial z} + \cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial \theta}\right) \\
    \varepsilon_{zr} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial z} + \cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial r}\right) 
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

== Strain tensor in spherical coordinates ==
In [[spherical coordinates]] (&lt;math&gt;r, \theta, \phi&lt;/math&gt;), the displacement vector can be written as
[[File:3D Spherical.svg|thumb|240px|right|Spherical coordinates (''r'', ''&amp;theta;'', ''&amp;phi;'') as commonly used in ''physics'': radial distance ''r'', polar angle ''&amp;theta;'' ([[theta]]), and azimuthal angle ''&amp;phi;'' ([[phi]]). The symbol ''&amp;rho;'' ([[rho]]) is often used instead of ''r''.]]
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{u} = u_r~\mathbf{e}_r + u_\theta~\mathbf{e}_\theta + u_\phi~\mathbf{e}_\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components of the strain tensor in a spherical coordinate system are given by &lt;ref name=Slaughter/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \varepsilon_{rr} &amp; = \cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} \\
    \varepsilon_{\theta\theta} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial \theta} + u_r\right) \\
    \varepsilon_{\phi\phi} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{r\sin\theta}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_\phi}{\partial \phi} + u_r\sin\theta + u_\theta\cos\theta\right)\\
    \varepsilon_{r\theta} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} + \cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r}- \cfrac{u_\theta}{r}\right) \\
    \varepsilon_{\theta \phi} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2r}\left(\cfrac{1}{\sin\theta}\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial \phi} + \cfrac{\partial u_\phi}{\partial \theta} - u_\phi\cot\theta\right) \\
    \varepsilon_{\phi r} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{1}{r\sin\theta}\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial \phi} + \cfrac{\partial u_\phi}{\partial r} - \cfrac{u_\phi}{r}\right) 
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="915">In relation to [[biomechanics]], the '''aggregate modulus''' (Ha) is a measurement of the stiffness of a material at equilibrium when fluid has ceased flowing through it. The aggregate modulus can be calculated from [[Young's modulus]] (E) and the [[Poisson ratio]] (v).


:&lt;math&gt;
Ha=E(1-v)/[(1+v)(1-2v)]
&lt;/math&gt;


The aggregate modulus of a similar specimen is determined from a unidirectional ''deformational'' testing configuration, i.e., the only non-zero strain component is E&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, as opposed to the Young's modulus, which is determined from a unidirectional ''loading'' testing configuration, i.e., the only non-zero stress component is, say, in the '''e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' direction.  In this test, the only non-zero component of the stress tensor is T&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Physical principles==

===Circular polarization of light===
{{main|Circular polarization}}
[[Electromagnetic radiation]] consists of an electric (E) and magnetic (B) field that oscillate perpendicular to one another and to the propagating direction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alison Rodger|author2=Bengt Nordén|title=Circular dichroism and linear dichroism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=THeKGC99hJcC|accessdate=29 April 2011|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-855897-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[transverse wave]]. While [[Polarization (waves)|linearly polarized]] light occurs when the electric field vector oscillates only in one plane, circularly polarized light occurs when the direction of the electric field vector rotates about its propagation direction while the vector retains constant magnitude. At a single point in space, the circularly polarized-vector will trace out a circle over one period of the wave frequency, hence the name. The two diagrams below show the electric vectors of linearly and circularly polarized light, at one moment of time, for a range of positions; the plot of the circularly polarized electric vector forms a helix along the direction of propagation (k). For left circularly polarized light (LCP) with propagation towards the observer, the electric vector rotates [[clockwise|counterclockwise]].&lt;ref name=&quot;E. I. Solomon and A. B. P. Lever 2006 78&quot;/&gt; For right circularly polarized light (RCP), the electric vector rotates clockwise.

[[File:Linearly pol.png]]     [[File:Circularly pol.png]]

===Interaction of circularly polarized light with matter===
When circularly polarized light passes through an absorbing optically active medium, the speeds between right and left polarizations differ (c&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;{{unicode| ≠}} c&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as their [[wavelength]] ({{unicode|λ}}&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;{{unicode| ≠ λ}}&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) and the extent to which they are absorbed ({{unicode|ε}}&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;{{unicode|≠ε}}&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;). ''Circular dichroism'' is the difference {{unicode|Δε ≡ ε}}&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;- {{unicode|ε}}&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt; The electric field of a light beam causes a linear displacement of charge when interacting with a molecule ([[electric dipole]]), whereas its magnetic field causes a circulation of charge ([[magnetic dipole]]). These two motions combined cause an excitation of an [[electron]] in a helical motion, which includes [[translation (physics)|translation]] and [[rotation]] and their associated [[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]. The experimentally determined relationship between the [[rotational strength]] (R) of a sample and the {{unicode|Δε}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;R_{exp} = \frac{3hc10^{3} \ln(10)}{32\pi^{3}N_A} \int \frac{\Delta\epsilon}{\nu} d{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
The rotational strength has also been determined theoretically,
:&lt;math&gt;R_{theo} = \frac{1}{2mc} Im \int \Psi_g \widehat{M}_{(elec. dipole)} \Psi_e d\tau \bullet \int \Psi_g \widehat{M}_{(mag. dipole)} \Psi_e d\tau &lt;/math&gt;
We see from these two equations that in order to have non-zero &lt;math&gt;\Delta\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, the electric and magnetic dipole moment operators (&lt;math&gt;\widehat{M}_{(elec. dipole)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{M}_{(mag. dipole)}&lt;/math&gt;) must transform as the same [[group theory|irreducible representation]]. &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_n &lt;/math&gt; are the only [[point groups]] where this can occur, making only chiral molecules CD active.

Simply put, since circularly polarized light itself is &quot;chiral&quot;, it interacts differently with [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecules]]. That is, the two types of circularly polarized light are absorbed to different extents. In a CD experiment, equal amounts of left and right circularly polarized light of a selected wavelength are alternately radiated into a (chiral) sample. One of the two polarizations is absorbed more than the other one, and this wavelength-dependent difference of absorption is measured, yielding the CD spectrum of the sample. Due to the interaction with the molecule, the electric field vector of the light traces out an elliptical path after passing through the sample.

It is important that the chirality of the molecule can be conformational rather than structural. That is, for instance, a protein molecule with a helical [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] can have a CD that changes with changes in the conformation.

====Delta absorbance====
By definition,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta A=A_L-A_R \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ΔA (Delta Absorbance) is the difference between absorbance of left circularly polarized (LCP) and right circularly polarized (RCP) light (this is what is usually measured). ΔA is a function of [[wavelength]], so for a measurement to be meaningful the wavelength at which it was performed must be known.

====Molar circular dichroism====
It can also be expressed, by applying [[Beer-Lambert law|Beer's law]], as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta A = (\epsilon_L - \epsilon_R)Cl\,&lt;/math&gt;

where
:ε&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and ε&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; are the molar extinction coefficients for LCP and RCP light,
:''C'' is the molar concentration
:''l'' is the path length in centimeters (cm).

Then

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \epsilon =\epsilon_L-\epsilon_R\,&lt;/math&gt;

is the molar circular dichroism. This intrinsic property is what is usually meant by the circular dichroism of the substance. Since &lt;math&gt; \Delta \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a function of wavelength, a molar circular dichroism value (&lt;math&gt; \Delta \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;) must specify the wavelength at which it is valid.

====Extrinsic effects on circular dichroism====
In many practical applications of circular dichroism (CD), as discussed below, the measured CD is not simply an intrinsic property of the molecule, but rather depends on the molecular conformation. In such a case the CD may also be a function of temperature, concentration, and the chemical environment, including solvents. In this case the reported CD value must also specify these other relevant factors in order to be meaningful.

====Molar ellipticity====

Although ΔA is usually measured, for historical reasons most measurements are reported in degrees of ellipticity.
Molar ellipticity is circular dichroism corrected for concentration. Molar circular dichroism and molar ellipticity, [''θ''], are readily interconverted by the equation:

[[File:Electric Vectors 1.png|thumb|Electric_Vectors|200px|right|Elliptical polarized light (violet) is composed of unequal contributions of right (blue) and left (red) circular polarized light.]]

:&lt;math&gt; [\theta] = 3298.2\,\Delta \varepsilon.\, &lt;/math&gt;

This relationship is derived by defining the [[polarization (waves)|ellipticity of the polarization]] as:

:&lt;math&gt; \tan \theta = \frac{E_R - E_L}{E_R + E_L} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where
:E&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; are the magnitudes of the [[electric field]] [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] of the right-circularly and left-circularly polarized light, respectively.

When E&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; equals E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (when there is no difference in the absorbance of right- and left-circular polarized light), θ is 0° and the light is [[linear polarization|linearly polarized]]. When either E&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; or E&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to zero (when there is complete absorbance of the circular polarized light in one direction), θ is 45° and the light is [[circular polarization|circularly polarized]].

Generally, the circular dichroism effect is small, so tanθ is small and can be approximated as θ in [[radian]]s. Since the [[Radiant intensity|intensity]] or [[irradiance]], I, of light is proportional to the square of the electric-field vector, the ellipticity becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta (\text{radians}) = \frac{(I_R^{1/2} - I_L^{1/2})}{(I_R^{1/2} + I_L^{1/2})}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then by substituting for I using [[Beer–Lambert law|Beer's law]] in [[natural logarithm]] form:

:&lt;math&gt; I = I_0 e^{-A\ln 10}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The ellipticity can now be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta (\text{radians}) = \frac{(e^{\frac{-A_R}{2}\ln 10} - e^{\frac{-A_L}{2}\ln 10})}{(e^{\frac{-A_R}{2}\ln 10} + e^{\frac{-A_L}{2}\ln 10})} = \frac{e^{\Delta A \frac{\ln 10}{2}} - 1}{e^{\Delta A \frac{\ln 10}{2}} + 1} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since ΔA&amp;nbsp;&lt;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1, this expression can be approximated by expanding the exponentials in a [[Taylor series]] to first-order and then discarding terms of ΔA in comparison with unity and converting from [[radian]]s to degrees:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta (\text{degrees}) = \Delta A \left( \frac {\ln 10}{4} \right) \left( \frac {180}{\pi} \right)\, &lt;/math&gt;

The linear dependence of solute concentration and pathlength is removed by defining molar ellipticity as,

:&lt;math&gt; [\theta] = \frac {100\theta}{\text{Cl}}\, &lt;/math&gt;

Then combining the last two expression with [[Beer–Lambert law|Beer's law]], molar ellipticity becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; [\theta]= 100 \,\Delta \varepsilon \left( \frac {\ln 10}{4} \right) \left( \frac {180}{\pi} \right) = 3298.2\,\Delta \varepsilon \,&lt;/math&gt;

The units of molar ellipticity are historically (deg·cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/dmol). To calculate molar ellipticity, the sample concentration (g/L), cell pathlength (cm), and the molecular weight (g/mol) must be known.

If the sample is a protein, the mean residue weight (average molecular weight of the amino acid residues it contains) is often used in place of the molecular weight, essentially treating the protein as a solution of amino acids. Using mean residue ellipticity facilitates comparing the CD of proteins of different molecular weight; use of this normalized CD is important in studies of protein structure.

====Mean residue ellipticity====
Methods for estimating secondary structure in polymers, proteins and polypeptides in particular, often require that the measured molar ellipticity spectrum be converted to a normalized value, specifically a value independent of the polymer length. Mean residue ellipticity is used for this purpose; it is simply the measured molar ellipticity of the molecule divided by the number of monomer units (residues) in the molecule.

==Application to biological molecules==
[[File:Circular dichroism and structures calculation-protein in detergents.svg|thumb|400px|Upper panel: Circular dichroism spectroscopy in the ultraviolet wavelength region (UV-CD) of MBP-cytochrome b&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; fusion protein in different detergent solutions. It shows that the protein in DM, as well as in Triton X-100 solution, recovered its structure. However the spectra obtained from SDS solution shows decreased ellipticity in the range between 200–210&amp;nbsp;nm, which indicates incomplete secondary structure recovery.&lt;br/&gt;
Lower panel: The content of secondary structures predicted from the CD spectra using the CDSSTR algorithm. The protein in SDS solution shows increased content of unordered structures and decreased helices content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Surma MA., Szczepaniak A., Króliczewski J.|title=Comparative Studies on Detergent-Assisted Apocytochrome b6 Reconstitution into Liposomal Bilayers Monitored by Zetasizer Instruments|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=11|year=2014|pages=e111341|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0111341}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In general, this phenomenon will be exhibited in absorption bands of any [[optical activity|optically active]] molecule. As a consequence, circular dichroism is exhibited by biological molecules, because of their [[dextrorotary]] and [[levorotary]] components. Even more important is that a [[secondary structure]] will also impart a distinct CD to its respective molecules. Therefore, the [[alpha helix]] of proteins and the [[double helix]] of [[nucleic acids]] have CD spectral signatures representative of their structures.  The capacity of CD to give a representative structural signature makes it a powerful tool in modern biochemistry with applications that can be found in virtually every field of study.

CD is closely related to the [[optical rotatory dispersion]] (ORD) technique, and is generally considered to be more advanced. CD is measured in or near the absorption bands of the molecule of interest, while ORD can be measured far from these bands. CD's advantage is apparent in the data analysis. Structural elements are more clearly distinguished since their recorded bands do not overlap extensively at particular wavelengths as they do in ORD. In principle these two spectral measurements can be interconverted through an integral transform ([[Kramers–Kronig relation]]), if all the absorptions are included in the measurements.

The far-UV ([[ultraviolet]]) CD spectrum of proteins can reveal important characteristics of their [[secondary structure]]. CD spectra can be readily used to estimate the fraction of a molecule that is in the [[alpha-helix]] conformation, the [[beta-sheet]] conformation, the [[beta-turn]] conformation, or some other (e.g. [[random coil]]) conformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17896349&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitmore L, Wallace BA |title=Protein secondary structure analyses from circular dichroism spectroscopy: methods and reference databases |journal=Biopolymers |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=392–400 |year=2008|pmid=17896349 |doi=10.1002/bip.20853}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17406547&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greenfield NJ |title=Using circular dichroism spectra to estimate protein secondary structure |journal=Nature protocols |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=2876–90 |year=2006 |pmid=17406547 |doi=10.1038/nprot.2006.202 |pmc=2728378}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fractional assignments place important constraints on the possible secondary conformations that the protein can be in. CD cannot, in general, say where the alpha helices that are detected are located within the molecule or even completely predict how many there are. Despite this, CD is a valuable tool, especially for showing changes in conformation. It can, for instance, be used to study how the secondary structure of a molecule changes as a function of temperature or of the concentration of denaturing agents, e.g. [[Guanidine|Guanidinium chloride]] or [[urea]]. In this way it can reveal important thermodynamic information about the molecule (such as the [[enthalpy]] and [[Gibbs free energy]] of denaturation) that cannot otherwise be easily obtained. Anyone attempting to study a protein will find CD a valuable tool for verifying that the protein is in its native conformation before undertaking extensive and/or expensive experiments with it. Also, there are a number of other uses for CD spectroscopy in protein chemistry not related to alpha-helix fraction estimation.

The near-UV CD spectrum (&gt;250&amp;nbsp;nm) of proteins provides information on the [[tertiary structure]]. The signals obtained in the 250–300&amp;nbsp;nm region are due to the absorption, dipole orientation and the nature of the surrounding environment of the phenylalanine, tyrosine, cysteine (or S-S [[disulfide bond|disulfide bridges]]) and tryptophan [[amino acid]]s. Unlike in far-UV CD, the near-UV CD spectrum cannot be assigned to any particular 3D structure. Rather, near-UV CD spectra provide structural information on the nature of the prosthetic groups in proteins, e.g., the heme groups in [[hemoglobin]] and [[cytochrome c]].

Visible CD spectroscopy is a very powerful technique to study metal–protein interactions and can resolve individual d–d electronic transitions as separate bands. CD spectra in the visible light region are only produced when a metal ion is in a chiral environment, thus, free metal ions in solution are not detected. This has the advantage of only observing the protein-bound metal, so pH dependence and stoichiometries are readily obtained. Optical activity in transition metal ion complexes have been attributed to configurational, conformational and the vicinal effects. Klewpatinond and Viles (2007) have produced a set of empirical rules for predicting the appearance of visible CD spectra for Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; square-planar complexes involving histidine and main-chain coordination.

CD gives less specific structural information than [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[protein NMR]] spectroscopy, for example, which both give atomic resolution data. However, CD spectroscopy is a quick method that does not require large amounts of proteins or extensive data processing. Thus CD can be used to survey a large number of [[solvent]] conditions, varying [[temperature]], [[pH]], [[salinity]], and the presence of various cofactors.

CD [[spectroscopy]] is usually used to study proteins in solution, and thus it complements methods that study the solid state. This is also a limitation, in that many proteins are embedded in [[biological membrane|membranes]] in their native state, and solutions containing membrane structures are often strongly scattering. CD is sometimes measured in thin films.

==Experimental limitations==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2010}}

CD has also been studied in [[carbohydrates]], but with limited success due to the experimental difficulties associated with measurement of CD spectra in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region of the spectrum (100–200&amp;nbsp;nm), where the corresponding CD bands of unsubstituted carbohydrates lie. Substituted carbohydrates with bands above the VUV region have been successfully measured.

Measurement of CD is also complicated by the fact that typical aqueous buffer systems often absorb in the range where structural features exhibit differential absorption of circularly polarized light. [[Phosphate]], [[sulfate]], [[carbonate]], and [[acetate]] buffers are generally incompatible with CD unless made extremely dilute e.g. in the 10–50 mM range. The TRIS buffer system should be completely avoided when performing far-UV CD. [[Borate]] and [[Onium compounds]] are often used to establish the appropriate pH range for CD experiments. Some experimenters have substituted fluoride for chloride ion because fluoride absorbs less in the far UV, and some have worked in pure water. Another, almost universal, technique is to minimize solvent absorption by using shorter path length cells when working in the far UV, 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm path lengths are not uncommon in this work.

In addition to measuring in aqueous systems, CD, particularly far-UV CD, can be measured in organic solvents e.g. ethanol, methanol, [[trifluoroethanol]] (TFE). The latter has the advantage to induce structure formation of proteins, inducing beta-sheets in some and alpha helices in others, which they would not show under normal aqueous conditions. Most common organic solvents such as [[acetonitrile]], [[THF]], [[chloroform]], [[dichloromethane]] are however, incompatible with far-UV CD.

It may be of interest to note that the protein CD spectra used in secondary structure estimation are related to the π to π* orbital absorptions of the [[amide bond]]s linking the amino acids. These absorption bands lie partly in the ''so-called'' [[Vacuum ultraviolet#Vacuum UV|vacuum ultraviolet]] (wavelengths less than about 200&amp;nbsp;nm). The wavelength region of interest is actually inaccessible in air because of the strong absorption of light by [[oxygen]] at these wavelengths. In practice these spectra are measured not in vacuum but in an oxygen-free instrument (filled with pure [[nitrogen]] gas).

Once oxygen has been eliminated, perhaps the second most important technical factor in working below 200&amp;nbsp;nm is to design the rest of the optical system to have low losses in this region. Critical in this regard is the use of [[Mirror#Instruments|aluminized mirrors]] whose coatings have been optimized for low loss in this region of the spectrum.

The usual light source in these instruments is a high pressure, short-arc [[Xenon arc lamp|xenon lamp]]. Ordinary xenon arc lamps are unsuitable for use in the low UV. Instead, specially constructed lamps with envelopes made from high-purity synthetic [[fused silica]] must be used.

Light from [[synchrotron]] sources has a much higher flux at short wavelengths, and has been used to record CD down to 160&amp;nbsp;nm. Recently the CD spectrophotometer at the electron storage ring facility ISA at the University of [[Aarhus]] in Denmark was used to record solid state CD spectra down to 120&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= U.

In [[electromagnetism]], the '''magnetic susceptibility''' &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[latin]]: ''susceptibilis'' “receptive”&lt;/ref&gt; is one measure of the magnetic properties of a material.  The susceptibility indicates whether a material is attracted into or repelled out of a magnetic field, which in turn has implications for practical applications.  Quantitative measures of the magnetic susceptibility also provide insights into the structure of a materials, providing insight into bonding and energy levels.

==Definition of volume susceptibility==
::''See also '' [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Relative permeability and magnetic susceptibility|Relative permeability]].
Magnetic susceptibility is a dimensionless proportionality constant that indicates the degree of [[magnetization]] of a material in response to an applied [[magnetic field]]. A related term is '''magnetizability''', the proportion between [[magnetic moment]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic flux density]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1997 |title =magnetizability, ξ |encyclopedia=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology—The Gold Book |publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |edition=2nd |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/search.py?search_text=magnetizability}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closely related parameter is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], which expresses the total magnetization of material and volume.

The ''volume magnetic susceptibility'', represented by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\chi_v&lt;/math&gt; (often simply &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes &lt;math&gt;\chi_m&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;– magnetic, to distinguish from the [[electric susceptibility]]), is defined in the [[International System of Units]]&amp;nbsp;— in other systems there may be additional constants — by the following relationship:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Handley|first1=Robert C.|title=Modern Magnetic Materials|date=2000|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780471155669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{M} = \chi_v \mathbf{H}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here

:'''M''' is the [[magnetization]] of the material (the [[magnetic dipole moment]] per unit volume), measured in [[ampere]]s per meter, and

:'''H''' is the [[Effective magnetic field|magnetic field strength]], also measured in amperes per meter.

&lt;math&gt;\chi_v&lt;/math&gt; is therefore a [[dimensionless quantity]].

Using [[SI electromagnetism units|SI units]], the [[magnetic field|magnetic induction]] '''B''' is related to '''H''' by the relationship

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{B} \ = \ \mu_0(\mathbf{H} + \mathbf{M}) \ = \ \mu_0(1+\chi_v) \mathbf{H} \ = \ \mu \mathbf{H}
&lt;/math&gt;

where μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[magnetic constant]] (see table of [[physical constant]]s), and
&lt;math&gt; (1+\chi_v) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Relative permeability and magnetic susceptibility|relative permeability]] of the material.
Thus the ''volume magnetic susceptibility'' &lt;math&gt;\chi_v&lt;/math&gt; and the [[magnetic permeability]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; are related by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu_0(1+\chi_v)\,&lt;/math&gt; .
Sometimes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard A. Clarke |url=http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop/advice/coils/mu/#itns |title=Magnetic properties of materials |publisher=Info.ee.surrey.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; an auxiliary quantity called ''intensity of magnetization'' (also referred to as ''magnetic polarisation'' '''J''') and measured in [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]], is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I} = \mu_0 \mathbf{M} \,&lt;/math&gt; .
This allows an alternative description of all magnetization phenomena in terms of the quantities '''I''' and '''B''', as opposed to the commonly used '''M''' and '''H'''.

Note that these definitions are according to [[International System of Units|SI]] conventions. However, many tables of magnetic susceptibility give [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] values (more specifically [[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electromagnetic units (EMU)|emu-cgs]], short for electromagnetic units, or [[Gaussian units|Gaussian-cgs]]; both are the same in this context). These units rely on a different definition of the permeability of free space:&lt;ref name=bennett&gt;{{

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{B}^{\text{cgs}} \ = \ \mathbf{H}^{\text{cgs}} + 4\pi\mathbf{M}^{\text{cgs}} \ = \ (1+4\pi\chi_{v}^{\text{cgs}}) \mathbf{H}^{\text{cgs}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[dimensionless]] CGS value of volume susceptibility is multiplied by 4π to give the dimensionless [[International System of Units|SI]] volume susceptibility value:&lt;ref name=bennett/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_v^{\text{SI}}=4\pi\chi_v^{\text{cgs}}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] volume magnetic susceptibility of water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C is −7.19×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; which is −9.04×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; using the [[International System of Units|SI]] convention.

==Mass susceptibility and molar susceptibility==
There are two other measures of susceptibility, the ''mass magnetic susceptibility'' (χ&lt;sub&gt;mass&lt;/sub&gt; or χ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, sometimes χ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;), measured in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in SI or in cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in CGS  and the ''[[Mole (unit)|molar]] magnetic susceptibility'' (χ&lt;sub&gt;mol&lt;/sub&gt;) measured in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (SI) or cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (CGS) that are defined below, where ρ is the [[density]] in kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; (SI) or g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; (CGS) and M is [[molar mass]] in kg·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (SI) or g·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (CGS).

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_\text{mass} = \chi_v/\rho&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_\text{mol} = M\chi_\text{mass} = M\chi_v/\rho&lt;/math&gt;

==Sign of susceptibility: diamagnetics and other types of magnetism==
If χ is positive, a material can be [[paramagnetic]]. In this case, the magnetic field in the material is strengthened by the induced magnetization. Alternatively, if χ is negative, the material is [[diamagnetic]]. In this case, the magnetic field in the material is weakened by the induced magnetization. Generally, non-magnetic materials are said to be para- or diamagnetic because they do not possess permanent magnetization without external magnetic field. [[Ferromagnetic]], [[ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]], or [[antiferromagnetic]] materials have positive susceptibility and possess permanent magnetization even without external magnetic field.

==Experimental methods to determine susceptibility==
Volume magnetic susceptibility is measured by the force change felt upon a substance when a magnetic field gradient is applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early measurements are made using the [[Gouy balance]] where a sample is hung between the poles of an electromagnet. The change in weight when the electromagnet is turned on is proportional to the susceptibility. Today, high-end measurement systems use a [[superconductive]] magnet. An alternative is to measure the force change on a strong compact magnet upon insertion of the sample. This system, widely used today, is called the [[Evans balance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherwood-scientific.com/msb/msbindex.html |title=Magnetic Susceptibility Balances |publisher=Sherwood-scientific.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For liquid samples, the susceptibility can be measured from the dependence of the [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] frequency of the sample on its shape or orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ SAM_ @dreamlyf10

==Tensor susceptibility==
The magnetic susceptibility of most [[crystal]]s is not a scalar quantity. Magnetic response '''M''' is dependent upon the orientation of the sample and can occur in directions other than that of the applied field '''H'''. In these cases, volume susceptibility is defined as a [[tensor]]

:&lt;math&gt; M_i=\chi_{ij}H_j  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' and ''j'' refer to the directions (e.g., ''x'' and ''y'' in [[Cartesian coordinates]]) of the applied field and magnetization, respectively. The [[tensor]] is thus rank 2 (second order), dimension (3,3) describing the component of magnetization in the ''i''-th direction from the external field applied in the ''j''-th direction.

==Differential susceptibility==
In [[ferromagnetic]] crystals, the relationship between '''M''' and '''H''' is not linear. To accommodate this, a more general definition of ''differential susceptibility'' is used

:&lt;math&gt;\chi^{d}_{ij} = \frac{\part M_i}{\part H_j}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi^{d}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[tensor]] derived from [[partial derivative]]s of components of '''M''' with respect to components of '''H'''.
When the [[coercivity]] of the material parallel to an applied field is the smaller of the two, the differential susceptibility is a function of the applied field and self interactions, such as the [[magnetic anisotropy]]. When the material is not [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturated]], the effect will be nonlinear and dependent upon the [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]] configuration of the material.

==Susceptibility in the frequency domain==
When the magnetic susceptibility is measured in response to an [[Alternating current|AC]] magnetic field (i.e. a magnetic field that varies sinusoidally), this is called ''AC susceptibility''. AC susceptibility (and the closely related &quot;AC permeability&quot;) are [[complex number]] quantities, and various phenomena (such as resonances) can be seen in AC susceptibility that cannot in constant-field (DC) susceptibility. In particular, when an AC field is applied perpendicular to the detection direction (called the &quot;transverse susceptibility&quot; regardless of the frequency), the effect has a peak at the [[ferromagnetic resonance]] frequency of the material with a given static applied field. Currently, this effect is called the ''microwave permeability'' or ''network ferromagnetic resonance'' in the literature. These results are sensitive to the [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]] configuration of the material and [[eddy currents]].

In terms of [[ferromagnetic resonance]], the effect of an ac-field applied along the direction of the magnetization is called ''parallel pumping''.

For a tutorial with more information on AC susceptibility measurements, see [http://www.qdusa.com/resources/pdf/1078-201.pdf here (external link)].

==Sources of confusion in published data==
There are tables of magnetic susceptibility values published on-line that seem to have been uploaded from a substandard source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reade.com/Particle_Briefings/magnetic_susceptibilities.html |title=Magnetic Properties Susceptibilities Chart from |publisher=READE |date=2006-01-11 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which itself has probably borrowed heavily from the [[CRC Press|CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]. Some of the data (e.g. for Al, Bi, and diamond) are apparently in CGS '''Molar Susceptibility''' units, whereas that for water is in '''Mass Susceptibility''' units (see discussion above).  The susceptibility table in the CRC Handbook is known to suffer from similar errors, and even to contain sign errors. Effort should be made to trace the data in such tables to the original sources, and to double-check the proper usage of units.

'''Poisson's ratio''', named after [[Siméon Poisson]], also known as the coefficient of expansion on the transverse axial, is the negative ratio of transverse to axial [[strain (materials science)|strain]]. When a material is compressed in one direction, it usually tends to expand in the other two directions perpendicular to the direction of compression. This phenomenon is called the '''Poisson effect'''.  Poisson's ratio &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; ([[Nu (letter)|nu]]) is a measure of this effect. The Poisson ratio is the fraction (or percent) of expansion divided by the fraction (or percent) of compression, for small values of these changes.

Conversely, if the material is stretched rather than compressed, it usually tends to contract in the directions transverse to the direction of stretching. This is a common observation when a rubber band is stretched, when it becomes noticeably thinner. Again, the Poisson ratio will be the ratio of relative contraction to relative expansion, and will have the same value as above. In certain rare cases, a material will actually shrink in the transverse direction when compressed (or expand when stretched) which will yield a negative value of the Poisson ratio.

The Poisson's ratio of a stable, [[isotropy#Materials science|isotropic]], linear [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material cannot be less than −1.0 nor greater than 0.5 due to the requirement that [[Young's modulus]], the [[shear modulus]] and [[bulk modulus]] have positive values.&lt;ref&gt;H. GERCEK;  “''Poisson's ratio values for rocks''”;  &lt;u&gt;International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences&lt;/u&gt;;  Elsevier;  January 2007;  '''44''' (1): pp. 1–13&lt;/ref&gt; Most materials have Poisson's ratio values ranging between 0.0 and 0.5. A perfectly incompressible material deformed elastically at small strains would have a Poisson's ratio of exactly 0.5. Most steels and rigid polymers when used within their design limits (before [[Yield (engineering)|yield]]) exhibit values of about 0.3, increasing to 0.5 for post-yield deformation which occurs largely at constant volume.&lt;ref&gt;Park, RJT. ''Seismic Performance of Steel-Encased Concrete Piles''&lt;/ref&gt; Rubber has a Poisson ratio of nearly 0.5. Cork's Poisson ratio is close to 0: showing very little lateral expansion when compressed. Some materials, mostly polymer foams, and materials with special geometries such as zigzag-based materials&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unraveling metamaterial properties in zigzag-base folded sheets|url = http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/8/e1500224|journal = Science Advances|date = 2015|issn = 2375-2548|pages = e1500224|volume = 1|issue = 8|doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1500224|first = Maryam|last = Eidini|first2 = Glaucio H.|last2 = Paulino}}&lt;/ref&gt; can have a negative Poisson's ratio; if these [[auxetics|auxetic materials]] are stretched in one direction, they become thicker in perpendicular direction. Some anisotropic materials, such as zigzag-based folded sheet materials,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; have one or more Poisson's ratios above 0.5 in some directions.

Assuming that the material is stretched or compressed along the axial direction (the ''x'' axis in the below diagram):

:&lt;math&gt;\nu = -\frac{d\varepsilon_\mathrm{trans}}{d\varepsilon_\mathrm{axial}} = -\frac{d\varepsilon_\mathrm{y}}{d\varepsilon_\mathrm{x}}= -\frac{d\varepsilon_\mathrm{z}}{d\varepsilon_\mathrm{x}} &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the resulting Poisson's ratio,
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\mathrm{trans}&lt;/math&gt; is transverse strain (negative for axial tension (stretching), positive for axial compression)
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\mathrm{axial}&lt;/math&gt; is axial strain (positive for axial tension, negative for axial compression).

== Length change ==
[[Image:PoissonRatio.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 1: A cube with sides of length ''L'' of an isotropic linearly elastic material subject to tension along the x axis, with a Poisson's ratio of 0.5. The green cube is unstrained, the red is expanded in the ''x'' direction by &lt;math&gt;\Delta L&lt;/math&gt; due to tension, and contracted in the ''y'' and ''z'' directions by &lt;math&gt;\Delta L'&lt;/math&gt;.]]
For a cube stretched in the ''x''-direction (see figure 1) with a length increase of &lt;math&gt;\Delta L&lt;/math&gt; in the ''x'' direction, and a length decrease of &lt;math&gt;\Delta L'&lt;/math&gt; in the ''y'' and ''z'' directions, the infinitesimal diagonal strains are given by
:&lt;math&gt;
d\varepsilon_x=\frac{dx}{x}\qquad d\varepsilon_y=\frac{dy}{y}\qquad d\varepsilon_z=\frac{dz}{z}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating these expressions and using the definition of Poisson's ratio gives

:&lt;math&gt;
-\nu \int\limits_L^{L+\Delta L}\frac{dx}{x}=\int\limits_L^{L-\Delta L'}\frac{dy}{y}=\int\limits_L^{L-\Delta L'}\frac{dz}{z}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving and exponentiating, the relationship between &lt;math&gt;\Delta L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta L'&lt;/math&gt; is then

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(1+\frac{\Delta L}{L}\right)^{-\nu} = 1-\frac{\Delta L'}{L}.
&lt;/math&gt;

For very small values of &lt;math&gt;\Delta L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta L'&lt;/math&gt;, the first-order approximation yields:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nu \approx \frac{\Delta L'}{\Delta L}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Volumetric change ==

The relative change of volume ''ΔV''/''V'' of a cube due to the stretch of the material can now be calculated. Using &lt;math&gt;V=L^3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V+\Delta V=(L+\Delta L)(L-\Delta L')^2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta V} {V} = \left(1+\frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)\left(1-\frac{\Delta L'}{L} \right)^2-1&lt;/math&gt;

Using the above derived relationship between &lt;math&gt;\Delta L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta L'&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta V} {V} = \left(1+\frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^{1-2\nu}-1&lt;/math&gt;

and for very small values of &lt;math&gt;\Delta L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta L'&lt;/math&gt;, the first-order approximation yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta V} {V} \approx (1-2\nu)\frac{\Delta L}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

For isotropic materials we can use Lamé’s relation&lt;ref&gt;http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1204/1204.3859.pdf - Limits to Poisson’s ratio in isotropic materials – general result for
arbitrary deformation.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nu \approx \frac{1}{2} - \frac{E}{6K}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is [[bulk modulus]].{{clarify|reason=&quot;define E&quot;|date=February 2015}}

Note that isotropic materials must have a Poisson's ratio of &lt;math&gt; -1 &lt; \nu &lt; 0.5 &lt;/math&gt;.  Typical isotropic engineering materials have a Poisson's ratio of &lt;math&gt; 0.2 &lt; \nu &lt; 0.5 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;polymerphysics.net&quot;&gt;http://polymerphysics.net/pdf/PhysRevB_80_132104_09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Width change ==
[[Image:Rod diamater change poisson.svg|350px|thumb|right|Figure 2: Comparison between the two formulas, one for small deformations, another for large deformations]] 
If a rod with diameter (or width, or thickness) ''d'' and length ''L'' is subject to tension so that its length will change by ''ΔL'' then its diameter ''d'' will change by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta d = - d \cdot \nu {{\Delta L} \over L}&lt;/math&gt;
The above formula is true only in the case of small deformations; if deformations are large then the following (more precise) formula can be used:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta d = -d \cdot \left( 1 - {\left( 1 + {{\Delta L} \over L} \right)}^{-\nu} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is original diameter
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta d &lt;/math&gt; is rod diameter change
:&lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; is Poisson's ratio
:&lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; is original length, before stretch
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta L &lt;/math&gt; is the change of length.
The value is negative because it decreases with increase of length

== Isotropic materials ==

For a linear isotropic material subjected only to compressive (i.e. normal) forces, the deformation of a material in the direction of one axis will produce a deformation of the material along the other axis in three dimensions. Thus it is possible to generalize [[Hooke's Law]] (for compressive forces) into three dimensions:
:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_x = \frac {1}{E} \left [ \sigma_x - \nu \left ( \sigma_y + \sigma_z \right ) \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_y = \frac {1}{E} \left [ \sigma_y - \nu \left ( \sigma_x + \sigma_z \right ) \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_z = \frac {1}{E} \left [ \sigma_z - \nu \left ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y \right ) \right ] &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_i = \frac {1}{E} \left [ \sigma_i(1+\nu) - \nu \left ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y+\sigma_z \right ) \right ] &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_x &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_y &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_z &lt;/math&gt; are [[strain (materials science)|strain]] in the direction of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt; are [[Stress (physics)|stress]] in the direction of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis
:&lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; is [[Young's modulus]] (the same in all directions: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; for isotropic materials)
:&lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; is Poisson's ratio (the same in all directions: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; for isotropic materials)

These equations will hold in the general case which includes shear forces as well as compressive forces, and the full generalization of Hooke's law is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ij} = \frac {1}{E} \left [ \sigma_{ij}(1+\nu) - \nu \delta_{ij}\sigma_{kk} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] and

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_{kk} = \sigma_x + \sigma_y+\sigma_z = \sigma_{11} + \sigma_{22}+\sigma_{33}\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Orthotropic materials ==
{{Main|Orthotropic material}}
For [[orthotropic material]]s such as wood, [[Hooke's law]] can be expressed in [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form as&lt;ref name=Boresi&gt;Boresi, A. P, Schmidt, R. J. and Sidebottom, O. M., 1993, ''Advanced Mechanics of Materials'', Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lekh&gt;Lekhnitskii, SG., (1963), '''Theory of elasticity of an anisotropic elastic body''', Holden-Day Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \epsilon_{{\rm xx}} \\ \epsilon_{\rm yy} \\ \epsilon_{\rm zz} \\ 2\epsilon_{\rm yz} \\ 2\epsilon_{\rm zx} \\ 2\epsilon_{\rm xy}
  \end{bmatrix}
  = \begin{bmatrix}
    \tfrac{1}{E_{\rm x}} &amp; - \tfrac{\nu_{\rm yx}}{E_{\rm y}} &amp; - \tfrac{\nu_{\rm zx}}{E_{\rm z}} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\

  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_{\rm xx} \\ \sigma_{\rm yy} \\ \sigma_{\rm zz} \\ \sigma_{\rm yz} \\ \sigma_{\rm zx} \\ \sigma_{\rm xy}
  \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;{E}_{\rm i}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Young's modulus]] along axis &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G_{\rm ij}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear modulus]] in direction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on the plane whose normal is in direction &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nu_{\rm ij}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the Poisson's ratio that corresponds to a contraction in direction &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; when an extension is applied in direction &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

The Poisson's ratio of an orthotropic material is different in each direction (x, y and z).  However, the symmetry of the stress and strain tensors implies that not all the six Poisson's ratios in the equation are independent.  There are only nine independent material properties; three elastic moduli, three shear moduli, and three Poisson's ratios.  The remaining three Poisson's ratios can be obtained from the relations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\nu_{\rm yx}}{E_{\rm y}} = \frac{\nu_{\rm xy}}{E_{\rm x}}~, \qquad
\frac{\nu_{\rm zx}}{E_{\rm z}} = \frac{\nu_{\rm xz}}{E_{\rm x}}~, \qquad
\frac{\nu_{\rm yz}}{E_{\rm y}} = \frac{\nu_{\rm zy}}{E_{\rm z}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

From the above relations we can see that if &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm x} &gt; E_{\rm y}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\nu_{\rm xy} &gt; \nu_{\rm yx}&lt;/math&gt;.  The larger Poisson's ratio (in this case &lt;math&gt;\nu_{\rm xy}&lt;/math&gt;) is called the '''major Poisson's ratio''' while the smaller one (in this case &lt;math&gt;\nu_{\rm yx}&lt;/math&gt;) is called the '''minor Poisson's ratio'''.  We can find similar relations between the other Poisson's ratios.
&lt;!--
The above stress-strain relation is also often written in the equivalent ([[transpose]]d) form
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \epsilon_{{\rm 11}} \\ \epsilon_{\rm 22} \\ \epsilon_{\rm 33} \\ 2\epsilon_{\rm 23} \\ 2\epsilon_{\rm 31} \\ 2\epsilon_{\rm 12}
  \end{bmatrix}
  = \begin{bmatrix}
    \tfrac{1}{E_{\rm 1}} &amp; - \tfrac{\nu_{\rm 21}}{E_{\rm 2}} &amp; - \tfrac{\nu_{\rm 31}}{E_{\rm 3}} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    -\tfrac{\nu_{\rm 12}}{E_{\rm 1}} &amp; \tfrac{1}{E_{\rm 2}} &amp; - \tfrac{\nu_{\rm 32}}{E_{\rm 3}} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    -\tfrac{\nu_{\rm 13}}{E_{\rm 1}} &amp; - \tfrac{\nu_{\rm 23}}{E_{\rm 2}} &amp; \tfrac{1}{E_{\rm 3}} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\

 &lt;/math&gt;

== Transversely isotropic materials ==
[[Transversely isotropic]] materials have [[Transversely isotropic|a plane of isotropy]] in which the elastic properties are isotropic.  If we assume that this plane of isotropy is &lt;math&gt;y-z&lt;/math&gt;, then Hooke's law takes the form&lt;ref name=Tan&gt;Tan, S.

where we have used the plane of isotropy &lt;math&gt;y-z&lt;/math&gt; to reduce the number of constants, i.e., &lt;math&gt;E_y = E_z,~ \nu_{xy} = \nu_{xz},~ \nu_{yx} = \nu_{zx} &lt;/math&gt;.

The symmetry of the stress and strain tensors implies that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\nu_{\rm xy}}{E_{\rm x}} = \cfrac{\nu_{\rm yx}}{E_{\rm y}} ~,~~ \nu_{\rm yz} = \nu_{\rm zy} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
This leaves us with six independent constants &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm x}, E_{\rm y}, G_{\rm xy}, G_{\rm yz}, \nu_{\rm xy}, \nu_{\rm yz}&lt;/math&gt;.  However, transverse isotropy gives rise to a further constraint between &lt;math&gt;G_{\rm yz}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm y}, \nu_{\rm yz}&lt;/math&gt; which is
:&lt;math&gt;
   G_{\rm yz} = \cfrac{E_{\rm y}}{2(1+\nu_{\rm yz})} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, there are five independent elastic material properties two of which are Poisson's ratios.  For the assumed plane of symmetry, the larger of &lt;math&gt;\nu_{\rm xy}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \nu_{\rm yx}&lt;/math&gt; is the major Poisson's ratio.  The other major and minor Poisson's ratios are equal.

=== Negative Poisson's ratio materials ===

Some materials known as [[auxetic]] materials display a negative Poisson’s ratio. When subjected to positive strain in a longitudinal axis, the transverse strain in the material will actually be positive (i.e. it would increase the cross sectional area). For these materials, it is usually due to uniquely oriented, hinged molecular bonds. In order for these bonds to stretch in the longitudinal direction, the hinges must ‘open’ in the transverse direction, effectively exhibiting a positive strain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://silver.neep.wisc.edu/~lakes/Poisson.html Negative Poisson's ratio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
This can also be done in a structured way and lead to new aspects in material design as for [[mechanical metamaterials]].

== Applications of Poisson's effect ==

One area in which Poisson's effect has a considerable influence is in pressurized pipe flow. When the air or liquid inside a pipe is highly pressurized it exerts a uniform force on the inside of the pipe, resulting in a radial stress within the pipe material. Due to Poisson's effect, this radial stress will cause the pipe to slightly increase in diameter and decrease in length. The decrease in length, in particular, can have a noticeable effect upon the pipe joints, as the effect will accumulate for each section of pipe joined in series. A restrained joint may be pulled apart or otherwise prone to failure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Another area of application for Poisson's effect is in the realm of [[structural geology]]. Rocks, like most materials, are subject to Poisson's effect while under stress. In a geological timescale, excessive erosion or sedimentation of Earth's crust can either create or remove large vertical stresses upon the underlying rock. This rock will expand or contract in the vertical direction as a direct result of the applied stress, and it will also deform in the horizontal direction as a result of Poisson's effect. This change in strain in the horizontal direction can affect or form joints and dormant stresses in the rock.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geosc.psu.edu/~engelder/geosc465/lect18.rtf&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Cork material|cork]] as a stopper for wine bottles is due to cork having a Poisson ratio of practically zero, so that, as the cork is inserted into the bottle, the upper part which is not yet inserted does not expand as the lower part is compressed. The force needed to insert a cork into a bottle arises only from the compression of the cork and the friction between the cork and the bottle. If the stopper were made of rubber, for example, (with a Poisson ratio of about 1/2), there would be a relatively large additional force required to overcome the expansion of the upper part of the rubber stopper.

The NEFD can be related to a light detector's [[Noise-equivalent power]] for a collection area ''A'' and a photon bandwidth &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; by:

&lt;math&gt;NEFD = \eta \frac{NEP}{A \nu}&lt;/math&gt;, where a factor &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; (often 2, in the case of switching between measuring a source and measuring off-source) accounts for the photon statistics for the mode of operation.

'''Rot-proof''' or '''rot resistant''' is a condition of [[wikt:preservation|preservation]] or [[wikt:protection|protection]], by a process or [[Surface finishing|treatment]] of materials used in [[Industry|industrial]] [[manufacturing]] or [[Production (economics)|production]] to prevent [[biodegradation]] and [[chemical decomposition]]. [[Decomposition]] is a factor in which organic matter breaks down overtime. It is commonly caused by [[fungus]], [[mold]] or [[mildew]].

There are natural conditions where the environment is [[wikt:inhospitable|inhospitable]] to animals, bacteria and fungus, for example in high altitude and the freezing subzero [[temperature]]s of the Arctic and Antarctic, which creates a similar suspension. The proofing of materials may also prevent [[dry rot]] and wet rot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8595">'''Water-proof''' or '''water-resistant''' describes objects relatively unaffected by water or resisting the ingress of water under specified conditions. Such items may be used in wet environments or [[under water]] to specified depths. '''Waterproofing''' describes making an object waterproof or water-resistant (such as a [[camera]], [[watch]] or [[mobile phone]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/28/tech/mobile/waterproof-mobiles Waterproof mobiles make a splash - CNN.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Water resistant&quot; and &quot;waterproof&quot; often refer to penetration of water in its liquid state and possibly under pressure, whereas [[Damp proofing|''damp proof'']] refers to resistance to humidity or dampness. [[Permeation]] of [[water vapor]] through a material or structure is reported as a [[water vapor transmission rate]].

The hulls of boats and ships were once waterproofed by applying [[tar]] or [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]. Modern items may be waterproofed by applying water-repellent coatings or by sealing seams with [[gaskets]] or [[o-ring]]s.

Waterproofing is used in reference to building structures (basements, decks, wet areas, etc.), watercraft, canvas, clothing ([[raincoat]], [[waders]]) and paper (e.g., [[milk and juice carton]]s).

==Waterproofing in construction==
{{Main|Weatherization|Basement waterproofing}}
In construction, a building or structure is waterproofed with the use of membranes and coatings to protect contents as well as protecting structural integrity. The waterproofing of the [[building envelope]] in construction specifications is listed under &quot;07 - Thermal and Moisture Protection&quot; within [[MasterFormat]] 2004, by the [[Construction Specifications Institute]], and includes roofing material as well as waterproofing materials{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

In building [[construction]], waterproofing is a fundamental aspect of creating a [[building envelope]], which is a controlled environment. The roof covering materials, [[siding]], foundations, and all of the various penetrations through these surfaces need to be ''water-resistant'' and sometimes waterproof. Roofing materials are generally designed to be water-resistant and shed water from a sloping roof, but in some conditions, such as [[Ice dam (roof)|ice damming]] and on [[flat roof]]s, the roofing must be waterproof. Many types of waterproof membrane systems are available, including [[felt paper]] or [[tar paper]] with [[asphalt]] or [[tar]] to make a built-up roof, other [[bituminous waterproofing]], [[EPDM rubber]], [[hypalon]], [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[liquid roofing]], and more.

Walls are not subjected to standing water, and the water-resistant membranes used as [[housewrap]]s are designed to be breathable to let moisture escape. Walls also have [[vapor barrier]]s or [[air barrier]]s. [[Damp proofing]] is another aspect of waterproofing. Masonry walls are built with a damp-proof course to prevent [[rising damp]], and the concrete in foundations needs to be damp-proofed or waterproofed with a liquid coating, [[basement waterproofing]] membrane (even under the concrete slab floor where [[polyethylene]] sheeting is commonly used), or an additive to the concrete. A potential problem in [[earth sheltering|earth sheltered]] houses is too much humidity, so waterproofing is critical in these houses. Water seepage can lead to mold growth causing significant damage and air quality issues. Properly waterproofing foundation walls is required to prevent deterioration and seepage.

The penetrations through a building envelope need to be built in a way such that water does not enter the building, such as using [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]] and special fittings for pipes, vents, wires, etc. Some [[caulking]]s are durable, but many are not a reliable method of waterproofing.

Also, many types of [[geomembrane]]s are available to control water, gases, or pollution.

Over the past two decades, the construction industry has had technological advances in waterproofing materials, including ''integral waterproofing systems'' as well as more advanced membrane materials. Integral systems such as [[hycrete]] work within the matrix of a concrete structure, giving the concrete itself a waterproof quality. There are two main types of integral waterproofing systems: the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic systems. A hydrophilic system typically uses a crystallization technology that replaces the water in the concrete with insoluble crystals. Various brands available in the market claim similar properties, but not all can react with a wide range of cement hydration by-products and thus require caution. Hydrophobic systems use fatty acids to block pores within the concrete, preventing water passage.

Sometimes the same materials to keep water out of buildings are used to keep water in, such as [[pond liner|pond]] or pool liners.

New membrane materials seek to overcome shortcomings in older methods like [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]]. Generally, new technology in waterproof membranes relies on polymer-based materials that are extremely adhesive to create a seamless barrier around the outside of a structure.

Waterproofing should not be confused with [[roofing]] since roofing cannot necessarily withstand [[hydrostatic head]] while waterproofing can.

The standards for waterproofing bathrooms in domestic construction have improved over the years, due in large part to the general tightening of building codes.

==Waterproofing other objects==
Waterproofing techniques have been implemented in several types of objects, from different clothing products to paper packaging, cosmetics and, more recently, consumer electronics. Even though it is possible to find waterproof wrapping or other types of protective cases for electronic devices, a new technology enabled the release of diverse water-resistant smartphones and tablets in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/04/tech/mobile/waterproof-phones-tablets Waterproof phones and tablets make a splash - CNN.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This method is based on a special [[nanotechnology]] coded to be a thousand times thinner than a human hair that prevents water damage in electronics. Several manufacturers are now using the nano coating technique on their smartphones, tablets, and digital cameras.

A research paper published online on October 21, 2013, in ''[[Advanced Materials]]'', of a group of scientists at the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]'s [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], proposed that [[Nanotextured Surfaces|nanotexturing surfaces]] in the form of cones produces extremely [[water-repellent]] surfaces. These nanocone textures are &quot;super[[hydrophobic]]&quot; (extremely water-hating).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DOE/Brookhaven National Laboratory|date=October 21, 2013|title=Nano-cone textures generate extremely 'robust' water-repellent surfaces|publisher=ScienceDaily|accessdate=October 22, 2013|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com /releases/2013/10/131021131108.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Antonio|last=Checco|author2=Atikur Rahman |author3=Charles T.

'''Rustproofing''' is the prevention or delay of [[rust]]ing of [[iron]] and [[steel]] objects, or the permanent [[wikt:protection|protection]] against [[corrosion]]. Typically the protection is achieved by a process of [[surface finishing]] or treatment. Depending on mechanical wear or environmental conditions, the [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] may not be stopped completely, unless the process is periodically repeated. The term is particularly used in the [[automobile industry]].{{cn|date=January 2015}}

==Application==
===Factory===
In the factory, car bodies are protected with specially chemical formulations, typically [[phosphate conversion coating]]s. Some firms [[galvanization|galvanize]] part or all of their car bodies before the [[Primer (paint)|primer]] coat of paint is applied. If a car is [[body-on-frame]], then the frame (chassis) and its attachments must also be rustproofed. Paint is the final part of the rustproofing barrier between the body shell (apart from on the underside) and the atmosphere. On the underside, an [[underseal]] rubberized or [[PVC]]-based coating is sprayed on. These products will be breached eventually and can lead to unseen corrosion that spreads underneath the underseal. Old 1960s and 1970s rubberized underseal can become brittle on older cars and is particularly liable to this.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

===Aftermarket===
Aftermarket kits are available to apply rustproofing compounds both to external surfaces and inside enclosed sections, for example sills/rocker panels (see [[monocoque]]), through either existing or specially drilled holes. The compounds are usually wax-based and can be applied by aerosol can, brush, low pressure pump up spray (which has a reputation for mixed results),{{cn|date=May 2015}} and Shutz compressor fed spray gun which gives best results but is the most messy{{cn|date=May 2015}} - both the sprayers come with extension pipes for enclosed body sections. Shutz spray guns are much simpler and cheaper than top coat spray guns.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

An alternative for sills/rocker panels, is to block drain holes and simply fill them up with wax and then drain most of it out (the excess can be stored and reused), leaving a complete coating inside. Anti-rust wax like [[phosphoric acid]] based rust killers/neutralizers can also be painted on already rusted areas. Loose or thick rust must be removed before anti-rust wax like [[Waxoyl]] or a similar product is used. 

Structural rust (affecting structural components which must withstand considerable forces) should be cut back to good metal and new metal welded in, or the affected part should be completely replaced. Wax may not penetrate [[spot welding|spot-welded]] seams or thick rust effectively. A penetrating anti-rust product like [[WD-40]] followed by anti-rust wax can be more effective.{{cn|date=May 2015}} Application is easier in hot weather rather than cold because even when pre-heated, the products are viscous and don't flow and penetrate well on cold metal.

Aftermarket &quot;underseals&quot; can also be applied.  They are particularly useful in high-impact areas like wheel arches. There are two types - drying and non-drying. The hardening and drying products are also known as &quot;Shutz&quot; and &quot;Anti Stone Chip&quot; with similar potential problems to the original factory underseals.{{cn|date=May 2015}} These are available in black, white, grey and red colors and can be overpainted. These are best used for the area below the bumpers on cars that have painted metal body work in that location, rather than modern plastic deep bumpers. The [[bitumen]] based products not dry and harden, so they cannot become brittle, like the confusingly named &quot;Underbody Seal with added Waxoyl&quot; made by Hammerite, which can be supplied in a Shutz type cartridge labelled &quot;Shutz&quot; for use with a Shutz compressor fed gun.{{cn|date=May 2015}} Mercedes bodyshops use a similar product supplied by Mercedes-Benz.&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.mercedesclub.org.uk/archive/index.php/t-49946.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The non drying types contain anti-rust chemicals similar to those in anti-rust waxes. Petroleum based rust-inhibitors provide several benefits, including the ability to creep over metal, covering missed areas.{{cn|date=May 2015}} Additionally, a petroleum, solvent-free rust inhibitor remains on the metal surface, sealing it from rust accelerating water and oxygen. Other benefits of petroleum based rust protection include the self-healing properties that come naturally to oils, which helps undercoatings to resist abrasion caused by road sand and other debris. The disadvantage of using a petroleum based coating is the film left over on surfaces, rendering these products too messy for top side exterior application, and unsafe in areas where it can be slipped on. They also cannot be painted.

==Rate of corrosion==
The rate at which vehicles corrode is dependent upon:

*Local climate and use of [[Ice melt|ice-melting chemicals]] ([[salt]]) upon the roads
*Atmospheric pollution, such as [[acid rain]] or [[salt spray]], which can cause paint damage
*Quality, thickness, and composition of metal used, often an alloy of [[mild steel]]
*Improper use of some dissimilar metals, which can accelerate the rusting of steel bodywork through [[electrolytic corrosion]]
*Design of &quot;rust traps&quot; (nooks and crannies that collect road dirt and water)
*Particular process of rustproofing used
*Plastic/under-seal protection on the car underside
*Exposure to salt water, which strips off the protective paint and also causes rust much quicker than ordinary rain water would

==Rustproof alloys==
[[Stainless steel]], also known as &quot;inox steel&quot; does not stain, corrode, or rust as easily as ordinary steel. [[Pierre Berthier]], a Frenchman, was the first to notice the rust-resistant properties of mixing chromium with alloys in 1821, which led to new metal treating and metallurgy processes and eventually the creation of usable stainless steel. [[DeLorean DMC-12|DeLorean]] cars had stainless steel bodies.

Some cars have been made from aluminum, which may be more corrosion resistant than steel, when exposed to water but not salt or certain other chemicals.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

==History==
{{expand section|date=May 2015}}
Kurt Ziebart, an immigrant of Germany, works out of a small mechanic shop in downtown Detroit and patents rustproofing in 1959. Car body corrosion was a particular problem from the 1950s to the 1980s when car designs gradually converted to [[monocoque]] or uni-body construction, replacing a traditional separate chassis frame of thick steel. This new technology relied on shaped body panels and the integrity of the body shell for strength. Unfortunately, the application of corrosion prevention did not keep pace with spread of this new technology. Responding to widespread customer complaints, vehicle manufacturers eventually produced products more resistant to corrosion.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16097">Two physical systems are in '''thermal equilibrium''' if no heat flows between them when they are connected by a path permeable to heat.   Thermal equilibrium obeys the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]].  A system is said to be in thermal equilibrium with itself if the temperature within the system is spatially and temporally uniform.

Systems in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] are always in thermal equilibrium, but the converse is not always true.  If the connection between the systems allows transfer of energy as heat but does not allow transfer of matter or transfer of energy as work, the two systems may reach thermal equilibrium without reaching thermodynamic equilibrium.

==Two varieties of thermal equilibrium==

===Relation of thermal equilibrium between two thermally connected bodies===
The relation of thermal equilibrium is an instance of a contact equilibrium between two bodies, which means that it refers to transfer through a selectively permeable partition, the contact path.&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; For the relation of thermal equilibrium, the contact path is permeable only to heat; it does not permit the passage of matter or work; it is called a diathermal connection. According to Lieb and Yngvason, the essential meaning of the relation of thermal equilibrium includes that it is reflexive and symmetric. It is not included in the essential meaning whether it is or is not transitive. After discussing the semantics of the definition, they postulate a substantial physical axiom, that they call the &quot;zeroth law of thermodynamics&quot;, that thermal equilibrium is a transitive relation. They comment that the equivalence classes of systems so established are called isotherms.&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999). The physics and mathematics of the second law of thermodynamics, ''Physics Reports'', '''314''': 1–96, p. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal thermal equilibrium of an isolated body===
Thermal equilibrium of a body in itself refers to the body when it is isolated. The background is that no heat enters or leaves it, and that it is allowed unlimited time to settle under its own intrinsic characteristics. When it is completely settled, so that macroscopic change is no longer detectable, it is in its own thermal equilibrium. It is not implied that it is necessarily in other kinds of internal equilibrium. For example, it is possible that a body might reach internal thermal equilibrium but not be in internal chemical equilibrium; glass is an example.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), pp. 249–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

One may imagine an isolated system, initially not in its own state of internal thermal equilibrium. It could be subjected to a fictive thermodynamic operation of partition into two subsystems separated by nothing, no wall. One could then consider the possibility of transfers of energy as heat between the two subsystems. A long time after the fictive partition operation, the two subsystems will reach a practically stationary state, and so be in the relation of thermal equilibrium with each other. Such an adventure could be conducted in indefinitely many ways, with different fictive partitions. All of them will result in subsystems that could be shown to be in thermal equilibrium with each other, testing subsystems from different partitions. For this reason, an isolated system, initially not its own state of internal thermal equilibrium, but left for a long time, practically always will reach a final state which may be regarded as one of internal thermal equilibrium. Such a final state is one of spatial uniformity or homogeneity of temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]], (1897/1903), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of such states is a basic postulate of classical thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;[[László Tisza|Tisza, L.]] (1966), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This postulate is sometimes, but not often, called the minus first law of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Marsland, R. {{math|III}}, Brown, H.R., Valente, G. (2015). Time and irreversibility in axiomatic thermodynamics, ''Am. J. Phys.'', '''83'''(7): 628–634.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermal contact==

[[Heat transfer|Heat can flow]] into or out of a [[closed system]] by way of [[Conduction (heat)|thermal conduction]] or of [[thermal radiation]] to or from a thermal reservoir, and when this process is effecting net transfer of heat, the system is not in thermal equilibrium. While the transfer of energy as heat continues, the system's temperature can be changing.

==Bodies prepared with separately uniform temperatures, then put into purely thermal communication with each other==

If bodies are prepared with separately macroscopically stationary states, and are then put into purely thermal connection with each other, by conductive or radiative pathways, they will be in thermal equilibrium with each other just when the connection is followed by no change in either body. But if initially they are not in a relation of thermal equilibrium, heat will flow from the hotter to the colder, by whatever pathway, conductive or radiative, is available, and this flow will continue until thermal equilibrium is reached and then they will have the same temperature.

One form of thermal equilibrium is radiative exchange equilibrium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prevost 1791&quot;&gt;[[Pierre Prevost|Prevost, P.]] (1791). [http://books.google.fr/books?id=7ZLOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mémoire sur l'equilibre du feu. ''Journal de Physique'' (Paris), vol. 38 pp. 314-322.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Planck 1914 40&quot;&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1914), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Two bodies, each with its own uniform temperature, in solely radiative connection, no matter how far apart, or what partially obstructive, reflective, or refractive, obstacles lie in their path of radiative exchange, not moving relative to one another, will exchange thermal radiation, in net the hotter transferring energy to the cooler, and will exchange equal and opposite amounts just when they are at the same temperature. In this situation, [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation|Kirchhoff's law of equality of radiative emissivity and absorptivity]] and the [[Helmholtz reciprocity]] principle are in play.

==Change of internal state of an isolated system==

If an initially [[Isolated system|isolated]] physical system, without internal walls that establish adiabatically isolated subsystems, is left long enough, it will usually reach a state of thermal equilibrium in itself, in which its temperature will be uniform throughout, but not necessarily a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, if there is some structural barrier that can  prevent some possible processes in the system from reaching equilibrium; glass is an example. Classical thermodynamics in general considers idealized systems that have reached internal equilibrium, and idealized transfers of matter and energy between them.

An isolated physical system may be inhomogeneous, or may be composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls. If an initially inhomogeneous physical system, without internal walls, is isolated by a thermodynamic operation, it will in general over time change its internal state. Or if it is composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls, it may change its state after a thermodynamic operation that changes its walls. Such changes may include change of temperature or spatial distribution of temperature, by changing the state of constituent materials. A rod of iron, initially prepared to be hot at one end and cold at the other, when isolated, will change so that its temperature becomes uniform all along its length; during the process, the rod is not in thermal equilibrium until its temperature is uniform. In a system prepared as a block of ice floating in a bath of hot water, and then isolated, the ice can melt; during the melting, the system is not in thermal equilibrium; but eventually its temperature will become uniform; the block of ice will not re-form. A system prepared as a mixture of petrol vapour and air can be ignited by a spark and produce carbon dioxide and water; if this happens in an isolated system, it will increase the temperature of the system, and during the increase, the system is not in thermal equilibrium; but eventually the system will settle to a uniform temperature.

Such changes in isolated systems are irreversible in the sense that while such a change will occur spontanteously whenever the system is prepared in the same way, the reverse change will practically never occur spontanteously within the isolated system; this is a large part of the content of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Truly perfectly isolated systems do not occur in nature, and always are artificially prepared.

===In a gravitational field===

One may consider a system contained in a very tall adiabatically isolating vessel with rigid walls initially containing a thermally heterogeneous distribution of material, left for a long time under the influence of a steady gravitational field, along its tall dimension, due to an outside body such as the earth. It will settle to a state of uniform temperature throughout, though not of uniform pressure or density, and perhaps containing several phases. It is then in internal thermal equilibrium and even in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means that all local parts of the system are in mutual radiative exchange equilibrium. This means that the temperature of the system is spatially uniform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planck 1914 40&quot; /&gt; This is so in all cases, including those of non-uniform external force fields. For an externally imposed gravitational field, this may be proved in macroscopic thermodynamic terms, by the calculus of variations, using the method of Langrangian multipliers.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, J.W. (1876/1878), pp. 144-150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dirk ter Haar|ter Haar, D.]], [[Harald Wergeland|Wergeland, H.]] (1966), pp. 127–130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), pp. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 254-256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verkley, W.T.M., Gerkema, T. (2004).

Phys.'', '''17''': 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions between thermal and thermodynamic equilibria==

There is an important distinction between thermal and thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Münster (1970), in states of thermodynamic equilibrium, the state variables of a system do not change at a measurable rate. Moreover, &quot;The proviso 'at a measurable rate' implies that we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions.&quot; Also, a state of thermodynamic equilibrium can be described by fewer macroscopic variables than any other state of a given body of matter. A single isolated body can start in a state which is not one of thermodynamic equilibrium, and can change till thermodynamic equilibrium is reached. Thermal equilibrium is a relation between two bodies or closed systems, in which transfers are allowed only of energy and take place through a partition permeable to heat, and in which the transfers have proceeded till the states of the bodies cease to change.&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), pp. 6, 22, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

An explicit distinction between 'thermal equilibrium' and 'thermodynamic equilibrium' is made by C.J. Adkins. He allows that two systems might be allowed to exchange heat but be constrained from exchanging work; they will naturally exchange heat till they have equal temperatures, and reach thermal equilibrium, but in general will not be in thermodynamic equilibrium. They can reach thermodynamic equilibrium when they are allowed also to exchange work.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explicit distinction between 'thermal equilibrium' and 'thermodynamic equilibrium' is made by B. C. Eu. He considers two systems in thermal contact, one a thermometer, the other a system in which several irreversible processes are occurring. He considers the case in which, over the time scale of interest, it happens that both the thermometer reading and the irreversible processes are steady. Then there is thermal equilibrium without thermodynamic equilibrium. Eu proposes consequently that the zeroth law of thermodynamics can be considered to apply even when thermodynamic equilibrium is not present; also he proposes that if changes are occurring so fast that a steady temperature cannot be defined, then &quot;it is no longer possible to describe the process by means of a thermodynamic formalism. In other words, thermodynamics has no meaning for such a process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eu, B.C. (2002). ''Generalized Thermodynamics. The Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes and Generalized Hydrodynamics'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, ISBN 1–4020–0788–4, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''group velocity''' of a [[wave]] is the [[velocity]] with which the overall shape of the waves' amplitudes—known as the ''modulation'' or ''[[Envelope (waves)|envelope]]'' of the wave—propagates through space.

For example, if a stone is thrown into the middle of a very still pond, a circular pattern of waves with a quiescent center appears in the water. The expanding ring of waves is the '''wave group''', within which one can discern individual wavelets of differing wavelengths traveling at different speeds. The longer waves travel faster than the group as a whole, but their amplitudes diminish as they approach the leading edge. The shorter waves travel more slowly, and their amplitudes diminish as they emerge from the trailing boundary of the group.

[[File:Wave packet.svg|thumb|Solid line: A [[wave packet]]. Dashed line: The ''envelope'' of the wave packet. The envelope moves at the group velocity.]]
The group velocity ''v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined by the equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Dover | isbn = 978-0-486-49556-9 | last = Brillouin | first = Léon | authorlink = Léon Brillouin | title = Wave Propagation in Periodic Structures: Electric Filters and Crystal Lattices | year = 2003 | origyear = 1946 | page=75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-01045-0 | last = Lighthill | first = James | authorlink=James Lighthill | title = Waves in fluids | year = 2001 | origyear=1978 | page=242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lighthill|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hayes|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v_g \ \equiv\  \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω'' is the wave's [[angular frequency]] (usually expressed in [[radians per second]]), and ''k'' is the [[angular wavenumber]] (usually expressed in radians per meter).

The [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''ω''(''k''), which gives ''ω'' as a function of ''k'', is known as the [[dispersion relation]].

* If ''ω'' is [[proportionality (mathematics)|directly proportional]] to ''k'', then the group velocity is exactly equal to the [[phase velocity]]. A wave of any shape will travel undistorted at this velocity.
* If ''ω'' is a linear function of ''k'', but not directly proportional (''ω''=''ak''+''b''), then the group velocity and phase velocity are different. The envelope of a [[wave packet]] (see figure on right) will travel at the group velocity, while the individual peaks and troughs within the envelope will move at the phase velocity.
* If ''ω'' is not a linear function of ''k'', the envelope of a wave packet will become distorted as it travels. This distortion is directly related to group velocity, as follows. Since a wave packet contains a range of different frequencies, the group velocity ∂ω/∂k is a range of different values (because ''ω'' is not a linear function of ''k''). Therefore, the envelope does not move at a single velocity, but a range of different velocities, so the envelope gets distorted. See further discussion [[#Higher order terms in dispersion|below]].

===Derivation===
One derivation of the formula for group velocity is as follows.&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;{{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J. | title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=1995 | page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha(x,0)= \int_{-\infty}^\infty dk \, A(k) e^{ikx},&lt;/math&gt;
By the [[superposition principle]], the wavepacket at any time ''t'' is:
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha(x,t)= \int_{-\infty}^\infty dk \, A(k) e^{i(kx-\omega t)},&lt;/math&gt;
where ω is implicitly a function of ''k''. We assume that the wave packet α is almost [[monochromatic]], so that ''A''(''k'') is sharply peaked around a central [[wavenumber]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, [[linearization]] gives:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega(k) \approx \omega_0 + (k-k_0)\omega'_0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega_0=\omega(k_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega'_0=\frac{\partial \omega(k)}{\partial k} |_{k=k_0}&lt;/math&gt; (see next section for discussion of this step). Then, after some algebra,
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha(x,t)= e^{i(k_0 x - \omega_0 t)}\int_{-\infty}^\infty dk \, A(k) e^{i(k-k_0)(x-\omega'_0 t)}.&lt;/math&gt;
There are two factors in this expression. The first factor, &lt;math&gt;e^{i(k_0 x - \omega_0 t)}&lt;/math&gt;, describes a perfect monochromatic wave with wavevector &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;, with peaks and troughs moving at the [[phase velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\omega_0/k_0&lt;/math&gt; within the envelope of the wavepacket. The other factor, &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty dk \, A(k) e^{i(k-k_0)(x-\omega'_0 t)}&lt;/math&gt;, gives the envelope of the wavepacket. This envelope function depends on position and time ''only'' through the combination &lt;math&gt;(x-\omega'_0 t)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the envelope of the wavepacket travels at velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega'_0=(d\omega/dk)_{k=k_0}&lt;/math&gt;. This explains the group velocity formula.

====Higher-order terms in dispersion====
[[File:Wave disp.gif|thumb|388px|right|Distortion of wave groups by higher-order dispersion effects, for [[surface gravity wave]]s on deep water (with ''v''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;½''v''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;). The superposition of three wave components – with respectively 22, 25 and 29 meter wavelengths, fitting in a [[periodic function|periodic]] horizontal domain of 2 km length – is shown. The wave [[amplitude]]s of the components are respectively 1, 2 and 1 meter.]]
Part of the previous derivation is the assumption:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega(k) \approx \omega_0 + (k-k_0)\omega'_0&lt;/math&gt;
If the wavepacket has a relatively large frequency spread, or if the dispersion &lt;math&gt;\omega(k)&lt;/math&gt; has sharp variations (such as due to a [[resonance]]), or if the packet travels over very long distances, this assumption is not valid, and higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion become important. As a result, the envelope of the wave packet not only moves, but also ''distorts,'' in a manner that can be described by the material's [[group velocity dispersion]]. Loosely speaking, different frequency-components of the wavepacket travel at different speeds, with the faster components moving towards the front of the wavepacket and the slower moving towards the back. Eventually, the wave packet gets stretched out. This is an important effect in the propagation of signals through [[optical fiber]]s and in the design of high-power, short-pulse lasers.

=== History ===

The idea of a group velocity distinct from a wave's [[phase velocity]] was first proposed by [[William Rowan Hamilton|W.R. Hamilton]] in 1839, and the first full treatment was by [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]] in his &quot;Theory of Sound&quot; in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Brillouin |first=Léon |title=Wave Propagation and Group Velocity |publisher=Academic Press Inc. |location=New York |year=1960 |oclc=537250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other expressions ===

For light, the refractive index ''n'', vacuum wavelength λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and wavelength in the medium λ, are related by
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_0=\frac{2\pi c}{\omega}, \;\; \lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k} = \frac{2\pi v_p}{\omega}, \;\; n=\frac{c}{v_p}=\frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda},&lt;/math&gt;

with ''v''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ω''/''k'' the [[phase velocity]].

The group velocity, therefore, can be calculated by any of the following formulas:
:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{c}{n + \omega \frac{\partial n}{\partial \omega}} = \frac{c}{n - \lambda_0 \frac{\partial n}{\partial \lambda_0}} = v_p \left( 1+\frac{\lambda}{n} \frac{\partial n}{\partial \lambda} \right) = v_p - \lambda \frac{\partial v_p}{\partial \lambda} = v_p + k \frac{\partial v_p}{\partial k}.&lt;/math&gt;

==In three dimensions==
{{see also|Plane wave}}
For waves traveling through three dimensions, such as light waves, sound waves, and matter waves, the formulas for phase and group velocity are generalized in a straightforward way:&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=cC0Kye7nHEEC&amp;pg=PA239 Atmospheric and oceanic fluid dynamics: fundamentals and large-scale circulation, by Geoffrey K. Vallis, p239]&lt;/ref&gt;
:One dimension: &lt;math&gt;v_p = \omega/k, \quad v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k}, \,&lt;/math&gt;
:Three dimensions: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_p = \hat{\mathbf{k}} \frac{\omega}{|\mathbf{k}|}, \quad \mathbf{v}_g = \vec{\nabla}_{\mathbf{k}} \, \omega \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\vec{\nabla}_{\mathbf{k}} \, \omega&lt;/math&gt; means the [[gradient]] of the [[angular frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the wave vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit vector]] in direction '''k'''.

If the waves are propagating through an [[anisotropic]] (i.e., not rotationally symmetric) medium, for example a [[crystal]], then the phase velocity vector and group velocity vector may point in different directions.

== In lossy or gainful media ==

The group velocity is often thought of as the velocity at which [[energy]] or [[Physical information|information]] is conveyed along a wave. In most cases this is accurate, and the group velocity can be thought of as the [[signal velocity]] of the [[wave]]form. However, if the wave is travelling through an absorptive or gainful medium, this does not always hold. In these cases the group velocity may not be a well-defined quantity, or may not be a meaningful quantity.

In his text “Wave Propagation in Periodic Structures”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brillouin, L. |title=Wave Propagation in Periodic Structures |publisher=McGraw Hill |place=New York |year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Léon Brillouin|Brillouin]] argued that in a dissipative medium the group velocity ceases to have a clear physical meaning. An example concerning the transmission of electromagnetic waves through an atomic gas is given by Loudon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Loudon, R. |title=The Quantum Theory of Light |publisher=Oxford |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is mechanical waves in the [[solar photosphere]]: The waves are damped (by radiative heat flow from the peaks to the troughs), and related to that, the energy velocity is often substantially lower than the waves' group velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Worrall, G. |journal=Solar Physics |title=On the Effect of Radiative Relaxation on the Flux of Mechanical-Wave Energy in the Solar Atmosphere |volume=279 |pages=43–52 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/s11207-012-9982-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this ambiguity, a common way to extend the concept of group velocity to complex media is to consider spatially damped plane wave solutions inside the medium, which are characterized by a ''complex-valued'' wavevector. Then, the imaginary part of the wavevector is arbitrarily discarded and the usual formula for group velocity is applied to the real part of wavevector, i.e.:
:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \left(\frac{\partial (\operatorname{Re} k)}{\partial \omega}\right)^{-1} .&lt;/math&gt;
Or, equivalently, in terms of the real part of complex [[refractive index]] &lt;math&gt;\underline{n} = n + i\kappa.&lt;/math&gt; one has&lt;ref name=Boyd1170885&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 19965419| year = 2009| author1 = Boyd| first1 = R. W.| title = Controlling the velocity of light pulses| journal = Science| volume = 326| issue = 5956| pages = 1074–7| last2 = Gauthier| first2 = D. J.| doi = 10.1126/science.1170885}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{v_g} = n + \omega \frac{\partial n}{\partial \omega} .&lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown that this generalization of group velocity continues to be related to the apparent speed of the peak of a wavepacket.{{fact|date=August 2015}} The above definition is not universal, however: alternatively one may consider the time damping of standing waves (real &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, complex &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;), or, allow group velocity to be a complex-valued quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.860877|title=Real group velocity in a medium with dissipation|journal=Physics of Fluids B: Plasma Physics|volume=5|issue=5|pages=1383|year=1993|last1=Muschietti|first1=L.|last2=Dum|first2=C.

The above generalization of group velocity for complex media can behave strangely, and the example of [[anomalous dispersion]] serves as a good illustration.
At the edges of a region of anomalous dispersion, &lt;math&gt;v_g&lt;/math&gt; becomes infinite (surpassing even the [[speed of light in vacuum]]), and &lt;math&gt;v_g&lt;/math&gt; may easily become negative (its sign opposes &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re} k&lt;/math&gt;) inside the band of anomalous dispersion.&lt;ref name=&quot;DEWSL06&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BLSB06&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi=10.1109/JPROC.2010.2052910 |volume=98 |issue=10 |pages=1775–1786 |last1=Withayachumnankul |first1=W. |first2=B.

=== Superluminal group velocities ===

Since the 1980s, various experiments have verified that it is possible for the group velocity (as defined above) of [[laser]] light pulses sent through lossy materials, or gainful materials, to significantly exceed the [[speed of light in vacuum]] ''c''. The peaks of wavepackets were also seen to move faster than ''c''. In all these cases, however, there is no possibility that signals could be carried [[faster than light|faster than the speed of light in vacuum]], since the high value of &lt;math&gt;v_g&lt;/math&gt; does not help to speed up the true motion of the sharp wavefront that would occur at the start of any real signal.&lt;ref name=Boyd1170885/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GSBKB06&quot;&gt;{{Citation |first1=George M. |last1=Gehring |first2=Aaron |last2=Schweinsberg |first3=Christopher |last3=Barsi |first4=Natalie |last4=Kostinski |first5=Robert W. |last5=Boyd |title=Observation of a Backward Pulse Propagation Through a Medium with a Negative Group Velocity |journal=Science |volume=312 |pages=895–897 |year=2006 |doi=10.1126/science.1124524 |pmid=16690861 |issue=5775|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..895G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DEWSL06&quot;&gt;{{Citation |first1=Gunnar |last1=Dolling |first2=Christian |last2=Enkrich |first3=Martin |last3=Wegener |first4=Costas M. |last4=Soukoulis |first5=Stefan |last5=Linden |title=Simultaneous Negative Phase and Group Velocity of Light in a Metamaterial |journal=Science |volume=312 |pages=892–894 |year=2006 |doi=10.1126/science.1126021 |pmid=16690860 |issue=5775 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312..892D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SLBBJ05&quot;&gt;{{Citation |first1=A. |last1=Schweinsberg |first2=N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3649">'''Excess molar quantities''' are properties of mixtures which characterize the nonideal behaviour of real mixtures. They are the difference between the partial molar property of a component in a real mixture and that of the component in an ideal mixture. The most frequently used excess molar quantities are the excess molar volume, excess molar enthalpies and heat capacities, [[excess chemical potential]]. For volumes, internal energies and enthalpies the excess quantities are identical to the mixing quantities. They can be expressed as functions of derivatives of the activity coefficients.

==Definition==
By definition, excess properties of a mixture are related to those of the pure substances in an ideal mixture by:

:&lt;math&gt;z^E=z-\sum_i x_iz^{id}_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the pure substance, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; the excess molar property, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the specific property under consideration. From the definition of partial molar properties,

:&lt;math&gt;z=\sum_i x_i \bar{Z_i},&lt;/math&gt;

substitution yields:

:&lt;math&gt;z^E=\sum_i x_i(\bar{Z_i}-z_i^{id}).&lt;/math&gt;
For volumes, internal energies and enthalpies the excess quantities are identical to the mixing quantities. They can be expressed as functions of derivatives of the activity coefficients.

==Examples and properties==
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{V^E}_i =  \bar V_i - \bar V^{id}_i&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{H^E}_i = \bar H_i - \bar H^{id}_i&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{S^E}_i = \bar S_i - \bar S^{id}_i&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{G^E}_i = \bar G_i - \bar G^{id}_i&lt;/math&gt;

The volume of a mixture from the sum of the excess volumes of the components of a mixture is given by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
{V} = \sum_i V_i + \sum_i V_i^{E}
&lt;/math&gt;
===Relation to activity coefficients===
The excess molar volume of the component i is connected to its activity coefficient.
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{V^E}_i= RT \frac{\partial (ln(\gamma_i))}{\partial P} &lt;/math&gt;

This expression can be further processed by taking the activity coefficient derivative out of the logarithm by [[logarithmic derivative]].

&lt;math&gt; \bar{V^E}_i= RT \frac{\frac{\partial (\gamma_i)}{\partial P}}{\gamma_i} \! &lt;/math&gt;

This formula can be substituted in the definition of the excess volume.

==Derivatives to state parameters==
===Thermal expansivities===
Deriving by temperature the thermal expansivities of the components in a mixture can be related to the expansivity of the mixture:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial V}{\partial T} = \sum_i \frac{\partial V_i}{\partial T} + \sum_i \frac{\partial V_i^{E}}{\partial T}
&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently:
&lt;math&gt;
:\alpha_V V = \sum_i \alpha_{V,i} V_i + \sum_i \frac{\partial V_i^{E}}{\partial T}
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the temperature derivative of the excess molar volume
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \bar{V^E}_i}{\partial T} = R \frac{\partial (ln(\gamma_i))}{\partial P} +RT {\partial^2\over\partial T\partial P} ln(\gamma_i)&lt;/math&gt;
one can relate [[activity coefficient]]s to [[thermal expansivity]].

:''For the electrical mobility of an [[electron]] or [[electron hole|hole]] in [[solid-state physics]], see '''[[Electron mobility]]'''.''

'''Electrical mobility''' is the ability of charged particles (such as [[electron]]s or [[proton]]s) to move through a medium in response to an [[electric field]] that is pulling them. The separation of ions according to their mobility in gas phase is called [[Ion mobility spectrometry]], in liquid phase it is called [[electrophoresis]].

==Theory==
When a [[charged particle]] in a [[gas]] or [[liquid]] is acted upon by a uniform [[electric field]], it will be accelerated until it reaches a constant [[drift velocity]] according to the formula:
: &lt;math&gt;\,v_d = \mu E&lt;/math&gt; 

where 
* &lt;math&gt;\, v_d&lt;/math&gt; is the drift velocity (m/s)
* &lt;math&gt;\, E&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the applied electric field (V/m)
* &lt;math&gt;\, \mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mobility (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(Vs))

In other words, the electrical mobility of the particle is defined as the ratio of the drift velocity to the magnitude of the electric field:
: &lt;math&gt;\,\mu = \frac{v_d}{E}&lt;/math&gt;

Electrical mobility is proportional to the net [[electric charge|charge]] of the particle.  This was the basis for [[Robert Millikan]]'s demonstration that electrical charges occur in discrete units, whose magnitude is the charge of the [[electron]].

Electrical mobility of spherical particles much larger than the mean free path of the molecules of the medium is inversely proportional to the [[diameter]] of the particles; for spherical particles much smaller than the mean free path, the electrical mobility is inversely proportional to the square of the particle diameter.

==Mobility in gas phase==
Mobility is defined for any species in the gas phase, encountered mostly in [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] physics and is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{q}{m\, \nu_m}&lt;/math&gt; 

where 

*&lt;math&gt;\, q&lt;/math&gt; is the charge of the species,
*&lt;math&gt;\, \nu_m&lt;/math&gt; is the momentum transfer collision frequency, and
*&lt;math&gt;\, m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass.

Mobility is related to the species' '''diffusion coefficient''' &lt;math&gt;\, D&lt;/math&gt; through an exact (thermodynamically required) equation known as the [[Einstein_relation_(kinetic_theory)|Einstein relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{q}{k\, T}D&lt;/math&gt;,

where

*&lt;math&gt;\, k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], 
*&lt;math&gt;\, T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gas]] temperature, and 
*&lt;math&gt;\, D&lt;/math&gt; is a measured quantity that can be estimated. If one defines the [[mean free path]] in terms of [[momentum transfer]], then one gets:

:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{\pi}{8}\lambda^2 \nu_m&lt;/math&gt;.

But both the ''momentum transfer mean free path'' and the ''momentum transfer collision frequency'' are difficult to calculate. Many other mean free paths can be defined. In the gas phase, &lt;math&gt;\, \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is often defined as the diffusional mean free path, by assuming a simple approximate relation is exact:

:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{1}{2}\lambda \,v&lt;/math&gt;, 

when &lt;math&gt;\, v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[root mean square]] speed of the gas molecules: 

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt {{3\, k\, T}\over{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\, m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the diffusing species. This approximate equation becomes exact when used to define the diffusional mean free path.

==Applications==
Electrical mobility is the basis for [[electrostatic precipitation]], used to remove particles from exhaust gases on an industrial scale.  The particles are given a charge by exposing them to ions from an [[electrical discharge]] in the presence of a strong field.  The particles acquire an electrical mobility and are driven by the field to a collecting electrode.

Instruments exist which select particles with a narrow range of electrical mobility, or particles with electrical mobility larger than a predefined value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=E. O. Knutson and K. T. Whitby | title=Aerosol classification by electric mobility: Apparatus, theory, and applications | journal=J. Aerosol Sci. | year=1975 | volume=6 | pages=443–451 | doi=10.1016/0021-8502(75)90060-9 | issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former are generally referred to as &quot;differential mobility analyzers&quot;.  The selected mobility is often identified with the diameter of a singly charged spherical particle, thus the &quot;electrical-mobility diameter&quot; becomes a characteristic of the particle, regardless of whether it is actually spherical.

Passing particles of the selected mobility to a detector such as a [[condensation particle counter]] allows the number concentration of particles with the currently selected mobility to be measured. By varying the selected mobility over time, mobility vs concentration data may be obtained. This technique is applied in [[scanning mobility particle sizer]]s.

'''Rotational speed''' (or '''speed of revolution''') of an object rotating around an axis is the number of turns of the object divided by time, specified as [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm), revolutions per second (rev/s), or radians per second (rad/s). Rotational speed is equal to the [[angular velocity]] ω (or Ω) divided by 2π.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol for rotational speed is &lt;math&gt;\omega_{cyc}&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2015|reason=sub &quot;cyc&quot;?}}(the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] lowercase letter &quot;omega&quot;).

When proper units are used for [[Speed#Tangential speed|tangential speed]] ''v'', rotational speed &lt;math&gt;\omega_{cyc}&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Radial distance|radial distan]]ce ''r'', the direct proportion of ''v'' to both ''r'' and ω becomes the exact equation:&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/rotq.html&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v = 2\pi r\omega_{cyc}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v = r\omega_{rad}&lt;/math&gt;

An algebraic rearrangement of this equation allows us to solve for rotational speed:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{cyc} = v/2\pi r&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{rad} = v/r&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the tangential speed will be directly proportional to ''r'' when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same ω, as for a wheel, disk, or rigid wand. It is important to note that the direct proportionality of ''v'' to ''r'' is not valid for the [[planet]]s, because the planets have different rotational speeds (ω).

Rotational speed can measure, for example, how fast a motor is running. Rotational speed and [[angular speed]] are sometimes used as synonyms, but typically they are measured with a different unit. Angular speed, however, tells the change in [[angle]] per time unit, which is measured in [[radian per second|radians per second]] in the SI system. Since there are 2π radians per cycle, or 360 degrees per cycle, we can convert angular speed to rotational speed by:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{cyc} = \omega_{rad}/2\pi\,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{cyc} = \omega_{deg}/360\,&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\omega_{cyc}\,&lt;/math&gt; is rotational speed in cycles per second
* &lt;math&gt;\omega_{rad}\,&lt;/math&gt; is angular speed in radians per second
* &lt;math&gt;\omega_{deg}\,&lt;/math&gt; is angular speed in degrees per second

For example, a [[stepper motor]] might turn exactly one complete revolution each second.
Its angular speed is 360 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] per second (360°/s), or 2π [[radian]]s per second (2π rad/s), while the rotational speed is 60 rpm.

Rotational speed is not to be confused with [[Speed#Tangential speed|tangential speed]], despite some relation between the two concepts. Imagine a rotating merry-go-round.  No matter how close or far you stand from the axis of rotation, your rotational speed will remain constant. However, your tangential speed does not remain constant.  If you stand two meters from the axis of rotation, your tangential speed will be double the amount if you were standing only one meter from the axis of rotation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1861">'''Ion transport number''', also called the '''transference number''', is the fraction of the total current carried in an [[electrolyte]] by a given [[ion]]. Differences in transport number arise from differences in [[electrical mobility]]. For example, in a solution of sodium chloride, less than half of the current is carried by the positively charged sodium cations and more than half is carried by the negatively charged chloride anions because the chloride ions are able to move faster, i.e., chloride ions have higher mobility than sodium cations. The sum of the transport numbers for all of the ions in solution equals unity.

The concept of transport number or transference number was introduced by [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electrochem.org/dl/ma/202/pdfs/0199.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liquid junction potential|Liquid Junction Potential]] can arise due to ions in a solution having different ion transport numbers.

The Hittorf method is an experimental technique for the determination of transport numbers.&lt;ref&gt;http://corrosion-doctors.org/Dictionary/Dictionary.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For the simplest case of a solution of a single salt of univalent ions, the transport numbers are defined as the mobility of the ion divided by the sum of mobilities of the two ions. If there are more than one solutes present (e.g., an acidified sodium chloride solution or a mixture of sodium chloride and potassium bromide), every ion will have its own transport number with the sum of them being unity. In these cases, the concentrations of the ions must also be taken into account in the calculation of the transport numbers, and in the case of polyvalent ions, the charges of the ions must also be accounted for.

[[File:Torque animation.gif|frame|right|Relationship between [[force]] '''F''', torque '''τ''', [[linear momentum]] '''p''', and [[angular momentum]] '''L''' in a system which has rotation constrained in one plane only (forces and moments due to [[gravity]] and [[friction]] not considered).]]

'''Torque''', '''moment''', or '''moment of force''' (see the [[#Terminology|terminology]] below) is the tendency of a [[force]] to rotate an object about an axis,&lt;ref&gt;Serway, R. A. and Jewett, Jr. J. W. (2003). ''Physics for Scientists and Engineers''. 6th Ed. Brooks Cole. ISBN 0-534-40842-7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[lever|fulcrum]], or pivot. Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object. Mathematically, torque is defined as the [[cross product]] of the position vector of the point where the force is applied [[Euclidean vector|distance vector]] and the force vector, which tends to produce rotation.

Loosely speaking, torque is a measure of the turning force on an object such as a bolt or a [[flywheel]]. For example, pushing or pulling the handle of a wrench connected to a nut or bolt produces a torque (turning force) that loosens or tightens the nut or bolt.

The symbol for torque is typically &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the lowercase [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] ''[[tau]]''. When it is called moment of force, it is commonly denoted ''M''.

The magnitude of torque depends on three quantities: the force applied, the length of the ''lever arm''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tipler, Paul|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves, Thermodynamics (5th ed.)|publisher=W. H. Freeman|year=2004|isbn=0-7167-0809-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting the axis to the point of force application, and the angle between the force vector and the lever arm. In symbols:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \tau = \mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \|\mathbf{r}\|\,\|\mathbf{F}\|\sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the torque vector and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the torque,
:'''r''' is the position vector (a vector from the origin of the coordinate system defined to the point where the force is applied)
:'''F''' is the force vector,
:× denotes the [[cross product]],
:''θ'' is the angle between the force vector and the lever arm vector.

The [[SI units|SI unit]] for torque is the [[newton metre]] (N⋅m). For more on the units of torque, see [[Torque#Units|Units]].

== Terminology ==
{{See also|Couple (mechanics)}}

This article follows US physics terminology in its use of the word ''torque''.&lt;ref name=Hendricks&gt;''Physics for Engineering'' by Hendricks, Subramony, and Van Blerk, Chinappi page 148, [http://books.google.com/books?id=8Kp-UwV4o0gC&amp;pg=PA148 Web link]&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK and in US [[mechanical engineering]], this is called ''moment of force'', usually shortened to ''moment''.&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; In US physics&lt;ref name=Hendricks /&gt; and UK physics terminology these terms are interchangeable, unlike in US mechanical engineering, where the term ''torque'' is used for the closely related &quot;resultant moment of a [[couple (mechanics)|couple]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt;

''Torque'' is defined mathematically as the rate of change of [[angular momentum]] of an object. The definition of torque states that one or both of the [[angular velocity]] or the [[moment of inertia]] of an object are changing. ''Moment'' is the general term used for the tendency of one or more applied [[force]]s to rotate an object about an axis, but not necessarily to change the angular momentum of the object (the concept which is called ''torque'' in physics).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;''Dynamics, Theory and Applications'' by T.R. Kane and D.A. Levinson, 1985, pp. 90–99: [http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/638 Free download]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a rotational force applied to a shaft causing acceleration, such as a drill bit accelerating from rest, results in a moment called a ''torque''. By contrast, a lateral force on a beam produces a moment (called a [[bending moment]]), but since the angular momentum of the beam is not changing, this bending moment is not called a ''torque''.  Similarly with any force couple on an object that has no change to its angular momentum, such moment is also not called a ''torque''.

This article follows the US physics terminology by calling all moments by the term ''torque'', whether or not they cause the angular momentum of an object to change.

== History ==
The concept of torque, also called [[moment (physics)|moment]] or [[couple (mechanics)|couple]], originated with the studies of [[Archimedes]] on [[lever]]s. The term ''torque'' was apparently introduced into English scientific literature by [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], the brother of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Definition and relation to angular momentum==
[[File:Torque, position, and force.svg|thumb|right|A particle is located at position '''r''' relative to its axis of rotation. When a force '''F''' is applied to the particle, only the perpendicular component '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt; produces a torque. This torque '''τ'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''r'''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;'''F''' has magnitude ''τ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''r'''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&amp;thinsp;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''r'''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&amp;thinsp;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''F'''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;thinsp;sin''θ'' and is directed outward from the page.]]

A force applied at a right angle to a lever multiplied by its distance from the [[Lever|lever's fulcrum]] (the length of the [[lever arm]]) is its torque. A force of three [[newton (unit)|newtons]] applied two [[metre]]s from the fulcrum, for example, exerts the same torque as a force of one newton applied six metres from the fulcrum. The direction of the torque can be determined by using the [[right hand grip rule]]: if the fingers of the right hand are curled from the direction of the lever arm to the direction of the force, then the thumb points in the direction of the torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tord.html|title=Right Hand Rule for Torque|accessdate=2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the torque on a particle (which has the position '''r''' in some reference frame) can be defined as the [[cross product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''r''' is the  particle's [[position vector]] relative to the fulcrum, and '''F''' is the force acting on the particle. The magnitude ''τ'' of the torque is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = rF\sin\theta,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the distance from the axis of rotation to the particle, ''F'' is the magnitude of the force applied, and ''θ'' is the angle between the position and force vectors. Alternatively,
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = rF_{\perp},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt; is the amount of force directed perpendicularly to the position of the particle. Any force directed parallel to the particle's position vector does not produce a torque.&lt;ref name=&quot;halliday_184-85&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halliday|first1=David|last2=Resnick|first2=Robert|title=Fundamentals of Physics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=1970|pages=184–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It follows from the properties of the cross product that the ''torque vector'' is perpendicular to both the ''position'' and ''force'' vectors. The ''torque vector'' points along the axis of the rotation that the ''force vector'' (starting from rest) would initiate. The resulting ''torque vector'' direction is determined by the right-hand rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;halliday_184-85&quot; /&gt;

The unbalanced torque on a body along axis of rotation determines the rate of change of the body's [[angular momentum]],
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''L''' is the angular momentum vector and ''t'' is time. If multiple torques are acting on the body, it is instead the net torque which determines the rate of change of the angular momentum:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_1 + \cdots + \boldsymbol{\tau}_n = \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

For rotation about a fixed axis,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = I\boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''I''}} is the [[moment of inertia]] and '''ω''' is the [[angular velocity]]. It follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}(I\boldsymbol{\omega})}{\mathrm{d}t} = I\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\omega}}{\mathrm{d}t} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''α''' is the [[angular acceleration]] of the body, measured in rad/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This equation has the limitation that the torque equation describes the instantaneous axis of rotation or center of mass for any type of motion – whether pure translation, pure rotation, or mixed motion. {{math|''I''}} = ''Moment of inertia'' about the point which the torque is written (either instantaneous axis of rotation or center of mass only). If body is in translatory equilibrium then the torque equation is the same about all points in the plane of motion.

A torque is not necessarily limited to rotation around a fixed axis, however. It may change the magnitude and/or direction of the angular momentum vector, depending on the angle between the velocity vector and the non-radial component of the force vector, as viewed in the pivot's frame of reference. A net torque on a spinning body therefore may result in a [[precession]] without necessarily causing a change in spin rate.

=== Proof of the equivalence of definitions ===
The definition of angular momentum for a single particle is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \boldsymbol{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where &quot;×&quot; indicates the vector [[cross product]], '''p''' is the particle's [[linear momentum]], and '''r''' is the [[displacement vector]] from the origin (the origin is assumed to be a fixed location anywhere in space). The time-derivative of this is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \mathbf{r} \times \frac{d\boldsymbol{p}}{dt} + \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} \times \boldsymbol{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

This result can easily be proven by splitting the vectors into components and applying the [[product rule]]. Now using the definition of force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=\frac{d\boldsymbol{p}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; (whether or not mass is constant) and the definition of velocity &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} + \mathbf{v} \times \boldsymbol{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

The cross product of momentum &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{p}&lt;/math&gt; with its associated velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is zero because velocity and momentum are parallel, so the second term vanishes.

By definition, torque '''τ''' = '''r''' × '''F'''. Therefore, torque on a particle is ''equal'' to the
[[Derivative#Notation for differentiation|first derivative]] of its angular momentum with respect to time.

If multiple forces are applied, Newton's second law instead reads {{nowrap|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m'''a'''}}, and it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{net}} =  \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a general proof.

== Units ==
Torque has [[dimension (physics)|dimension]] force times [[distance]], symbolically {{dimanalysis|length=2|mass=1|time=−2}}. Official [[SI]] literature suggests using the unit ''[[newton metre]]'' (N⋅m) or the unit ''[[joule]] per [[radian]]''.&lt;ref name=BIPM222&gt;From the [http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-2/2-2-2.html official SI website]: &quot;...For example, the quantity torque may be thought of as the cross product of force and distance, suggesting the unit newton metre, or it may be thought of as energy per angle, suggesting the unit joule per radian.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The unit ''newton metre'' is properly denoted N⋅m or N&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=&quot;BIPM 5.1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=SI brochure Ed. 8, Section 5.1 | publisher = Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|year=2006|url=http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter5/5-1.html |accessdate = 2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This avoids ambiguity with mN, millinewtons.

The SI unit for [[energy]] or [[mechanical work|work]] is the [[joule]]. It is dimensionally equivalent to a force of one newton acting over a distance of one metre, but it is not used for torque. Energy and torque are entirely different concepts, so the practice of using different unit names (i.e., reserving newton metres for torque and using only [[joules]] for energy) helps avoid mistakes and misunderstandings.&lt;ref name=BIPM222 /&gt; The dimensional equivalence of these units, of course, is not simply a coincidence: A torque of 1&amp;nbsp;N⋅m applied through a full revolution will require an [[energy]] of exactly 2π joules. Mathematically,

:&lt;math&gt;E= \tau \theta\ &lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the energy, ''τ'' is magnitude of the torque, and ''θ'' is the angle moved (in [[radian]]s). This equation motivates the alternate unit name ''joules per radian''.&lt;ref name=BIPM222 /&gt;

In Imperial units, &quot;[[Pound-foot (torque)|pound-force-feet]]&quot; (lb⋅ft), &quot;foot-pounds-force&quot;, &quot;inch-pounds-force&quot;, &quot;ounce-force-[[inch]]es&quot; (oz⋅in) are used, and other non-SI units of torque includes &quot;metre-[[kilogram-force|kilograms-force]]&quot;. For all these units, the word &quot;force&quot; is often left out.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite web|title=CNC Cookbook: Dictionary: N-Code to PWM|url=http://www.cnccookbook.com/MTCNCDictNtoPWM.htm|accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, abbreviating &quot;pound-force-foot&quot; to simply &quot;pound-foot&quot; (in this case, it would be implicit that the &quot;pound&quot; is [[pound-force]] and not [[pound-mass]]). This is an example of the confusion caused by the use of English units that may be avoided with SI units because of the careful distinction in SI between force (in newtons) and mass (in kilograms).

Torque is sometimes listed with units that do not make dimensional sense, such as the gram-centimeter. In this case, &quot;gram&quot; should be understood as the force given by the weight of 1 gram at the surface of the earth, i.e., {{val|0.00980665|u=N}}. The surface of the earth is understood to have a standard acceleration of [[Gravity of Earth|gravity]] ({{val|9.80665|u=m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

== Special cases and other facts ==

=== Moment arm formula ===
[[File:moment arm.svg|thumb|right|Moment arm diagram]]
A very useful special case, often given as the definition of torque in fields other than physics, is as follows:
&lt;!--:''τ'' = moment arm × force--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = (\text{moment arm}) (\text{force}).&lt;/math&gt;

The construction of the &quot;moment arm&quot; is shown in the figure to the right, along with the vectors '''r''' and '''F''' mentioned above. The problem with this definition is that it does not give the direction of the torque but only the magnitude, and hence it is difficult to use in three-dimensional cases. If the force is perpendicular to the displacement vector '''r''', the moment arm will be equal to the distance to the centre, and torque will be a maximum for the given force. The equation for the magnitude of a torque, arising from a perpendicular force:

&lt;!--:''τ'' = distance to centre × force--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = (\text{distance to centre}) (\text{force}).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if a person places a force of 10&amp;nbsp;N at the terminal end of a wrench that is 0.5&amp;nbsp;m long (or a force of 10&amp;nbsp;N exactly 0.5&amp;nbsp;m from the twist point of a wrench of any length), the torque will be 5&amp;nbsp;N.m – assuming that the person moves the wrench by applying force in the plane of movement of and perpendicular to the wrench.

[[File:PrecessionOfATop.svg|thumb|right|The torque caused by the two opposing forces '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and −'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; causes a change in the angular momentum '''L''' in the direction of that torque. This causes the top to [[precess]].]]

=== Static equilibrium ===
For an object to be in [[static equilibrium]], not only must the sum of the forces be zero, but also the sum of the torques (moments) about any point. For a two-dimensional situation with horizontal and vertical forces, the sum of the forces requirement is two equations: Σ''H'' = 0 and Σ''V'' = 0, and the torque a third equation: Σ''τ'' = 0. That is, to solve [[statically determinate]] equilibrium problems in two-dimensions, three equations are used.

=== Net force versus torque ===
When the net force on the system is zero, the torque measured from any point in space is the same. For example, the torque on a current-carrying loop in a uniform magnetic field is the same regardless of your point of reference. If the net force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is not zero, and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_1&lt;/math&gt; is the torque measured from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1&lt;/math&gt;, then the torque measured from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_2&lt;/math&gt; is …
&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_2 = \boldsymbol{\tau}_1 + (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;

== Machine torque ==
[[File:Torque Curve.svg|thumb|right|Torque curve of a motorcycle (&quot;BMW K 1200 R 2005&quot;). The horizontal axis is the speed (in [[rpm]]) that the [[crankshaft]] is turning, and the vertical axis is the torque (in [[Newton metre]]s) that the engine is capable of providing at that speed.]]
Torque is part of the basic specification of an [[engine]]: the [[power (physics)|power]] output of an engine is expressed as its torque multiplied by its rotational speed of the axis. [[internal combustion|Internal-combustion]] engines produce useful torque only over a limited range of rotational speeds (typically from around 1,000–6,000 rpm for a small car). The varying torque output over that range can be  measured with a [[dynamometer]], and shown as a torque curve.

[[Steam engine]]s and [[electric motor]]s tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, with the torque diminishing as rotational speed rises (due to increasing friction and other constraints). Reciprocating steam engines can start heavy loads from zero RPM without a [[clutch]].

== Relationship between torque, power, and energy ==
If a [[force]] is allowed to act through a distance, it is doing [[mechanical work]]. Similarly, if torque is allowed to act through a rotational distance, it is doing work. Mathematically, for rotation about a fixed axis through the [[center of mass]],
:&lt;math&gt; W = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \tau\ \mathrm{d}\theta,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''W'' is work, ''τ'' is torque, and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represent (respectively) the initial and final [[angular position]]s of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;kleppner_267-68&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|first1=Daniel|last2=Kolenkow|first2= Robert|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1973|pages=267–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows from the [[work-energy theorem]] that ''W'' also represents the change in the [[Rotational energy|rotational kinetic energy]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; of the body, given by
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{r}} = \tfrac{1}{2}I\omega^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body and ''ω'' is its [[angular speed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kleppner_267-68&quot; /&gt;

[[Power (physics)|Power]] is the work per unit [[time]], given by
:&lt;math&gt; P = \boldsymbol{\tau} \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is power, '''τ''' is torque, '''ω''' is the [[angular velocity]], and ⋅ represents the [[scalar product]].

Algebraically, the equation may be rearranged to compute torque for a given angular speed and power output. Note that the power injected by the torque depends only on the instantaneous angular speed – not on whether the angular speed increases, decreases, or remains constant while the torque is being applied (this is equivalent to the linear case where the power injected by a force depends only on the instantaneous speed – not on the resulting acceleration, if any).

In practice, this relationship can be observed in [[bicycle]]s: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as [[sprockets]]) meshing with a circular [[bicycle chain|chain]], and a [[derailleur gears|derailleur mechanism]] if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. [[Single-speed bicycle#Advantages and disadvantages versus multi-speed bicycles|multi-speed bicycle]]), all of which attached to the [[bicycle frame|frame]]. A [[cyclist]], the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby [[Crank (mechanism)|cranking]] the front sprocket (commonly referred to as [[Crankset#Chainring|chainring]]). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of [[cadence (cycling)|cadence]] (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on [[Axle|spindle]] of the bicycle's [[crankset]]. The bicycle's [[bicycle drivetrain systems|drivetrain]] transmits the input power to the road [[wheel]], which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the [[gear ratio]] of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)&lt;sub&gt;input&lt;/sub&gt; pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)&lt;sub&gt;output&lt;/sub&gt; pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, [[angular frequency|angular speed]] of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.

Consistent units must be used. For metric SI units power is [[watt]]s, torque is [[newton metre]]s and angular speed is [[radian]]s per second (not rpm and not revolutions per second).

Also, the unit newton metre is [[dimensional analysis|dimensionally equivalent]] to the [[joule]], which is the unit of energy. However, in the case of torque, the unit is assigned to a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], whereas for [[energy]], it is assigned to a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]].

=== Conversion to other units ===
A conversion factor may be necessary when using different units of power, torque, or  For example, if [[rotational speed]] (revolutions per time) is used in place of angular speed (radians per time), we multiply by a factor of 2π radians per revolution. In the following formulas, ''P'' is power, τ is torque and ω is rotational speed.

:&lt;math&gt;P = \tau \times 2 \pi \times \omega&lt;/math&gt;

Showing units:

:&lt;math&gt; P / {\rm W} = \tau / {\rm (N \cdot m)} \times 2 \pi {\rm (rad/rev)} \times \omega / {\rm (rev/sec)} &lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by 60 seconds per minute gives us the following.

:&lt;math&gt; P / {\rm W} = \frac{ \tau / {\rm (N \cdot m)} \times 2 \pi {\rm (rad/rev)} \times \omega / {\rm (rpm)} } {60} &lt;/math&gt;

where rotational speed is in revolutions per minute (rpm).

Some people (e.g. American automotive engineers) use [[horsepower]] (imperial mechanical) for power, foot-pounds (lbf⋅ft) for torque and rpm for rotational speed. This results in the formula changing to:

:&lt;math&gt; P / {\rm hp} = \frac{ \tau / {\rm (lbf \cdot ft)} \times 2 \pi {\rm (rad/rev)} \times \omega / {\rm rpm}} {33,000}. &lt;/math&gt;

The constant below (in foot pounds per minute) changes with the definition of the horsepower; for example, using metric horsepower, it becomes approximately 32,550.

Use of other units (e.g. [[BTU]] per hour for power) would require a different custom conversion factor.

=== Derivation ===

For a rotating object, the ''linear distance'' covered at the [[circumference]] of rotation is the product of the radius with the angle covered.  That is:  linear distance = radius × angular distance.   And by definition, linear distance = linear speed × time = radius × angular speed × time.

By the definition of torque: torque = radius × force. We can rearrange this to determine force = torque ÷ radius. These two values can be substituted into the definition of [[Power (physics)|power]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{power} = \frac{\mbox{force} \times \mbox{linear distance}}{\mbox{time}}=\frac{\left(\frac{\mbox{torque}}{\displaystyle{r}}\right) \times (r \times \mbox{angular speed} \times t)} {t} = \mbox{torque} \times \mbox{angular speed}.&lt;/math&gt;

The radius ''r'' and time ''t'' have dropped out of the equation.  However, angular speed must be in radians, by the assumed direct relationship between linear speed and angular speed at the beginning of the derivation.  If the rotational speed is measured in revolutions per unit of time, the linear speed and distance are increased proportionately by 2π in the above derivation to give:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{power}=\mbox{torque} \times 2 \pi \times \mbox{rotational speed}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

If torque is in newton metres and rotational speed in revolutions per second, the above equation gives power in newton metres per second or watts.  If Imperial units are used, and if torque is in pounds-force feet and rotational speed in revolutions per minute, the above equation gives power in foot pounds-force per minute.  The horsepower form of the equation is then derived by applying the conversion factor 33,000&amp;nbsp;ft⋅lbf/min per horsepower:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{power} = \mbox{torque } \times\ 2 \pi\ \times \mbox{ rotational speed} \cdot \frac{\mbox{ft}\cdot\mbox{lbf}}{\mbox{min}} \times \frac{\mbox{horsepower}}{33,000 \cdot \frac{\mbox{ft }\cdot\mbox{ lbf}}{\mbox{min}} } \approx \frac {\mbox{torque} \times \mbox{RPM}}{5,252} &lt;/math&gt;

because &lt;math&gt;5252.113122 \approx \frac {33,000} {2 \pi}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

== Principle of moments ==
The Principle of Moments, also known as Varignon's theorem (not to be confused with the [[Varignon's theorem|geometrical theorem]] of the same name) states that the sum of torques due to several forces applied to ''a single'' point is equal to the torque due to the sum (resultant) of the forces. Mathematically, this follows from:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F}_1) + (\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F}_2) + \cdots = \mathbf{r}\times(\mathbf{F}_1+\mathbf{F}_2 + \cdots). &lt;/math&gt;

== Torque multiplier ==
{{Main|Torque multiplier}}
A torque multiplier is a [[gear box]] with reduction ratios greater than 1.  The given torque at the input gets multiplied as per the reduction ratio and transmitted to the output, thereby achieving greater torque, but with reduced rotational speed.

In [[physics]], '''defining equations''' are [[equation]]s that define new quantities in terms of base quantities.&lt;ref&gt;Warlimont, pp 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; This article uses the current [[International System of Units|SI system]] of [[Units of measurement|units]], not [[Natural units|natural]] or [[Nondimensionalization|characteristic units]].

==Description of units and physical quantities==

Physical quantities and units follow the same hierarchy; ''chosen base quantities'' have ''defined base units'', from these any other ''quantities may be derived'' and have corresponding ''derived units''.

===Colour mixing analogy===

Defining quantities is analogous to mixing colours, and could be classified a similar way, although this is not standard. Primary colours are to base quantities; as secondary (or tertiary etc.) colours are to derived quantities. Mixing colours is analogous to combining quantities using mathematical operations. But colours could be for [[light]] or [[paint]], and analogously the system of units could be one of many forms: such as SI (now most common), [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]], [[Gaussian units|Gaussian]], [[Imperial units|old imperial units]], a specific form of [[natural units]] or even arbitrarily defined units characteristic to the physical system in consideration ([[Nondimensionalization|characteristic units]]).

The choice of a base system of quantities and units is arbitrary; but once chosen it ''must'' be adhered to throughout all analysis which follows for consistency. It makes no sense to mix up different systems of units. Choosing a system of units, one system out of the SI, CGS etc., is like choosing whether use paint or light colours.

In light of this analogy, primary definitions are base quantities with no defining equation, but defined standardized condition, &quot;secondary&quot; definitions are quantities defined purely in terms of base quantities, &quot;tertiary&quot; for quantities in terms of both base and &quot;secondary&quot; quantities, &quot;quaternary&quot; for quantities in terms of base, &quot;secondary&quot;, and &quot;tertiary&quot; quantities, and so on.

==Motivation==

Much of physics requires definitions to be made for the equations to make sense.

'''''Theoretical implications:''''' Definitions are important since they can lead into new insights of a branch of physics. Two such examples occurred in classical physics. When [[entropy]] ''S'' was defined – the range of [[thermodynamics]] was greatly extended by associating [[Order and disorder (physics)|chaos and disorder]] with a numerical quantity that could relate to energy and temperature, leading to the understanding of the [[Second law of thermodynamics|second]] [[Laws of thermodynamics|thermodynamic law]] and [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=P.W. Atkins| title=Physical chemistry| publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=2nd| year=1978|pages=124–131| isbn=0-19-855148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the [[Action (physics)|action]] [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] (also written ''S'') (together with [[generalized coordinates]] and [[Canonical coordinates|momenta]] and the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] function), initially an alternative formulation of [[classical mechanics]] to [[Newton's laws]], now extends the range of modern physics in general – notably [[quantum mechanics]], [[particle physics]], and [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=E. Abers| title=Quantum Mechanics| publisher=Addison Wesley|edition=2nd| year=2004|page=14| isbn=978-013-146100-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Analytical convenience:''''' They allow other equations to be written more compactly and so allow easier mathematical manipulation; by including a parameter in a definition, occurrences of the parameter can be absorbed into the substituted quantity and removed from the equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson| title=Essential Principles of Physics| publisher=John Murray|edition=2nd| year=1978 | isbn=0-7195-3382-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Example

As an example consider [[Ampère's circuital law]] (with Maxwell's correction) in integral form for an arbitrary current carrying [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] in a [[vacuum]] (so zero [[magnetization]] due medium, i.e. '''M''' = '''0'''):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electromagnetism|edition=2nd|author=I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008|pages=186–188|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{l}= \mu_0 \oint_S \left ( \mathbf{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right ) \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{A} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

using the constitutive definition

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{H}, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and the current density definition

:&lt;math&gt; I = \oint_S \mathbf{J} \cdot {\rm d} \mathbf{A} , \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

similarly for the [[displacement current]] density

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}_{\rm d} = \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; leading to the displacement current &lt;math&gt; I_d = \oint_S \mathbf{J}_{\rm d} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{A} , \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{l}= \mu_0 \oint_S \mathbf{J} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{A} + \mu_0 \oint_S \mathbf{J} _{\rm d} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{A}, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_S \mathbf{H} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{l}= I + I_d,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is simpler to write, even if the equation is the same.

'''''Ease of comparison:''''' They allow comparisons of measurements to be made when they might appear ambiguous and unclear otherwise.

;Example

A basic example is mass density. It is not clear how compare how much matter constitutes a variety of substances given only their masses or only their volumes. Given both for each substance, the mass ''m'' per unit volume ''V'', or mass density ''ρ'' provides a meaningful comparison between the substances, since for each, a fixed amount of volume will correspond to an amount of mass depending on the substance. To illustrate this; if two substances A and B have masses ''m&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively, occupying volumes ''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively, using the definition of mass density gives:

:''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; / ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; , ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; / ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;

following this can be seen that:

*if ''m''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; or ''m''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; or ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;,
*if ''m''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; or ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; or ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;,
*if ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''m''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; / ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; / ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; so ''m''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; / ''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; / ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, demonstrating that if ''m''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; or ''m''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; or ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.

Making such comparisons without using mathematics logically in this way would not be as systematic.

==Construction of defining equations==

===Scope of definitions===

Defining equations are normally formulated in terms of [[elementary algebra]] and [[calculus]], [[Vector calculus|vector algebra and calculus]], or for the most general applications [[Tensor|tensor algebra and calculus]], depending on the level of study and presentation, complexity of topic and scope of applicability. Functions may be incorporated into a definition, in for calculus this is necessary. Quantities may also be [[complex number|complex]]-valued for theoretical advantage, but for a physical measurement the real part is relevant, the imaginary part can be discarded. For more advanced treatments the equation may have to be written in an equivalent but alternative form using other defining equations for the definition to be useful. Often definitions can start from elementary algebra, then modify to vectors, then in the limiting cases calculus may be used. The various levels of maths used typically follows this pattern.

Typically definitions are explicit, meaning the defining quantity is the subject of the equation, but sometimes the equation is not written explicitly – although the defining quantity can be solved for to make the equation explicit. For vector equations, sometimes the defining quantity is in a cross or dot product and cannot be solved for explicitly as a vector, but the components can.

;Examples

Electric current density is an example spanning all of these methods, [[Angular momentum]] is an example which doesn't require calculus. See the classical mechanics section below for nomenclature and diagrams to the right.

'''''Elementary algebra'''''

Operations are simply multiplication and division. Equations may be written in a product or quotient form, both of course equivalent.

:{|
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
! scope=&quot;col&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; | 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; | Angular momentum

|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
| Quotient form 
| &lt;math&gt; p = \frac{L}{r} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| &lt;math&gt; J = \frac{I}{A} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
| Product form 
| &lt;math&gt; L = pr \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; I = J A \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

'''''Vector algebra'''''

There is no way to divide a vector by a vector, so there are no product or quotient forms.

:{|
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
! scope=&quot;col&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; | 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; | Angular momentum

|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
| Quotient form 
| N/A 
| &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} = \frac{I}{A} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
| Product form 
| Starting from

&lt;math&gt; L = p r , \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

since '''L''' = '''0''' when '''p''' and '''r''' are [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or [[Antiparallel (mathematics)|antiparallel]], and is a maximum when perpendicular, so that the only component of '''p''' which contributes to '''L''' is the tangential |'''p'''| sin ''θ'', the magnitude of angular momentum ''L'' should be re-written as

&lt;math&gt; L = p r \sin \theta .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Since '''r''', '''p''' and '''L''' form a right-hand triad, this leads to the vector form

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} A = I ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} \cdot\mathbf{A} = I , \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-

'''''Elementary calculus'''''

:The arithmetic operations are modified to the limiting cases of differentiation and integration. Equations can be expressed in these equivalent and alternative ways.

===Multiple choice definitions===

Sometimes there is still freedom within the chosen units system, to define one or more quantities in more than one way. The situation splits into two cases:&lt;ref name=&quot;P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson 1978 6&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author=P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson| title=Essential Principles of Physics| publisher=John Murray|edition=2nd| year=1978|page=6| isbn=0-7195-3382-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mutually exclusive definitions:''''' There are a number of possible choices for a quantity to be defined in terms of others, but only one can be used and not the others. Choosing more than one of the exclusive equations for a definition leads to a contradiction – one equation might demand a quantity ''X'' to be ''defined'' in one way ''using another'' quantity ''Y'', while another equation requires the ''reverse'', ''Y'' be defined using ''X'', but then another equation might falsify the use of both ''X'' and ''Y'', and so on. The mutual disagreement makes it impossible to say which equation defines what quantity.

'''''Equivalent definitions:''''' Defining equations which are equivalent and self-consistent with other equations and laws within the physical theory, simply written in different ways.

There are two possibilities for each case:

'''''One defining equation – one defined quantity:''''' A defining equation is used to define a single quantity in terms of a number of others.

'''''One defining equation – a number of defined quantities:''''' A defining equation is used to define a number of quantities in terms of a number of others. A single defining equation shouldn't contain ''one'' quantity defining ''all other'' quantities in the ''same equation'', otherwise contradictions arise again. There is no definition of the defined quantities separately since they are defined by a single quantity in a single equation. Furthermore the defined quantities may have already been defined before, so if another quantity defines these in the same equation, there is a clash between definitions.

Contradictions can be avoided by defining quantities ''successively''; the ''order'' in which quantities are defined must be accounted for. Examples spanning these instances occur in [[electromagnetism]], and are given below.

[[File:Magnetic force particles.svg|thumb|200px|[[Differential (infinitesimal)|Differential]] [[magnetic force]] d'''F''' due to a small charge element d''q'' constituting an [[electric current]] ''I''  ([[conventional current]] is used). The force must be [[line integral|line-integrated]] along the path of current flow, with respect to the vector [[line element]] d'''r'''.]]

;Examples

'''''Mutually exclusive definitions:'''''

The [[magnetic field|magnetic induction field]] '''B''' can be defined in terms of [[electric charge]] ''q'' or [[Electric current|current]] ''I'', and the [[Lorentz force]] (magnetic term) '''F''' experienced by the charge carriers due to the field,

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \mathbf{F} &amp; = q \left ( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \right ) \\
&amp; = \left ( \int I \mathrm{d} t \right ) \left ( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d} t} \times \mathbf{B} \right ) \\
&amp; = \left ( \int I \mathrm{d} t \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d} t} \right ) \times \mathbf{B} \\
&amp; =  I \left ( \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \right ) \times \mathbf{B} \\
&amp; =  I \left ( \mathbf{l} \times \mathbf{B} \right ),
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{l} = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the change in position traversed by the charge carriers (assuming current is independent of position, if not so a line integral must be done along the path of current) or in terms of the magnetic flux ''Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' through a surface ''S'', where the area is used as a scalar ''A'' and vector: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = A\mathbf{\hat{n}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{n}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a unit normal to ''A'', either in differential form

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_B}{\mathrm{d}A} ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or integral form,

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \mathrm{d}A = \mathrm{d}\Phi_B  ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi_B = \int_S \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

However, only one of the above equations can be used to define '''B''' for the following reason, given that '''A''', '''r''', '''v''', and '''F''' have been defined elsewhere unambiguously (most likely mechanics and [[Euclidean geometry]]).

If the force equation defines '''B''', where ''q'' or ''I'' have been previously defined, then the flux equation defines Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, since '''B''' has been previously defined unambiguously. If the flux equation defines '''B''', where ''Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', the force equation may be a defining equation for ''I'' or ''q''. Notice the contradiction when '''B''' both equations define '''B''' simultaneously and when '''B''' is not a base quantity; the force equation demands that ''q'' or ''I'' be defined elsewhere while at the same time the flux equation demands that ''q'' or ''I'' be defined by the force equation, similarly the force equation requires Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; to be defined by the flux equation, at the same time the flux equation demands that Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined elsewhere. For both equations to be used as definitions simultaneously, '''B''' must be a base quantity so that '''F''' and Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined to stem from '''B''' unambiguously.&lt;ref name=&quot;P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson 1978 6&quot;/&gt;

'''''Equivalent definitions:'''''

Another example is [[inductance]] ''L'' which has two equivalent equations to use as a definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson| title=Essential Principles of Physics| publisher=John Murray|edition=2nd| year=1978|page=405| isbn=0-7195-3382-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electromagnetism|edition=2nd|author=I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008|pages=231–234|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of ''I'' and ''Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', the inductance is given by

:&lt;math&gt; L = N \frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_B}{\mathrm{d} I} ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in terms of ''I'' and induced emf ''V''

:&lt;math&gt; V = - L \frac{\mathrm{d}I}{\mathrm{d} t}  .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

These two are equivalent by [[Faraday's law of induction]]:

:&lt;math&gt; V = - N \frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_B}{\mathrm{d} t} , \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; V {\mathrm{d} t} = - N \mathrm{d}\Phi_B , \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

substituting into the first definition for ''L''

:&lt;math&gt; L = - V \frac{{\mathrm{d} t}}{\mathrm{d} I} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; V = - L \frac{\mathrm{d}I}{\mathrm{d} t}  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and so they are not mutually exclusive.

'''''One defining equation – a number of defined quantities'''''

Notice that ''L'' cannot define ''I'' and ''Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' simultaneously - this makes no sense. ''I'', ''Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V'' have most likely all been defined before as (''Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' given above in flux equation);

:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d} q} , \quad I = \frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d} t} ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' = work done on charge ''q''. Furthermore there is no definition of either ''I'' or ''Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' separately – because ''L'' is defining them in the same equation.

However, using the [[Lorentz force#Lorentz force law as the definition of E and B|Lorentz force]] for the [[electromagnetic field]]:&lt;ref name=Jackson20&gt;See, for example, Jackson p777-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author=J.A. Wheeler, C. Misner, K.S. Thorne|publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|pages=72–73|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}. These authors use the Lorentz force in tensor form as definer of the [[electromagnetic tensor]] ''F'', in turn the fields '''E''' and '''B'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electromagnetism|edition=2nd|author=I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008|page=122|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = q \left [ \mathbf{E} + \left ( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \right )\right ] ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

as a single defining equation for the [[electric field]] '''E''' and magnetic field '''B''' is allowed, since '''E''' and '''B''' are not only defined by one variable, but ''three''; force '''F''', velocity '''v''' and charge ''q''. This is consistent with isolated definitions of '''E''' and '''B''' since '''E''' is defined using '''F''' and ''q'':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{F}/q .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and '''B''' defined by '''F''', '''v''', and ''q'', as given above.

==Limitations of definitions==

'''''Definitions vs. functions:''''' Defining quantities can vary as a function of parameters other than those in the definition. A defining equation only defines how calculate the defined quantity, it ''cannot'' describe how the quantity varies as a function of other parameters since the function would vary from one application to another.

;Examples

Mass density ''ρ'' is defined using mass ''m'' and volume ''V'' by but can vary as a function of temperature ''T'' and pressure ''p'', ''ρ'' = ''ρ''(''p'', ''T'')

The [[angular frequency]] ''ω'' of [[wave propagation]] is defined using the [[frequency]] (or equivalently time period ''T'') of the oscillation, as a function of [[wavenumber]] ''k'', ''ω'' = ''ω''(''k''). This is the ''[[dispersion relation]]'' for wave propagation.

The [[coefficient of restitution]] for an object colliding is defined using the speeds of separation and  approach with respect to the collision point, but depends on the nature of the surfaces in question.

'''''Definitions vs. theorems''''': There is a very important difference between defining equations and general or derived results, theorems or laws. Defining equations ''do '''not''' find out '''any''' information'' about a physical system, they simply re-state one measurement in terms of others. Results, theorems, and laws, on the other hand ''do'' provide meaningful information, if only a little, since they represent a calculation for a quantity given other properties of the system, and describe how the system behaves as variables are changed.

;Examples

An example was given above for Ampere's law. Another is the conservation of momentum for ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; initial particles having initial momenta '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; where ''i'' = 1, 2 ... ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; final particles having final momenta '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (some particles may explode or adhere) where ''j'' = 1, 2 ... ''N''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the equation  of conservation reads:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_i^{N_1}\mathbf{p}_{\rm i} = \sum_j^{N_2}\mathbf{p}_{\rm j} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of momentum in terms of velocity:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{v} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

so that for each particle:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p}_{\rm i} = m_i \mathbf{v}_{\rm i} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p}_{\rm j} = m_j \mathbf{v}_{\rm j} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the conservation equation can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_i^{N_1}m_i \mathbf{v}_{\rm i} = \sum_j^{N_2} m_i \mathbf{v}_{\rm i} .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

It is identical to the previous version. No information is lost or gained by changing quantities when definitions are substituted, but the equation itself does give information about the system.

==One-off definitions==

Some equations, typically results from a derivation, include useful quantities which serve as a one-off definition within its scope of application.

;Examples

In [[special relativity]], [[Mass in special relativity#The relativistic mass concept|relativistic mass]] has support and detraction by physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=H.D. Young, R.A. Freedman| title=University Physics – With Modern Physics| publisher=Addison-Wesley (Pearson International)|edition=12th|pages=1290–1291|year=2008| isbn=0-321-50130-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; m = \gamma m_0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[rest mass]] of the object and γ is the [[Lorentz factor]]. This makes some quantities such as momentum '''p''' and energy ''E'' of a massive object in motion easy to obtain from other equations simply by using relativistic mass:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v} \rightarrow \mathbf{p} = \gamma m_0 \mathbf{v} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; E = mc^2 \rightarrow E = \gamma m_0 c^2 &lt;/math&gt;

However, this does ''not'' always apply, for instance the [[kinetic energy]] ''T'' and [[force]] '''F''' of the same object is ''not'' given by:

:&lt;math&gt; T = \frac{m}{2}\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v} \nrightarrow T = \frac{\gamma m_0}{2}\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a} \nrightarrow \mathbf{F} = \gamma m_0 \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

The Lorentz factor has a deeper significance and origin, and is used in terms of [[proper time]] and [[coordinate time]] with [[four-vector]]s. The correct equations above are consequence of the applying definitions in the correct order.

[[File:Magnetic deflection helical path.svg|thumb|right|300px|''300px''|Magnetic field deflecting a charged particle, pseudo-defining '''magnetic rigidity''' for the particle.]]

In electromagnetism, a [[charged particle]] (of mass ''m'' and charge ''q'') in a uniform magnetic field '''B''' is deflected by the field in a circular helical arc at velocity '''v''' and [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] '''r''', where the helical trajectory inclined at an angle ''θ'' to '''B'''. The [[magnetic force]] is the [[centripetal force]], so the force '''F''' acting on the particle is;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = - \frac{m \left ( \mathbf{v}\cdot{\mathbf{v}} \right ) \mathbf{\hat{r}} }{\left | \mathbf{r} \right |} = q \left ( \mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}\right ),\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

reducing to scalar form and solving for |'''B'''||'''r'''|;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{m \left | \mathbf{v} \right |^2 }{\left | \mathbf{r} \right |} = q \left | \mathbf{v} \right | \left | \mathbf{B} \right | \sin \theta, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{m \left | \mathbf{v} \right | }{\left | \mathbf{r} \right |} = q \left | \mathbf{B} \right | \sin \theta, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \left | \mathbf{B} \right | \left | \mathbf{r} \right | = \frac{m \left | \mathbf{v} \right | }{ q \sin \theta} , \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

serves as the definition for the '''magnetic rigidity''' of the particle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electromagnetism|edition=2nd|author=I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Since this depends on the mass and charge of the particle, it is useful for determining the extent a particle deflects in a '''B''' field, which occurs experimentally in [[mass spectrometry]] and [[particle detector]]s.

[[Physical properties]] of materials and [[system]]s are often described as '''intensive and extensive properties'''. This classification relates to the dependency of the properties upon the size or extent of the system or object in question.

The distinction is based on the concept that smaller, non-interacting identical subdivisions of the system may be identified so that the property of interest does or does not change when the system is divided or combined.

An '''intensive property''' is a '''bulk property''', meaning that it is a [[physical property]] of a system that does not depend on the system size or the amount of material in the system. Examples of intensive properties include temperature, refractive index, density, and hardness of an object. When a diamond is cut, the pieces maintain their intrinsic hardness (until their size reaches a few atoms thick).

By contrast, an '''extensive property''' is additive for independent, non-interacting subsystems.&lt;ref name=IUPAC&gt;[http://media.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/IUPAC-GB3-2ndPrinting-Online-22apr2011.pdf IUPAC Green Book] Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry (3rd edn. 2007), page 6 (page 20 of 250 in PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; The property is proportional to the amount of material in the system. For example, both the mass and the volume of a diamond are directly proportional to the amount that is left after cutting it from the raw mineral.  Mass and volume are extensive properties, but hardness is intensive.

The ratio of two extensive properties of the same object or system is scale-invariant, and is therefore an intensive property. For example, the ratio of the extensive properties mass and volume, the density, is an intensive property.

This terminology of intensive and extensive properties was introduced by [[Richard C. Tolman]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=Redlich/&gt;

==Intensive properties==
An intensive property is a [[physical quantity]] whose value does not depend on the amount of the substance for which it is measured. For example, the [[temperature]] of a system in thermal equilibrium is the same as the temperature of any part of it. If the system is divided the temperature of each subsystem is identical. The same applies to the [[density]] of a homogeneous system; if the system is divided in half, the mass and the volume change in the identical ratio and the density remains unchanged. Additionally, the boiling point of a substance is another example of an intensive property. For example, the boiling point for water is 100&amp;nbsp;°C at a pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]], which remains true regardless of quantity.

According to the [[state postulate]], a sufficiently simple thermodynamic system requires only two independent intensive variables to fully specify the system's entire state.  Other intensive properties are derived from the two known values.

Some intensive properties, such as [[viscosity]], are [[empirical]] [[macroscopic]] [[quantity|quantities]] &lt;!-- was: &quot;statistical in nature&quot; --&gt; and are not relevant to extremely small systems.

===Combined intensive properties===
There are four properties in any thermodynamic system, two are intensive and two are extensive.

If the set of parameters, &lt;math&gt;\{a_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, are intensive properties and another set, &lt;math&gt;\{A_j\}&lt;/math&gt;, are extensive properties, then the function &lt;math&gt;F(\{a_i\},\{A_j\})&lt;/math&gt; is an intensive property if for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;F(\{a_i\},\{\alpha A_j\}) = F(\{a_i\},\{A_j\}).\,&lt;/math&gt;

It follows, for example, that the [[ratio]] of two extensive properties is an intensive property - density (intensive) is equal to mass (extensive) divided by volume (extensive).

===Examples===
Examples of intensive properties include:
{{colbegin|3}}
* [[chemical potential]]
* [[concentration]]
* [[density]]  (or [[specific gravity]])
* [[ductility]]
* [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]
* [[electrical resistivity]]
* [[hardness]]
* [[magnetic field]]
* [[magnetization]]
* [[malleability]]
* [[melting point]] and [[boiling point]]

* [[specific energy]]
* [[specific heat capacity]]
* [[specific volume]]
* spectral absorption maxima (in [[solution]])

==Extensive properties==
The [[IUPAC Green Book]] defines an extensive property as a physical quantity that is the sum of the properties of separate non-interacting subsystems that compose the entire system.&lt;ref name=IUPAC/&gt; The value of such an additive property is proportional to the size of the [[system]] it describes, or to the quantity of matter in the system. Taking on the example of melting ice, the amount of heat required to melt ice is an extensive property. The amount of heat required to melt one ice cube would be much less than the amount of heat required to melt an iceberg, so it is dependent on the quantity.

Extensive properties are the counterparts of intensive properties, which are intrinsic to a particular subsystem. Dividing one type of extensive property by a different type of extensive property generally gives an intensive value—for example: [[mass]] (extensive) divided by [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] (extensive) gives [[density]] (intensive).

===Combined extensive properties===
If a set of parameters &lt;math&gt;\{a_i\}&lt;/math&gt; are intensive properties and another set &lt;math&gt;\{A_j\}&lt;/math&gt; are extensive properties, then the function &lt;math&gt;F(\{a_i\},\{A_j\})&lt;/math&gt; is an extensive property if for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;F(\{a_i\},\{\alpha A_j\})=\alpha F(\{a_i\},\{A_j\}).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, extensive properties are [[homogeneous function]]s (of degree 1) with respect to &lt;math&gt;\{A_j\}&lt;/math&gt;. It follows from [[Euler's homogeneous function theorem]] that

:&lt;math&gt;F(\{a_i\},\{A_j\})=\sum_j A_j \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial A_j}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[partial derivative]] is taken with all parameters constant except &lt;math&gt;A_j&lt;/math&gt;. The converse is also true: any function that obeys the above relationship is extensive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

{{see also|List of thermodynamic properties}}
Although not true for all physical properties, some properties have corresponding extensive and intensive analogs, many of which are [[Thermodynamic property|thermodynamic properties]].  Examples of such extensive thermodynamic properties, that are dependent on the size of the [[thermodynamic system]] in question, include volume, internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy, Helmholtz free energy, and heat capacity (in the sense of [[thermal mass]]).  The symbols of these extensive thermodynamic properties shown here are [[capital letter]]s.

For homogeneous substances, these extensive thermodynamic properties each have corresponding intensive thermodynamic properties, which are expressed on a per mass or volume basis. The name is usually prefixed with the adjective ''specific'' to indicate that they are bulk properties, valid at any location (smaller subdivision) in a thermodynamic system. They may be dependent on other conditions at any point, such as temperature, pressure, and material composition, but are not considered dependent on the size of a thermodynamic system or on the amount of material in the system.

Specific volume is volume per mass—the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of [[density]], which equals mass per volume.

If a molecular weight can be assigned for the substance, or the amount of substance (in [[Mole (chemistry)|moles]]) can be determined, then each of these thermodynamic properties may be expressed on a molar basis, and their name may be qualified with the adjective ''molar'', yielding terms such as molar volume, molar internal energy, molar enthalpy, molar entropy. Standards for the symbols of molar quantities do not exist.  A well known molar volume is that of an [[ideal gas]] at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]], with the value {{gaps|22.41|[[liter]]s/mol}}. Molar Gibbs free energy is commonly referred to as [[chemical potential]], symbolized by μ, particularly when discussing a partial molar Gibbs free energy μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; for a component i in a mixture.

==Generality of classification==

The general validity of the division of physical properties into extensive and intensive kinds has been addressed in the course of science.&lt;ref name=Hatsopoulos&gt;Hatsopoulos G.N. and Keenan J.H. ''Principles of general thermodynamics'', John Wiley and Sons 1965 p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Redlich|Redlich]] noted that physical properties and especially thermodynamic properties are most conveniently defined as either intensive or extensive,&lt;ref name=Redlich&gt;O. Redlich, Journal of chemical education, 47, 154-156 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; however, these two categories are not all-inclusive and some well-defined physical properties conform to neither definition. Redlich also provides examples of mathematical functions that alter the strict additivity relationship for extensive system, such as the square or square root of volume, which occur in some contexts, albeit rarely used.&lt;ref name=Redlich/&gt;

Other systems, for which standard definitions do not provide a simple answer, are systems in which the subsystems interact when combined. Redlich pointed out that the assignment of some properties as intensive or extensive may depend on the way subsystems are arranged. For example, if two identical [[galvanic cell]]s are connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]], the [[voltage]] of the system is equal to the voltage of each cell, while the [[electric charge]] transferred (or the [[electric current]]) is extensive. However if the same cells are connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]], the charge becomes intensive and the voltage extensive.&lt;ref name=Redlich/&gt; The IUPAC definitions do not consider such cases.&lt;ref name=IUPAC/&gt;

'''Luminance''' is a [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] measure of the  [[luminous intensity]] per unit area of [[light]] travelling in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through, is emitted or reflected from a particular area, and falls within a given [[solid angle]]. The [[SI]] unit for luminance is [[candela per square metre]] (cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). A non-SI term for the same unit is the &quot;nit&quot;. The [[CGS]] unit of luminance is the [[stilb (luminance)|stilb]], which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10&amp;nbsp;kcd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Explanation==
Luminance is often used to characterize emission or reflection from flat, [[diffuse reflection|diffuse]] surfaces. The luminance indicates how much [[luminous flux|luminous power]] will be detected by an [[Human eye|eye]] looking at the surface from a particular angle of view. Luminance is thus an indicator of how [[brightness|bright]] the surface will appear. In this case, the solid angle of interest is the solid angle subtended by the eye's [[pupil]]. Luminance is used in the video industry to characterize the brightness of displays. A typical computer display emits between 50 and {{val|300|u=cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The sun has luminance of about {{val|1.6|e=9|u=cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} at noon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schorsch.com/kbase/glossary/luminance.html |title=Luminance |work=Lighting Design Glossary |accessdate=Apr 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luminance is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] in [[geometric optics]]. This means that for an ideal optical system, the luminance at the output is the same as the input luminance. For real, passive, optical systems, the output luminance is ''at most'' equal to the input. As an example, if one uses a lens to form an image that is smaller than the source object, the luminous power is concentrated into a smaller area, meaning that the [[illuminance]] is higher at the image. The light at the image plane, however, fills a larger solid angle so the luminance comes out to be the same assuming there is no loss at the lens. The image can never be &quot;brighter&quot; than the source.

== Definition ==
[[Image:Etendue-Free space.png|right|thumb|300px|Parameters for defining the luminance.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
L_\mathrm{v} = \frac{\mathrm{d}^2\Phi_\mathrm{v}}
    {\mathrm{d}\Sigma\,\mathrm{d}\Omega_\Sigma \cos \theta_\Sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{var|L}}&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the luminance ([[candela|cd]]/[[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]),
* d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{var|Φ}}&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is is the [[luminous flux]] ([[Lumen (unit)|lm]]) leaving the area d{{var|Σ}} in any direction contained inside the solid angle d{{var|Ω}}&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt;,
* d{{var|Σ}} is an [[infinitesimal]] area ([[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]) of the source containing the specified point,
* d{{var|Ω}}&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt; is an infinitesimal [[solid angle]] ([[Steradian|sr]]) containing the specified direction,
* {{var|θ}}&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[angle]] between the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] '''n'''&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt; to the surface d{{var|Σ}} and the specified direction.

If light travels through a lossless medium, the luminance does not change along a given light ray. As the ray crosses an arbitrary surface ''S'', the luminance is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
L_\mathrm{v} = \frac{\mathrm{d}^2\Phi_\mathrm{v}}
    {\mathrm{d}S\,\mathrm{d}\Omega_S \cos \theta_S}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* d{{var|S}} is the infinitesimal area of ''S'' seen from the source inside the solid angle d{{var|Ω}}&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt;,
* d{{var|Ω}}&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the infinitesimal solid angle [[Subtended angle|subtended]] by d{{var|Σ}} as seen from d{{var|S}},
* {{var|θ}}&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the angle between the normal '''n'''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; to d{{var|S}} and the direction of the light.

More generally, the luminance along a light ray can be defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
L_\mathrm{v} = n^2\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{v}}{\mathrm{d}G}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* d{{var|G}} is the [[etendue]] of an infinitesimally narrow beam containing the specified ray,
* d{{var|Φ}}&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the luminous flux carried by this beam,
* {{var|n}} is the [[index of refraction]] of the medium.

==Units==
A variety of units have been used for luminance, besides the candela per square metre.

One candela per square metre is equal to:
*10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; [[stilb (unit)|stilbs]] (the [[CGS]] unit of luminance)
*&amp;pi; [[apostilb]]s
*&amp;pi;×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; [[lambert (unit)|lambert]]s
*0.292 [[foot-lambert]]s

==Health effects==
{{see also|Laser safety}}
Retinal damage can occur when the eye is exposed to high luminance. Damage can occur due to local heating of the retina. Photochemical effects can also cause damage, especially at short wavelengths.

{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Electrostatics}}

The '''electric field''' is a component of the [[electromagnetic field]]. It is a [[vector field]] and is generated by [[electric charges]] or time-varying [[magnetic fields]], as described by [[Maxwell's equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Feynman |title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol II |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-201-02115-8 |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_04.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of an electric field was introduced by [[Michael Faraday]].&lt;ref&gt;http://public.wsu.edu/~jtd/Physics206/michael_faraday.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

The electric field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; at a given point is defined as the (vectorial) force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; that would be exerted on a stationary [[test particle]] of unit charge by electromagnetic forces (i.e. the [[Lorentz force]]). A particle of [[electric charge|charge]] &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; would be subject to a force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=q\cdot\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;.

Its [[SI]] units are [[newton (unit)|newton]]s per [[coulomb]] (N⋅C&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) or, equivalently, [[volt]]s per [[metre]] (V⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), which in terms of [[SI base unit]]s are kg⋅m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;⋅A&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Sources of electric field==

===Causes and description===

Electric fields are caused by [[electric charges]] or varying [[magnetic fields]]. The former effect is described by [[Gauss's law]], the latter by [[Faraday's law of induction]], which together are enough to define the behavior of the electric field as a function of charge repartition and magnetic field. However, since the magnetic field is described as a function of electric field, the equations of both fields are coupled and together form [[Maxwell's equations]] that describe both fields as a function of charges and [[Electric current|currents]].

In the special case of a [[steady state]] (stationary charges and currents), the Maxwell-Faraday inductive effect disappears. The resulting two equations (Gauss's law &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt; and Faraday's law with no induction term &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0&lt;/math&gt;), taken together, are equivalent to [[Coulomb's law#Electric field|Coulomb's law]], written as &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{E}(\boldsymbol{r}) = {1\over 4\pi\varepsilon_0}\int d\boldsymbol{r'} \rho(\boldsymbol{r'}) {\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r'} \over |\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r'}|^3}&lt;/math&gt; for a [[charge density]]
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\rho}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the position in space). Notice that &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;, the [[permittivity]] of vacuum, must be substituted if charges are considered in non-empty media.

===Continuous vs. discrete charge repartition===

{{Main|Charge density}}

The equations of electromagnetism are best described in a continuous description. However, charges are sometimes best described as discrete points; for example, some models may describe [[electrons]] as punctual sources where charge density is infinite on an infinitesimal section of space.

A charge &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; located in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r_0}&lt;/math&gt; can be described mathematically as a charge density &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r})=q\delta(\mathbf{r-r_0})&lt;/math&gt;, where the [[Dirac delta function]] (in three dimensions) is used. Conversely, a charge distribution can be approximated by many  small punctual charge.

==Superposition principle==

Electric fields satisfy the [[superposition principle]], because [[Maxwell's equations]] are [[Linear differential equation|linear]]. As a result, if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_2&lt;/math&gt; are the electric fields resulting from distribution of charges &lt;math&gt;\rho_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_2&lt;/math&gt;, a distribution of charges &lt;math&gt;\rho_1+\rho_2&lt;/math&gt; will create an electric field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_1+\mathbf{E}_2&lt;/math&gt;; for instance, [[Coulomb's law]] is linear in charge density as well.

This principle is useful to calculate the field created by multiple point charges. If charges &lt;math&gt;q_1, q_2, ..., q_n&lt;/math&gt; are stationary in space at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,...\mathbf{r}_n&lt;/math&gt;, in the absence of currents, the superposition principle proves that the resulting field is the sum of fields generated by each particle as described by [[Coulomb's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{E}_i(\mathbf{r}) =
\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \sum_{i=1}^N q_i \frac{\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_i}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_i|^3}&lt;/math&gt;

==Electrostatic fields==

{{Main|Electrostatics}}

[[Image:VFPt charges plus minus thumb.svg|220px|thumb|right|Illustration of the electric field surrounding a positive (red) and a negative (blue) charge.]]
[[File:Electrical potential and field lines between two wires.png|thumb|Electric field between two conductors]]

Electrostatic fields are '''E'''-fields which do not change with time, which happens when charges and currents are stationary. In that case, [[Coulomb's law]] fully describes the field.

===Electric potential===
{{Main|Conservative vector field#Irrotational vector fields}}

By Faraday's law, the electric field has zero curl. One can then define an [[electric potential]], that is, a function &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} = -\nabla \Phi &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://physicspages.com/2011/10/08/curl-potential-in-electrostatics/&lt;/ref&gt;
This is analogous to the [[gravitational potential]].

===Parallels between electrostatic and gravitational fields===
[[Coulomb's law]], which describes the interaction of electric charges:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F}=q\left(\frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{\mathbf{\hat{r}}}{|\mathbf{r}|^2}\right)=q\mathbf{E}
&lt;/math&gt;

is similar to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{F}=m\left(-GM\frac{\mathbf{\hat{r}}}{|\mathbf{r}|^2}\right)=m\mathbf{g}
&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}}=\mathbf{\frac{r}{|r|}}&lt;/math&gt;).

This suggests similarities between the electric field '''E''' and the gravitational field '''g''', or their associated potentials. Mass is sometimes called &quot;gravitational charge&quot; because of that similarity.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Electrostatic and gravitational forces both are [[central force|central]], [[conservative force|conservative]] and obey an [[inverse-square law]].

===Uniform fields===

A uniform field is one in which the electric field is constant at every point. It can be approximated by placing two conducting [[Capacitor#Parallel-plate model|plates]] parallel to each other and maintaining a [[voltage]] (potential difference) between them; it is only an approximation because of boundary effects (near the edge of the planes, electric field is distorted because the plane does not continue). Assuming infinite planes, the magnitude of the electric field ''E'' is:

:&lt;math&gt; E = - \frac{\Delta\phi}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

where Δ''ϕ'' is the [[potential difference]] between the plates and ''d'' is the distance separating the plates. The negative sign arises as positive charges repel, so a positive charge will experience a force away from the positively charged plate, in the opposite direction to that in which the voltage increases. In micro- and nanoapplications, for instance in relation to semiconductors, a typical magnitude of an electric field is in the order of {{val|e=6|u=V⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, achieved by applying a voltage of the order of 1 volt between conductors spaced 1&amp;nbsp;µm apart.

==Electrodynamic fields==

{{Main|Electrodynamics}}

Electrodynamic fields are '''E'''-fields which do change with time, for instance when charges are in motion.

The electric field cannot be described independently of the magnetic field in that case. If '''A''' is the [[magnetic vector potential]], defined so that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;, one can still define an electric potential &lt;math&gt; \Phi&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} = - \nabla \Phi - \frac { \partial \mathbf{A} } { \partial t }&lt;/math&gt;

One can recover [[Faraday's law of induction]] by taking the curl of that equation
:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Maxwell's Equations
|first1=Paul G.
|last1=Huray
|publisher=Wiley-IEEE
|year=2009
|isbn=0-470-54276-4
|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0QsDgdd0MhMCp
|page= 205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial (\nabla \times \mathbf{A})} {\partial t}=
-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

which justifies, a posteriori, the previous form for '''E'''.

==Energy in the electric field==

If the magnetic field '''B''' is nonzero,

The total energy per unit volume stored by the electromagnetic field is&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition), D.J. Griffiths, Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley, 2007, ISBN 81-7758-293-3&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; u_{EM} = \frac{\varepsilon}{2}  |\mathbf{E}|^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu} |\mathbf{B}|^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε'' is the [[permittivity]] of the medium in which the field exists, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; its [[magnetic permeability]], and '''E''' and '''B''' are the electric and magnetic field vectors.

As '''E''' and '''B''' fields are coupled, it would be misleading to split this expression into &quot;electric&quot; and &quot;magnetic&quot; contributions. However, in the steady-state case, the fields are no longer coupled (see [[Maxwell's equations]]). It makes sense in that case to compute the electrostatic energy per unit volume:

:&lt;math&gt; u_{ES} = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon |\mathbf{E}|^2 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

The total energy ''U'' stored in the electric field in a given volume ''V'' is therefore
:&lt;math&gt; U_{ES} = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon \int_{V} |\mathbf{E}|^2 \, \mathrm{d}V \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

==Further extensions==

===Definitive equation of vector fields===

{{See also|Defining equation (physics)|List of electromagnetism equations}}

In the presence of matter, it is helpful in electromagnetism to extend the notion of the electric field into three vector fields, rather than just one:&lt;ref&gt;Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, ISBN 978-0-471-92712-9&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}=\varepsilon_0\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{P}\!&lt;/math&gt;

where '''P''' is the [[electric polarization]] – the volume density of [[electric dipole moment]]s, and '''D''' is the [[electric displacement field]]. Since '''E''' and '''P''' are defined separately, this equation can be used to define '''D'''. The physical interpretation of '''D''' is not as clear as '''E''' (effectively the field applied to the material) or '''P''' (induced field due to the dipoles in the material), but still serves as a convenient mathematical simplification, since Maxwell's equations can be simplified in terms of [[Maxwell's equations#Table of 'macroscopic' equations|free charges and currents]].

===Constitutive relation===

{{Main|Constitutive equation}}

The '''E''' and '''D''' fields are related by the [[permittivity]] of the material, ''ε''.&lt;ref&gt;Electricity and Modern Physics (2nd Edition), G.A.G. Bennet, Edward Arnold (UK), 1974, ISBN 0-7131-2459-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, ISBN 978-0-471-92712-9&lt;/ref&gt;
 
For linear, [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]], [[Isotropy|isotropic]] materials '''E''' and '''D''' are proportional and constant throughout the region, there is no position dependence: For inhomogeneous materials, there is a position dependence throughout the material:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D(r)}=\varepsilon\mathbf{E(r)}&lt;/math&gt;

For anisotropic materials the '''E''' and '''D''' fields are not parallel, and so '''E''' and '''D''' are related by the [[Permittivity|permittivity tensor]] (a 2nd order [[tensor field]]), in component form:

:&lt;math&gt;D_i=\varepsilon_{ij}E_j&lt;/math&gt;

For non-linear media, '''E''' and '''D''' are not proportional. Materials can have varying extents of linearity, homogeneity and isotropy.

{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=[[Electrical network|Electrical Network]]}}
An '''electric  potential''' (also called the ''electric field potential'' or the ''electrostatic potential'') is the amount of [[electric potential energy]] that a unitary point [[electric charge]] would have if located at any point in space, and is equal to the [[Work (electrical)|work done]] by an [[electric field]] in carrying a unit of positive charge from infinity to that point. 

According to [[classical electromagnetism|theoretical electromagnetics]], electric potential is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity denoted by {{math|Φ}}(Phi), {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;'''''E'''''&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|''V''}}, equal to the electric potential energy of any charged particle at any location (measured in [[joule]]s) divided by the [[electric charge|charge]] of that particle (measured in [[coulomb]]s). By dividing out the charge on the particle a remainder is obtained that is a property of the electric field itself. 

This value can be calculated in either a static (time-invariant) or a dynamic (varying with time) [[electric field]] at a specific time in units of joules per coulomb ({{math|J C&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}), or [[volt]]s ({{math|V}}). The electric potential at infinity is assumed to be zero. 

A generalized electric [[scalar potential]] is also used in [[electrodynamics]] when time-varying electromagnetic fields are present, but this can not be so simply calculated. The electric potential and the [[magnetic vector potential]] together form a [[four vector]], so that the two kinds of potential are mixed under [[Lorentz transformation]]s.

== Introduction ==
[[Classical mechanics]] explores concepts such as [[Force (physics)|force]], [[energy]], [[potential]] etc. Force and potential energy are directly related. A net force acting on any object will cause it to [[acceleration|accelerate]]. As an object moves in the direction in which the force accelerates it, its potential energy decreases: the gravitational potential energy of a cannonball at the top of a hill is greater than at the base of the hill. As it rolls downhill its potential energy decreases, being translated to motion, inertial (kinetic) energy. 

It is possible to define the potential of certain force fields so that the potential energy of an object in that field depends only on the position of the object with respect to the field. Two such force fields are the [[gravity|gravitational field]] and an electric field (in the absence of time-varying magnetic fields). Such fields must affect objects due to the intrinsic properties of the object (e.g., [[mass]] or charge) and the position of the object.  

Objects may possess a property known as [[electric charge]] and an [[electric field]] exerts a force on charged objects. If the charged object has a positive charge the force will be in the direction of the [[electric field vector]] at that point while if the charge is negative the force will be in the opposite direction. The magnitude of the force is given by the quantity of the charge multiplied by the magnitude of the electric field vector.

== Electrostatics ==
{{main|Electrostatics}}
The electric potential at a point '''r''' in a static [[electric field]] '''E''' is given by the [[line integral]]

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|equation=&lt;math&gt;V_\mathbf{E} = - \int_C \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C478
|background colour = #ECFCC4}}

where ''C'' is an arbitrary path connecting the point with zero potential to '''r'''.  When the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] {{nowrap|'''&amp;nabla;''' &amp;times; '''E'''}} is zero, the line integral above does not depend on the specific path ''C'' chosen but only on its endpoints. In this case, the electric field is [[conservative vector field|conservative]] and determined by the [[gradient]] of the potential:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = - \mathbf{\nabla} V_\mathbf{E}. \, &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C478
|background colour = #ECFCC4}}

Then, by [[Gauss's law]], the potential satisfies [[Poisson's equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \left (- \mathbf{\nabla} V_\mathbf{E} \right ) = -\nabla^2 V_\mathbf{E} = \rho / \varepsilon_0, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the total [[charge density]] (including [[bound charge]]) and '''∇'''· denotes the [[divergence]].

The concept of electric potential  is closely linked with [[potential energy]]. A [[test charge]] ''q'' has an [[electric potential energy]] ''U''&lt;sub&gt;'''E'''&lt;/sub&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;U_ \mathbf{E} = q\,V. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The potential energy and hence also the electric potential is only defined up to an additive constant: one must arbitrarily choose a position where the potential energy and the electric potential are zero.

These equations cannot be used if the curl {{nowrap|'''&amp;nabla;''' &amp;times; '''E''' ≠ 0}}, i.e., in the case of a ''nonconservative electric field'' (caused by a changing [[magnetic field]]; see [[Maxwell's equations]]).  The generalization of electric potential to this case is described below.

=== Electric potential due to a point charge ===
[[File:Electric potential varying charge.gif|right|thumb|150x150px|The electric potential created by a charge ''Q'' is ''V''=''Q''/(4πε&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''r''). Different values of ''Q'' will make different values of electric potential ''V'' (shown in the image).]]

The electric potential created by a point charge ''Q'', at a distance ''r'' from the charge (relative to the potential at infinity), can be shown to be

:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electric constant]] (permittivity of vacuum).  This is known as the Coulomb potential.

The electric potential due to a system of point charges is equal to the sum of the point charges' individual potentials.  This fact simplifies calculations significantly, since addition of potential (scalar) fields is much easier than addition of the electric (vector) fields.

The equation given above for the electric potential (and all the equations used here) are in the forms required by [[SI units]].  In some other (less common) systems of units, such as [[Gaussian units|CGS-Gaussian]], many of these equations would be altered.

== Generalization to electrodynamics ==

When time-varying magnetic fields are present (which is true whenever there are time-varying electric fields and vice versa), it is not possible to describe the electric field simply in terms of a scalar potential ''V'' because the electric field is no longer [[conservative force|conservative]]: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\int_C \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell}&lt;/math&gt; is path-dependent because &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\nabla} \times \mathbf{E} \neq \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt; ([[Faraday's law of induction]]).

Instead, one can still define a scalar potential by also including the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A'''.  In particular, '''A''' is defined to satisfy:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{\nabla} \times \mathbf{A}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. Because [[Gauss's law for magnetism|the divergence of the magnetic field is always zero]] due to the absence of [[magnetic monopole]]s, such an '''A''' can always be found. Given this, the quantity
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{E} + \frac{\partial\mathbf{A}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
''is'' a conservative field by [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] and one can therefore write
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{\nabla}V - \frac{\partial\mathbf{A}}{\partial t}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the scalar potential defined by the conservative field '''F'''.

The electrostatic potential is simply the special case of this definition where '''A''' is time-invariant.  On the other hand, for time-varying fields, 
:&lt;math&gt;-\int_a^b \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell} \neq V_{(b)} - V_{(a)}, \, &lt;/math&gt;
unlike electrostatics.

==Units==
The [[SI]] unit of electric potential is the [[volt]] (in honor of [[Alessandro Volta]]), which is why a difference in electric potential between two points is known as [[voltage]]. Older units are rarely used today.  Variants of the [[centimeter gram second system of units]] included a number of different units for electric potential, including the [[Conversion of units#Electromotive_force.2C_electric_potential_difference|abvolt]] and the [[statvolt]].

==Galvani potential versus electrochemical potential==
{{main|Galvani potential|Electrochemical potential|Fermi level}}
Inside metals (and other solids and liquids), the energy of an electron is affected not only by the electric potential, but also by the specific atomic environment that it is in. When a [[voltmeter]] is connected between two different types of metal, it measures not the electric potential difference, but instead the potential difference corrected for the different atomic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=09QI-assq1cC&amp;pg=PA22 |title=Fundamentals of electrochemistry|first= Vladimir Sergeevich|last= Bagotskii|page=22|isbn=978-0-471-70058-6|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quantity measured by a voltmeter is called [[electrochemical potential]] or [[fermi level]], while the pure unadjusted electric potential is sometimes called [[Galvani potential]]. The terms &quot;voltage&quot; and &quot;electric potential&quot; are a bit ambiguous in that, in practice, they can refer to ''either'' of these in different contexts.

'''Phase''' in [[sinusoidal]] functions or in waves has two different, but closely related, meanings.  One is the initial angle of a sinusoidal function at its [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] and is sometimes called '''phase offset''' or '''phase difference'''.  Another usage is the fraction of the wave cycle that has elapsed relative to the origin.&lt;ref name=Ballou2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Glen |title=Handbook for sound engineers |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y0d9VA0lkogC&amp;pg=PA1499 |edition=3 |year=2005 |publisher=Focal Press, Gulf Professional Publishing |isbn=0-240-80758-8 |page=1499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formula==
The phase of an [[Simple harmonic motion|oscillation]] or [[Sine wave|wave]] refers to a sinusoidal function such as the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x(t) &amp;= A\cdot \cos( 2 \pi f t + \varphi ) \\
y(t) &amp;= A\cdot \sin( 2 \pi f t + \varphi ) = A\cdot \cos\left( 2 \pi f t + \varphi - \tfrac{\pi}{2}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \varphi\,&lt;/math&gt; are constant parameters called the ''amplitude'', ''frequency'', and ''phase'' of the sinusoid.  These functions are periodic with period &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T = \frac{1}{f}\,&lt;/math&gt;, and they are identical except for a displacement of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{T}{4}\,&lt;/math&gt; along the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle t\,&lt;/math&gt; axis.  The term '''phase''' can refer to several different things''':'''
* It can refer to a specified reference, such as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \cos( 2 \pi f t)\,&lt;/math&gt;, in which case we would say the '''phase''' of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \varphi\,&lt;/math&gt;, and the '''phase''' of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \varphi\,-\, \frac{\pi}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* It can refer to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \varphi\,&lt;/math&gt;, in which case we would say &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; have the same '''phase''' but are relative to their own specific references.
* In the context of communication waveforms, the time-variant angle &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 2 \pi f t \,+\, \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, or its [[principal value]], is referred to as '''[[instantaneous phase]]''', often just '''phase'''.

== Phase shift ==
[[Image:Phase shift.svg|thumb|Illustration of phase shift. The horizontal axis represents an angle (phase) that is increasing with time.]]
'''Phase shift''' is any change that occurs in the phase of one quantity, or in the phase difference between two or more quantities.&lt;ref name=Ballou2005/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \varphi\,&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes referred to as a ''phase shift'' or ''phase offset'', because it represents a &quot;shift&quot; from zero phase.

For infinitely long sinusoids, a change in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \varphi\,&lt;/math&gt; is the same as a shift in time, such as a time delay. If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is delayed (time-shifted) by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{1}{4}\,&lt;/math&gt; of its cycle, it becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x\left(t - \tfrac{1}{4} T\right) &amp;= A\cdot \cos\left(2 \pi f \left(t - \tfrac{1}{4}T \right) + \varphi \right) \\
                                  &amp;= A\cdot \cos\left(2 \pi f t - \tfrac{\pi}{2} + \varphi \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

whose &quot;phase&quot; is now &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \varphi \,-\, \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  It has been shifted by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; radians.

== Phase difference {{anchor|Phase difference}} ==
[[Image:Sine waves same phase.svg|thumb|In-phase waves]]
[[Image:Sine waves different phase.svg|thumb|Out-of-phase waves]]
[[Image:Phase-shift illustration.png|right|thumb|Left: the [[real part]] of a [[plane wave]] moving from top to bottom. Right: the same wave after a central section underwent a phase shift, for example, by passing through a glass of different thickness than the other parts.  (The illustration on the right ignores the effect of [[diffraction]], which would make the waveform [[continuous function|continuous]] away from material interfaces and would add increasing distortions with distance.).]]

'''Phase difference''' is the difference, expressed in degrees or time, between two waves having the same frequency and referenced to the same point in time.&lt;ref name=Ballou2005/&gt; Two oscillators that have the same frequency and no phase difference are said to be '''in phase'''. Two oscillators that have the same frequency and different phases have a phase difference, and the oscillators are said to be '''out of phase''' with each other. 

The amount by which such oscillators are out of phase with each other can be expressed in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] from 0° to 360°, or in [[radian]]s from 0 to 2π. If the phase difference is 180 degrees (π radians), then the two oscillators are said to be in '''antiphase'''. If two interacting [[wave]]s meet at a point where they are in antiphase, then destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] will occur. It is common for waves of electromagnetic (light, RF), acoustic (sound) or other energy to become superposed in their transmission medium.  When that happens, the phase difference determines whether they reinforce or weaken each other.  Complete cancellation is possible for waves with equal amplitudes.

Time is sometimes used (instead of angle) to express position within the cycle of an oscillation. A phase difference is analogous to two athletes running around a race track at the same speed and direction but starting at different positions on the track. They pass a point at different instants in time. But the time difference (phase difference) between them is a constant - same for every pass since they are at the same speed and in the same direction. If they were at different speeds (different frequencies), the phase difference is undefined and would only reflect different starting positions. Technically, phase difference between two entities at various frequencies is undefined and does not exist.
* Time zones are also analogous to phase differences.

A real-world example of a sonic phase difference occurs in the [[Native American flute#The Warble|warble of a Native American flute]]. The amplitude of different [[Harmonics|harmonic components]] of same long-held note on the flute come into dominance at different points in the phase cycle.
The phase difference between the different harmonics can be observed on a [[spectrogram]] of the sound of a warbling flute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://Flutopedia.com/warble.htm |title=The Warble |work=Flutopedia |author1=Clint Goss |author2=Barry Higgins |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12712">'''Effective dose''' is a dose quantity in the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] system of [[radiation protection|radiological protection]].&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication, 103 para 103&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the tissue-weighted sum of the [[equivalent dose]]s in all specified tissues and organs of the human body and represents the [[stochastic]] health risk to the whole body, which is the ''probability'' of cancer induction and genetic effects, of low levels of ionising radiation.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, glossary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, para 104 and 105&lt;/ref&gt; It takes into account the type of radiation and the nature of each organ or tissue being irradiated, and enables summation of organ doses due to varying levels and types of radiation, both internal and external, to produce an overall calculated effective dose.

The SI unit for effective dose is the [[sievert]] (Sv) which represents a 5.5% chance of developing cancer.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103&lt;/ref&gt; The effective dose is not intended as a measure of ''deterministic'' health effects, which is the ''severity'' of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, that is measured by the quantity [[absorbed dose]]. &lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 para 104 and 105&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''effective dose''' was developed by Wolfgang Jacobi and published in 1975, and was so convincing that the ICRP incorporated it into their 1977 general recommendations (publication 26) as &quot;effective dose equivalent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Radiological protection Vol 35 No.3 2015 . &quot;Obituary - Wolfgang Jacobi 1928 - 2015.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;effective dose&quot; replaced the name &quot;effective dose equivalent&quot; in 1991. &lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 executive summary para 101&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1977 it has been the central quantity for dose limitation in the ICRP international system of [[radiation protection|radiological protection]].&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication, 103 para 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External dose quantities used in radiation protection and dosimetry]]
According to the ICRP, the main uses of effective dose are the prospective dose assessment for planning and optimisation in radiological protection, and demonstration of compliance with dose limits for regulatory purposes. The effective dose is thus a central dose quantity for regulatory purposes.  &lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 executive summary para j&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRP also says that effective dose has made a significant contribution to radiological protection as it has enabled doses to be summed from whole and partial body exposure from external radiation of various types and from intakes of radionuclides.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 para 101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage for external dose===
The calculation of effective dose is required for partial or non-uniform irradiation of the human body because [[equivalent dose]] does not consider the tissue irradiated, but only the radiation type. Various body tissues react to ionising radiation in different ways, so the ICRP has assigned sensitivity factors to specified tissues and organs so that the effect of partial irradiation can be calculated if the irradiated regions are known.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, para 22 &amp; glossary&lt;/ref&gt;  A radiation field irradiating only a portion of the body will carry lower risk than if the same field irradiated the whole body. To take this into account, the effective doses to the component parts of the body which have been irradiated are calculated and summed. This becomes the effective dose for the whole body, dose quantity ''E''. It is a &quot;protection&quot; dose quantity which can be calculated, but cannot be measured in practice.

An effective dose will carry the same effective risk to the whole body regardless of where it was applied, and it will carry the same effective risk as the same amount of equivalent dose applied uniformly to the whole body.

===Usage for internal dose===
Effective dose can be calculated for [[committed dose]] which is the internal dose resulting from inhaling, ingesting, or injecting radioactive materials. 

The dose quantity used is:

'''Committed effective dose,''' E(''t'') is the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''t'' is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Glossary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation of effective dose==
[[File:SI Radiation dose units.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationship of SI radiation dose units]]
Ionising radiation deposits energy in the matter being irradiated. The quantity used to express this is the [[absorbed dose]], a physical dose quantity that is dependent on the level of incident radiation and the absorption properties of the irradiated object. Absorbed dose is a physical quantity, and is not a satisfactory indicator of biological effect, so to allow consideration of the stochastic radiological risk, the dose quantities equivalent dose and effective dose were devised by the [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) and the ICRP to calculate the biological effect of an absorbed dose.

To obtain an effective dose, the calculated absorbed organ dose ''D''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is first corrected for the radiation type using factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; to give a weighted average of the equivalent dose quantity ''H''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; received in irradiated body tissues, and the result is further corrected for the tissues or organs being irradiated using factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, to produce the effective dose quantity ''E''.

The sum of effective doses divided by the quantity of photosynthesis to all organs and lungs and tissues of the body represents the effective dose for the whole body. If only part of the body is irradiated, then only those regions are used to calculate the effective dose. The tissue weighting factors summate to 1.0, so that if an entire body is radiated with uniformly penetrating external radiation, the effective dose for the entire body is equal to the equivalent dose for the entire body.

===Use of tissue weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;===
The ICRP tissue weighting factors are given in the accompanying table, and the equations used to calculate from either absorbed dose or equivalent dose are also given.

Some tissues like bone marrow are particularly sensitive to radiation, so they are given a weighting factor that is disproportionally large relative to the fraction of body mass they represent. Other tissues like the hard bone surface are particularly insensitive to radiation and are assigned a disproportionally low weighting factor.

Calculating from the equivalent dose:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_T W_T \cdot H_T = \sum_T W_T \sum_R W_R \cdot \bar{D}_{T,R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Calculating from the absorbed dose:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_T W_T \sum_R W_R \cdot \frac{\int_{T}D_R (x,y,z)\rho(x,y,z)dV}{\int_{T}\rho(x,y,z)dV}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;  is the effective dose to the entire organism
:&lt;math&gt;H_T&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent dose absorbed by tissue T
:&lt;math&gt;W_T&lt;/math&gt; is the tissue weighting factor defined by regulation
:&lt;math&gt;W_R&lt;/math&gt; is the radiation weighting factor defined by regulation
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{D}_{T,R}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass-averaged absorbed dose in tissue T by radiation type R
:&lt;math&gt;D_R (x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;  is the absorbed dose from radiation type R as a function of location
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;  is the density as a function of location
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;  is volume
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;  is the tissue or organ of interest

The ICRP tissue weighting factors are chosen to represent the fraction of health risk, or biological effect, which is attributable to the specific tissue named. These weighting factors have been revised twice, as shown in the chart above.

The US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] still endorses the ICRP's 1977 tissue weighting factors in their regulations, in spite of the ICRP's later revised recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1003|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1003.html|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulatory Nomenclature ==
===UK Regulations===
The UK [[Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999]] defines its usage of the term effective dose; &quot;Any reference to an effective dose means the sum of the effective dose to the whole body from external radiation and the committed effective dose from internal radiation.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;The UK Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 &lt;/ref&gt;

===US Effective Dose Equivalent===
The US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] has retained in the US regulation system the older term '''effective dose equivalent''' to refer to a similar quantity to the ICRP effective dose. The NRC's [[total effective dose equivalent]] (TEDE) is the sum of external effective dose with internal committed dose; in other words all sources of dose.

In the US, cumulative equivalent dose due to external whole-body exposure is normally reported to nuclear energy workers in regular dosimetry reports.
*[[deep-dose equivalent]], (DDE) which is properly a whole-body equivalent dose
*'''shallow dose equivalent''', (SDE) which is actually the effective dose to the skin

== History ==
The concept of effective dose was introduced in 1975 by Wolfgang Jacobi (1928 - 2015) in his publication &quot;The concept of an effective dose: a proposal for the combination of organ doses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Radiological protection Vol 35 No.3 2015 . &quot;Obituary - Wolfgang Jacobi 1928 - 2015.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacobi W|title=The concept of effective dose - A proposal for the combination of organ doses|journal=Radiat. Environ. Biophys|year=1975|issue=12|pages=101–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly included in 1977 as “effective dose equivalent” into Publication 26 by the ICRP. In 1991, ICRP publication 60 shortened the name to &quot;effective dose.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 paragraph 101&lt;/ref&gt; This quantity is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the &quot;dose equivalent&quot; because of the earlier name, and that misnomer in turn causes confusion with [[equivalent dose]]. The tissue weighting factors were revised in 1990 and 2007 due to new data.

'''Miles per gallon gasoline equivalent ''' ('''MPGe''' or '''MPG&lt;sub&gt;ge&lt;/sub&gt;''') is a measure of the average distance traveled per unit of energy consumed. MPGe is used by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to compare energy consumption of [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s, [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s and other advanced technology vehicles with the [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] of conventional [[internal combustion]] vehicles expressed as miles per [[United States customary units|US]] [[gallon]].&lt;ref name=DecodingMPG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/fuel-economy/decoding-electric-car-mpg.html|title=Decoding Electric Car MPG: With Kilowatt-Hours, Small Is Beautiful|publisher=[[Edmunds.com]]|author=Paul Seredynski|date=2010-12-21|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPAfueleconomy/&gt;

The MPGe metric was introduced in November 2010 by EPA in the [[Monroney sticker]] of the [[Nissan Leaf]] [[electric car]] and the [[Chevrolet Volt]] [[plug-in hybrid]].

In a joint ruling issued in May 2011 the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) and EPA established the new requirements for a [[fuel economy and environment label]] that is mandatory for all new passenger cars and trucks starting with [[model year]] 2013. This ruling uses miles per gallon gasoline equivalent for all fuel and advanced technology vehicles available in the U.S. market including [[plug-in hybrid]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s, [[Fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell vehicle]], [[natural gas vehicle]]s, [[diesel engine|diesel-powered]] vehicles, and [[Gasoline engine|gasoline-powered]] vehicles.&lt;ref name=EPA2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC2013/&gt; In addition to being displayed on new vehicles, fuel economy ratings are used by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) to publish the annual Fuel Economy Guide; the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] (DOT) to administer the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) program; and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) to collect [[gas guzzler tax]]es.&lt;ref name=EPAfueleconomy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/|title=Fuel Economy Label|publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=2011-02-14|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuel economy estimates for window stickers and CAFE standard compliance are different. The EPA MPGe rating shown in the Monroney label is based on the consumption of the on-board energy content stored in the fuel tank or in the vehicle's battery, or any other energy source, and only represents the [[tank-to-wheel]] energy consumption. CAFE estimates are based on a [[well-to-wheel]] basis and in the case of liquid fuels and [[electric drive vehicle]]s also account for the energy consumed upstream to produce the fuel or electricity and deliver it to the vehicle. Fuel economy for CAFE purposes include an incentive adjustment for alternative fuel vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles which results in higher MPGe than those estimated for window stickers.&lt;ref name=AEI2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sae.org/mags/aei/6559/|title=Many factors figure in fuel-economy calculation for electric vehicles|author=Paul Weissler|work=Automotive Engineering International Online  ([[SAE International]] Magazine)|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DOE2000/&gt;

==Background==

=== 1988: Alternative Motor Fuels Act ===
The Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) enacted in 1988 provides [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) incentives for the manufacture of vehicles that use [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], [[methanol fuel|methanol]], or [[Compressed natural gas|natural gas fuels]], either powered exclusively on these alternative fuels or in conjunction with gasoline or diesel fuel, such [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s. In order to provide incentives for the widespread use of these fuels and to promote the production of alternative fuel vehicles, AMFA allows manufacturers producing [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s to gain CAFE credits by manufacturing these vehicles, which allows them to raise their overall fleet fuel economy levels to comply with the CAFE standards until the established cap level.&lt;ref name=NHTS1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/Laws+&amp;+Regulations/CAFE+-+Fuel+Economy/Report+to+Congress+on+Effects+of+the+Alternative+Motor+Fuels+Act+CAFE+Incentives+Policy|title=Report to Congress on Effects of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act CAFE Incentives Policy|publisher=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]|accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHTS2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/rulings/cafe/alternativefuels/background.htm|title=The Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program (CAFE) - Background: AMFA CAFE Credits|publisher=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]|accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1993, manufacturers of qualified alternative fuel vehicles can benefit for their CAFE estimation,  by computing the weighted average of the fuel economy of the produced alternative fuel vehicles by dividing the alcohol fuel economy by a factor of 0.15. As an example, a dedicated alternative fuel vehicle that would achieve 15 mpg fuel economy while operating on alcohol would have a CAFE calculated as follows:&lt;ref name=NHTS2/&gt;

FE = (1/0.15)(15) = 100 miles per gallon

For alternative dual-fuel vehicles, an assumption is made that the vehicles would operate 50% of the time on the alternative fuel and 50% of the time on conventional fuel, resulting in a fuel economy that is based on a harmonic average of alternative fuel and conventional fuel. For example, for an alternative dual-fuel model that achieves 15 miles per gallon operating on an alcohol fuel and 25 mpg on the conventional fuel, the resulting CAFE would be:&lt;ref name=NHTS2/&gt;

FE = 1 / [(0.5/25) + (0.5/100)] = 40 miles per gallon

Calculation of fuel economy for natural gas vehicles is similar. For the purposes of this calculation, the fuel economy is equal to the weighted average of the fuel economy while operating on natural gas and while operating on either gasoline or diesel fuel. AMFA specifies the energy equivalency of 100 cubic feet of natural gas to be equal to 0.823 gallons of gasoline, with the gallon equivalency of natural gas to be considered to have a fuel content, similar to that for alcohol fuels, equal to 0.15 gallons of fuel.  For example, under this conversion and gallon equivalency, a dedicated natural gas vehicle that achieves 25 miles per 100 cubic feet of natural gas would have a CAFE value as follows:&lt;ref name=NHTS2/&gt;

FE = (25/100) x (100/0.823)(1/0.15) = 203 miles per gallon

The [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]] expanded the definition of alternative fuel to include [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen]], liquid fuels derived from coal and biological materials, [[electric vehicle|electricity]] and any other fuel that the Secretary of Transportation determines to be substantially non-petroleum based and has environmental and energy security benefits. Beginning in 1993, manufacturers of these other alternative fuel automobiles that meet the qualifying requirements can also benefit for special treatment in the calculation of their CAFE.&lt;ref name=NHTS2/&gt;

===1994: Gasoline gallon equivalent===
In 1994 the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) introduced [[gasoline gallon equivalent]] (GGE) as a metric for fuel economy for [[natural gas vehicle]]s. NIST defined a gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) as 5.660 pounds of natural gas, and gasoline liter equivalent (GLE) as 0.678 kilograms of natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/upload/Handbook-44-Appendix-D-Definitions.pdf|title=Handbook 44 Appendix D -Definitions|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|year=2007|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1990s and early 2000s several [[electric car]]s were produced in limited quantities as a result of the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) mandate for more fuel-efficient [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s. Popular models available in [[California]] included the [[General Motors EV1]] and the [[Toyota RAV4 EV]].&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{Cite book | last = [[Daniel Sperling|Sperling, Daniel]] and Deborah Gordon |title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year =2009| pages=22–26|publisher =[[Oxford University Press]], New York| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boschert06&gt;{{Cite book | last = [[Sherry Boschert]] | title = Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America | year = 2006 | pages=15–28| publisher = New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada| isbn = 978-0-86571-571-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US DoE and EPA rating for on board energy efficiency for these electric vehicles was expressed as [[kilowatt-hour]]/mile ([[KWh]]/mi), the most commonly known metric in science and engineering for measuring energy consumption, and used as the billing unit for energy delivered to consumers by [[electric utilities]].&lt;ref name=EVN2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electric-vehicles-cars-bikes.blogspot.com/2009/08/why-are-volt-and-leaf-evs-measured-in.html#|title=Why are the VOLT and LEAF EVs measured in Miles Per Gallon|publisher=Electric Vehicle News|date=2009-08-15|accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to address the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) regulations mandated by the [[US Congress]] in 1975, the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] established in July 2000 a methodology for calculating the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy of [[electric vehicle]]s on a [[well-to-wheel]] basis. The methodology considers the upstream efficiency of the processes involved in the two fuel cycles, including efficiency factors for petroleum refining and distribution, as well as the national average efficiency for electricity generation and transmission.&lt;ref name=DOE2000/&gt;
The formula also includes a fuel efficiency incentive factor of 1/0.15 to benefit electric vehicles. This reward factor is intended provide an incentive for vehicle manufactures to produce and sell electric vehicles, as a higher equivalent fuel economy for EVs improves the carmaker overall fleet fuel economy levels in complying with the CAFE standards,  and Congress anticipated that such an incentive would help accelerate the commercialization of electric vehicles. The incentive factor chosen by DoE for EVs is the same 1/0.15 factor already applied in the regulatory treatment of other types of [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=DOE2000/&gt; When all factors are considered in DoE's formula, the energy efficiency or equivalent fuel economy of electric vehicles increases from 33,705 Wh/gallon (plug-to-wheel) to 82,049 Wh/gallon (well-to-wheel).&lt;ref name=EVN2009/&gt;

===2007: X Prize===
In April 2007, as part of Draft Competition Guidelines released at the New York Auto Show, MPGe was announced as the main merit metric for the [[Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize]], a competition developed by the [[X Prize Foundation]] for super-efficient vehicles that can achieve at least 100 MPGe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: Automotive X Prize Announces Draft Guidelines for Competition to Inspire Super-Efficient Vehicles|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/press-release/automotive-x-prize-announces-draft-guidelines-for-competition-to-inspire-super-ef|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2009, ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' announced that, as part of a partnership with the X Prize Foundation, they planned to report MPGe as one of several measures that will help consumers understand and compare vehicle efficiency for [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: Consumer Reports to Adopt MPGe Measure for Fuel Economy|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-release/consumer-reports-to-partner-with-x-prize-foundation-on-automotive-safety-t|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As required by the 2007 [[Energy Independence and Security Act]] (EISA), with the introduction of [[advanced-technology vehicle]]s in the U.S. new information should be incorporated in the [[Monroney label]] of new cars and light-duty trucks sold in the country, such as ratings on [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], [[greenhouse gas emissions]], and other [[air pollutant]]s. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) have conducted a series of studies to determine the best way to redesign this label to provide consumers with simple energy and environmental comparisons across all vehicles types, including [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEV), [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEV), and conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel, in order to help consumers choose more efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles. These changes were proposed to be introduced in new vehicles beginning with model year 2012.&lt;ref name=EPAfueleconomy/&gt;&lt;ref name=EPAstudy10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/label/420r10909.pdf|title=Environmental Protection Agency Fuel Economy Label - Final Report|author=Office of Transportation and Air Quality, EPA, and [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], Us DoT|publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=September 2010|accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA rating for on board energy efficiency for electric vehicles before 2010 was expressed as [[kilowatt-hour]] per 100 miles (kW-hrs/100&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref name=EVN2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=MiniE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/confusion-over-mpg-ratings-electric-cars-25946/|title=Confusion Over MPG Ratings for Electric Cars|author= Brad Berman|publisher=HybridCars.com|date=2009-07-29|accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[window sticker]] of the 2009 [[Mini E]] showed an energy consumption of 33&amp;nbsp;kW-hrs/100&amp;nbsp;mi for city driving and 36&amp;nbsp;kW-hrs/100&amp;nbsp;mi on the highway, technically equivalent to 102 mpg city and 94 mpg highway.&lt;ref name=MiniE/&gt; The 2009 [[Tesla Roadster]] was rated 32&amp;nbsp;kW-hrs/100&amp;nbsp;mi in city and 33&amp;nbsp;kW-hrs/100&amp;nbsp;mi on the highway, equivalent to 105 mpg city and 102 mpg highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/automobiles/16STICKER.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=Cranking the Volt to 100 M.P.G.|author=Don Sherman|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2008-11-13|accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/11/16/automobiles/16sticker-inline1.html|title=2009 Tesla Roadster window sticke|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2008-11-13|accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the research and redesign process, EPA conducted [[focus group]]s where participants were presented with several options to express the consumption of electricity for [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s. The research showed that participants did not understand the concept of a [[kilowatt hour]] as a measure of electric energy use despite the use of this unit in their monthly electric bills. Instead, participants favored a miles per gallon equivalent, MPGe, as the metric to compare with the familiar miles per gallon used for gasoline vehicles. The research also concluded that the kW-hrs per 100 miles metric was more confusing to focus group participants compared to a miles per kW-hr. Based on these results, EPA decided to use the following fuel economy and fuel consumption metrics on the redesigned labels: MPG (city and highway, and combined); MPGe (city and highway, and combined); Gallons per 100 miles; kW-hrs per 100 miles.&lt;ref name=EPAstudy10/&gt;

The proposed design and final content for two options of the new sticker label that would be introduced in 2013 [[model year]] cars and trucks were consulted for 60 days with the public in 2010, and both include miles per gallon equivalent and kW-hrs per 100 miles as the fuel economy metrics for plug-in cars, but in one option MPGe and annual electricity cost are the two most prominent metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/label/420f10048.pdf|title=EPA and NHTSA Propose Changes to the Motor Vehicle Fuel Economy Label|publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=August 2010|accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/e-p-a-develops-grading-system-for-new-car-stickers/?scp=1&amp;sq=EPA%20new%20window%20sticker%20letter%20grading&amp;st=cse|title=E.P.A.

In May 2011, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) and EPA issued a joint final rule establishing new requirements for a [[fuel economy and environment label]] that is mandatory for all new passenger cars and trucks starting with [[model year]] 2013. The ruling includes new labels for [[alternative fuel]] and [[alternative propulsion]] vehicles available in the US market, such as [[plug-in hybrid]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s, [[Fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell vehicle]], and [[natural gas vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=EPA2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/carlabel/420f11017.pdf|title=Fact Sheet: New Fuel Economy and Environment Labels for a New Generation of Vehicles|author=EPA|publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=May 2011|accessdate=2011-05-25}}''EPA-420-F-11-017''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/felabel-20110525.html|title=EPA, DOT unveil the next generation of fuel economy labels|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2011-05-25|accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common fuel economy metric adopted to allow the comparison of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles is [[miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent]] (MPGe). A gallon of gasoline equivalent means the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity, cubic feet of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG), or kilograms of [[hydrogen]] that is equal to the energy in a gallon of gasoline.&lt;ref name=EPA2013/&gt;

The new labels also show for the first time an estimate of how much fuel or electricity it takes to drive {{Convert|100|mi}}, introducing to U.S. consumers with fuel consumption per distance traveled, the metric commonly used in many other countries. EPA explained that the objective is to avoid the traditional miles per gallon metric that can be potentially misleading when consumers compare fuel economy improvements, and known as the &quot;MPG illusion.&quot;&lt;ref name=EPA2013/&gt;
{{-}}

==Description==
The miles per gallon gasoline equivalent is based on the energy content of gasoline.  The energy obtainable from burning one US gallon of gasoline is 115,000 BTU or 33.70 kWh.&lt;ref name=mpge/&gt;

To convert the mile per gallon rating into other units of distance per unit energy used, the mile per gallon value can be multiplied by one of the following factors to obtain other units:

:{|
|-
|1 MPGe||≈ 1 mile/ per 33.70 [[kilowatt-hour|kW·h]]
|-
| || ≈ 8.696 miles/ million BTU
|-
| ||≈ 0.02967 miles/[[kilowatt-hour|kW·h]]
|-
| ||≈ {{convert|0.02967|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=output only}}/kW·h
|-
| ||≈ 0.013&amp;nbsp;km/MJ
|}

==Conversion to MPGe==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
MPGe is determined by converting the vehicle consumption per unit distance, as determined through computer modeling or completion of an actual driving cycle, from its native units into a gasoline energy equivalent. Examples of native units include W·h for electric vehicles, kg-H2 for hydrogen vehicles, gallons for [[biodiesel]] or [[liquefied natural gas]] vehicles, [[cubic foot|cubic feet]] for [[compressed natural gas]] vehicles, and [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] for [[propane]] or [[Liquefied petroleum gas]] vehicles. Special cases for specific alternative fuels are discussed below, but a general formula for MPGe is:

&lt;math&gt; MPGe = \frac{total~miles~driven}{\left [ \frac{total~energy~of~all~fuels~consumed}{energy~of~one~gallon~of~gasoline} \right ]} = \frac{(total\ miles\ driven) \times (energy\ of\ one\ gallon\ of\ gasoline)}  {total~energy~of~all~fuels~consumed} &lt;/math&gt;

For EPA,  this considers the tank-to-wheel for liquids and wall-to-wheel energy consumption for electricity, i.e. it measures the energy for which the owner usually pays. For EVs the energy cost includes the conversions from AC to charge the battery.&lt;ref name=Argonne&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/HV/457.pdf|title=TEST PROCEDURES AND BENCHMARKING Blended-Type and EV-Capable Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles|author=Michael Duoba ,R. Carlson, J. Wu |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]]|accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA MPGe ratings displayed in window stickers do not account for the energy consumption upstream, which includes the energy or fuel required to generate the electricity or to extract and produce the liquid fuel; the energy losses due to power transmission; or the energy consumed for the transportation of the fuel from the well to the station.&lt;ref name=DOE2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mit.edu/evt/summary_mpgge.pdf|title=Fuel Economy Numbers for Electric Vehicles|author=MIT Electric Vehicle Team|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|date=March 2008|accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic values for the energy content of various fuels are given by the defaults used in the Department of Energy GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy used in Transportation) model,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transportation.anl.gov/modeling_simulation/GREET/ GREET model retrieved 2011 01 20]&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

The energy content of a particular fuel can vary somewhat given its specific chemistry and production method.   For example, in the new efficiency ratings that have been developed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) for [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs) and [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEVs) – see below – the energy content of a gallon of gasoline is assumed to be 114,989.12 BTU  or 33.7 kWh.&lt;ref name=mpge/&gt;

===Electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles===
[[File:Smart ED Monroney sticker WAS 2011 1126.jpg|thumb|[[Monroney label]] showing the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]'s fuel economy equivalent ratings for the 2011 [[Smart ED]] [[electric car]].]]
Between 2008 and 2010 several major automakers began commercializing [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs), which are powered exclusively on electricity, and [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEVs), which use electricity together with a liquid fuel stored in an on-board fuel tank, usually gasoline, but it might be also powered by [[diesel engine|diesel]], [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], or [[flex-fuel]] engines.

For battery electric vehicles, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]s formula to calculate the battery-to wheel MPGe is based on energy standards established by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] in 2000:&lt;ref name=DecodingMPG/&gt;&lt;ref name=AEI2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=DOE2000/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; MPGe = \frac { E_G} {E_M*E_E} = \frac{ 33,705 } {E_M} &lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt; MPGe &lt;/math&gt; is expressed as miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (as shown in the [[Monroney label]])

:&lt;math&gt;  E_G = &lt;/math&gt; energy content per gallon of gasoline = 115,000 [[BTU]]s/gallon, as set by U.S. DoE and reported by the Alternative Fuel Data Center.&lt;ref name=DOE2000/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  E_M = &lt;/math&gt; wall-to-wheel electrical energy consumed per mile ([[Watt-hour|Wh]]/mi) as measured through [[Fuel economy in automobiles#EPA testing procedure: 2008 and beyond|EPA's five standard drive cycle tests]] for electric cars and SAE test procedures&lt;ref name=AEI2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Argonne/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  E_E = &lt;/math&gt; energy per KWatt-hour of electricity (BTU/Wh) = 3.412&lt;ref name=DOE2000/&gt;

The formula employed by the EPA for calculating their rated MPGe does not account for any fuel or energy consumed upstream such as the generation and transmission of electrical power, or [[well-to-wheel]] life cycle, as EPA's comparison with [[internal combustion]] vehicles is made on a [[tank-to-wheel]] versus battery-to wheel basis.

The [[California Air Resources Board]] uses a different [[dynamometer]] testing than EPA, and considers reformulated gasoline sold in that state. For CARB estimates the formula becomes:&lt;ref name=AEI2009/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; MPGe = \frac { E_G} {E_M*E_E} = \frac{ 32,600 } {E_M}&lt;/math&gt;

The new [[SAE International|SAE]] J1711 standard for measuring the exhaust emissions and fuel economy of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s and [[plug-in hybrid]]s was approved in July 2010. The recommended procedures for PHEVs were revised at [[Argonne National Laboratory]], and EPA's new regulation to define PHEV fuel economy reporting protocol is expected to be based on SAE J1711.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=23611|title=SAE Approves Method for Rating Plug-In Hybrid MPG and Emissions|publisher=EV World|date=2010-07-01|accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.sae.org/j1711_201006|title=Recommended Practice for Measuring the Exhaust Emissions and Fuel Economy of Hybrid-Electric Vehicles, Including Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles|publisher=[[SAE International]]|date=2010-06-08|accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010 EPA decided to rate electric mode and gasoline only mode separately, and these are the two figures prominently displayed in the window sticker of the 2011 [[Chevrolet Volt]].

===Conversion using GGE===
{{Main|Gasoline gallon equivalent}}
The same method can be applied to any other alternative fuel vehicle when that vehicle's energy consumption is known. Generally the energy consumption of the vehicle is expressed in units other than W·h/mile, or Btu/mile so additional arithmetic is required to convert to a [[gasoline gallon equivalent]] (GGE), using 33.7 kWh / gallon = 114989.17 btu / gallon. &lt;ref  name=mpge /&gt;

===Hydrogen example with GGE===
The 2008 [[Honda FCX Clarity]] is advertised to have a vehicle consumption of 72&amp;nbsp;mi/kg-{{chem|H|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;honda&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; by converting this energy density to a GGE, it is found that 1.012&amp;nbsp;kg of [[hydrogen]] is needed to meet the equivalent energy of one gallon of gasoline. This conversion factor can now be used to calculate the MPGe for this vehicle.

:&lt;math&gt; MPGe =MPkg_{H_2}  \times {GGE}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; MPGe = 72 \frac{mi}{kg_{H_2}} \times {1.012 \frac{kg_{H_2}}{gallon_{gasoline}}} = 72.8  MPGe&lt;/math&gt;

==Life cycle assessment==

===Pump/Well-to-wheel===
EPA's miles per gallon equivalent metric shown in the window sticker does not measure a vehicle's full cycle [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] or [[well-to-wheel]] life cycle. Rather, the EPA presents MPGe in the same manner as MPG for conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles as displayed in the [[Monroney sticker]], and in both cases the rating only considers the pump-to-wheel or wall-to-wheel energy consumption, i.e. it measures the energy for which the owner usually pays. For EVs the energy cost includes the conversions from AC from the wall used to charge the battery&lt;ref name=&quot;Argonne&quot;/&gt; The EPA ratings displayed in window stickers do not account for the energy consumption upstream, which includes the energy or fuel required to generate the electricity or to extract and produce the liquid fuel; the energy losses due to power transmission; or the energy consumed for the transportation of the fuel from the well to the station.&lt;ref name=DOE2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MIT&quot;/&gt;

===Petroleum-equivalency factor (PEF) — a CAFE metric===

In 2000 the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) established the methodology for calculating the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy of electric vehicles based on the [[well-to-wheel]] (WTW) gasoline-equivalent energy content of electricity (Eg). The methodology considers the upstream efficiency of the processes involved in the two fuel cycles, and considers the national average electricity generation and transmission efficiencies because a [[battery electric vehicle]] burns its fuel (mainly fossil fuels) off-board at the power generation plant.&lt;ref name=DOE2000&gt;{{Cite web|title=Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Program; Petroleum-Equivalent Fuel Economy Calculation; Final Rule|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2000_register&amp;docid=00-14446-filed.pdf|date=2000-06-12|accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This methodology is used by carmakers to estimate credits into their overall [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) for manufacturing [[electric drive vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=AEI2009/&gt;

The equations for determining the petroleum equivalent fuel economy of electric vehicles are the following:&lt;ref name=DOE2000/&gt;

:PEF = Eg * 1/0.15 * AF * DPF
::where:
:::PEF = Petroleum-equivalent fuel economy
:::Eg = Gasoline-equivalent energy content of electricity factor
:::1/0.15 = &quot;Fuel content&quot; factor or incentive factor. DoE selected this value to keep consistency with existing regulatory and statutory procedures, and to provide a similar treatment to manufacturers of all types of [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s
:::AF = Petroleum-fueled accessory factor
:::DPF = Driving pattern factor

The gasoline-equivalent energy content of electricity factor, abbreviated as {{Not a typo|Eg}}, is defined as:
:Eg = gasoline-equivalent energy content of electricity = (Tg * Tt * C) / Tp
::where:
:::Tg = U.S. average fossil-fuel electricity generation efficiency = 0.328
:::Tt = U.S. average electricity transmission efficiency = 0.924
:::Tp = Petroleum refining and distribution efficiency = 0.830
:::C = Watt-hours of energy per gallon of gasoline conversion factor = 33,705 Wh/gal
:::Eg = (0.328 * 0.924 * 33705)/0.830 = 12,307 Wh/gal

:PEF = Eg * 1/0.15 * AF * DPF = 12,307 Wh/gal/0.15 * AF * DPF
:PEF = 82,049 Wh/gal * AF * DPF

The petroleum-fueled accessory factor, AF, is equal to 1 if the electric drive vehicle does not have petroleum-powered accessories installed, and 0.90 if it does.

The driving pattern factor, DPF, is equal to 1, as DoE considered that electric vehicles eligible for inclusion in CAFE will offer capabilities, perhaps excepting driving range, similar to those of conventional vehicles.

In the example provided by the US DoE in its final rule, an [[electric car]] with an energy consumption of 265 [[Watt-hour]] per mile in urban driving, and 220 Watt-hour per mile in highway driving, resulted in a petroleum-equivalent fuel economy of 335.24 miles per gallon, based on a driving schedule factor of 55 percent urban, and 45 percent highway, and using a petroleum equivalency factor of 82,049 Watt-hours per gallon.&lt;ref name=DOE2000/&gt;

A '''physical coefficient''' is an important number that characterizes some physical property of a technical or scientific object.  A coefficient also has a scientific reference which is the reliance on force. To find the coefficient of a [[chemical compound]], you must balance the elements involved in it.  For example, water:
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
It just so happens that hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) are both [[diatomic]] molecules, thus we have H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  To form water, one of the O atoms breaks off from the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule and react with the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compound to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  But, there is one oxygen atom left.  It reacts with another H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.  Since it took two of each atom to balance the compound, we put the coefficient 2 in front of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O:
2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
The total reaction is thus 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

:''This article is about the geometrical property of an area, termed the second moment of area. For the moment of inertia dealing with the rotation of an object with mass, see [[mass moment of inertia]].''

:''For a list, see [[list of area moments of inertia]].''
The '''second moment of area''', also known as '''moment of inertia of plane area''', '''area moment of inertia''', or '''second area moment''', is a geometrical property of an area which reflects how its points are distributed with regard to an arbitrary axis. The second moment of area is typically denoted with either an &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; for an axis that lies in the plane or with a &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; for an axis perpendicular to the plane. Its [[physical unit|unit]] of dimension is length to fourth power, [[Unit of length|L]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

In the field of [[structural engineering]], the second moment of area of the cross-section of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] is an important property used in the calculation of the beam's [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] and the calculation of stress caused by a moment applied to the [[beam (structure)|beam]].


: '''''Note:''' Different disciplines use &quot;Moment of Inertia&quot; (MOI) to refer to either or both of the '''planar''' second moment of area, &lt;math&gt; I = \int_A x^2\, \mathrm dA &lt;/math&gt;, where x is the distance to some reference plane, or the '''polar''' second moment of area, &lt;math&gt; I = \int_A r^2\, \mathrm dA &lt;/math&gt;, where r is the distance to some reference axis.  In each case the integral is over all the infinitesimal elements of ''area'', dA, in some two-dimensional cross-section.  In math and physics, &quot;Moment of Inertia&quot; is strictly the second moment of '''mass''' with respect to distance from an axis: &lt;math&gt; I = \int_m r^2 \mathrm dm &lt;/math&gt;, where r is the distance to some potential rotation axis, and the integral is over all the infinitesimal elements of ''mass'', dm, in a three-dimensional space occupied by an object.  The MOI, in this sense, is the analog of mass for rotational problems.'' In engineering (especially mechanical and civil), &quot;Moment of Inertia&quot; commonly refers to the second moment of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Ferdinand (2009). Vector Mechanics for Engineers: Statics. McGraw-Hill. ISBN 978-0-07-352940-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:Polar Moment of Inertia.svg|frame|right|A schematic showing how the '''polar moment of inertia''' is calculated for an arbitrary shape with respect to the ''z'' axis.  ''ρ'' is the radial distance to the element ''dA'', with projections ''x'' and ''y'' on the axes.]]
The second moment of area for an arbitrary shape with respect to an arbitrary axis &lt;math&gt;BB&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;J_{BB} = \int_A {\rho}^2 \, \mathrm dA&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm dA&lt;/math&gt; = Differential area of the arbitrary shape
: &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; = Distance from the axis BB to dA&lt;ref&gt;Pilkey, Walter D. (2002). Analysis and Design of Elastic Beams. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. ISBN 0-471-38152-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when the desired reference axis is the x-axis the second moment of area, &lt;math&gt;I_{xx}&lt;/math&gt; (often denoted as &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt;) can be computed in [[Cartesian coordinates]] as

: &lt;math&gt;I_{x} = \iint_A y^2\, \mathrm dx\, \mathrm dy&lt;/math&gt;

The second moment of the area is crucial in [[Euler–Bernoulli beam equation|Euler–Bernoulli theory]] of slender beams.

=== Product moment of area ===
More generally, the '''product moment of area''' is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;I_{xy} = \iint_A xy\, \mathrm dx\, \mathrm dy&lt;/math&gt;

== Parallel axis theorem ==
{{Main|Parallel axis theorem}}

It is often easier to derive the second moment of area with respect to its centroidal axis, &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;. However, it may be necessary to calculate the second moment of area with respect to a different, parallel axis, say the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis. The parallel axis theorem states

: &lt;math&gt;I_x = I_{x'} + A d_y^2&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = Area of the shape
: &lt;math&gt;d_y&lt;/math&gt; = Perpendicular distance between the &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axes&lt;ref&gt;Hibbeler, R. C. (2004). Statics and Mechanics of Materials (Second ed.). Pearson Prentice Hall. ISBN 0-13-028127-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar statement can be made about the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis and the parallel centroidal &lt;math&gt;y'&lt;/math&gt; axis. Or, in general, any centroidal &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt; axis and a parallel &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; axis.

== Perpendicular axis theorem ==
{{Main|Perpendicular axis theorem}}

For the simplicity of calculation, it is often desired to define the polar moment of area  (with respect to a perpendicular axis) in terms of two area moments of inertia (both with respect to in-plane axes). The simplest case relates &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_y&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;J_z = \int_A \rho^2\,\mathrm dA = \int_A (x^2 + y^2)\,\mathrm dA = \int_A x^2\,\mathrm dA + \int_A y^2\,\mathrm dA = I_x + I_y&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship relies on the [[Pythagorean theorem]] which relates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and on the [[linearity of integration]].

== Composite shapes ==

For more complex areas, it is often easier to divide the area into a series of &quot;simpler&quot; shapes. The second moment of area for the entire shape is the sum of the second moment of areas of all of its parts about a common axis. This can include shapes that are &quot;missing&quot; (i.e. holes, hollow shapes, etc.), in which case the second moment of area of the &quot;missing&quot; areas are subtracted, rather than added. In other words, the second moment of area of &quot;missing&quot; parts are considered negative for the method of composite shapes.

==Examples==
See [[list of area moments of inertia]] for other shapes.

===Rectangle with centroid at the origin===
Consider a rectangle with base &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; whose [[centroid]] is located at the origin. &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; represents the second moment of area with respect to the x-axis; &lt;math&gt;I_y&lt;/math&gt; represents the second moment of area with respect to the y-axis; &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; represents the polar moment of inertia with respect to the z-axis.

===Annulus centered at origin===
&lt;span style=&quot;padding-left: 24px&quot;&gt;[[Image:Second Moment of Area, Annulus.svg|right|175px]]&lt;/span&gt;
Consider an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] whose center is at the origin, outside radius is &lt;math&gt;r_o&lt;/math&gt;, and inside radius is &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;. Because of the symmetry of the annulus, the centroid also lies at the origin. We can determine the polar moment of inertia, &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt;, about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis by the method of composite shapes. This polar moment of inertia is equivalent to the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_o&lt;/math&gt; minus the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;, both centered at the origin.  First, let us derive the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the origin.  In this case, it is easier to directly calculate &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; as we already have &lt;math&gt;r^2&lt;/math&gt;, which has both an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; component.  Instead of obtaining the second moment of area from [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] as done in the previous section, we shall calculate &lt;math&gt;I_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J_z&lt;/math&gt; directly using [[Polar Coordinates]].

&lt;math&gt;I_{x, circle} = \iint y^2\,dA = \iint (r\sin{\theta)}^2\,dA = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r (r\sin{\theta})^2\left(r\,dr\,d\theta\right) = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^3\sin^2{\theta}\,dr\,d\theta = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r^4\sin^2{\theta}}{4}\,d\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}r^4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;J_{z,circle} = \iint r^2\,dA = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^2\left(r\,dr\,d\theta\right) = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^r r^3\,dr\,d\theta = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r^4}{4}\,d\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}r^4&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the polar moment of inertia about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis for an annulus is simply, as stated above, the difference of the second moments of area of a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_o&lt;/math&gt; and a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;J_{z} = J_{z, r_o} - J_{z, r_i} = \frac{\pi}{2}r_o^4 - \frac{\pi}{2}r_i^4 = \frac{\pi}{2}({r_o} ^4 - {r_i} ^4)&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could change the limits on the &lt;math&gt;dr&lt;/math&gt; integral the first time around to reflect the fact that there is a hole.  This would be done like this.

&lt;math&gt;J_{z} = \iint r^2\,dA = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{r_i}^{r_o} r^2\left(r\,dr\,d\theta\right) = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{r_i}^{r_o} r^3\,dr\,d\theta = \int_0^{2\pi}\left[\frac{r_o^4}{4} - \frac{r_i^4}{4}\right]\,d\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\left(r_o^4 - r_i^4\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Any polygon===
[[File:PoligonoCualquiera.png|thumb|320px|Any Polygon]]
The second moment of area for any [[simple polygon]] on the XY-plane can be computed in general by summing contributions from each segment of the polygon.
A polygon is assumed to be counter clock wise (for clockwise polygon all values will be negative with same absolute value)
:&lt;math&gt;I_x = \frac{1}{12}\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} ( y_i^2 + y_i y_{i+1} + y_{i+1}^2 ) ( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_y = \frac{1}{12}\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} ( x_i^2 + x_i x_{i+1} + x_{i+1}^2 ) (  x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i )&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_{xy} = \frac{1}{24}\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} ( x_i y_{i+1} + 2 x_i y_i + 2 x_{i+1} y_{i+1} + x_{i+1} y_{i}) ( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i )&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x_i , y_i&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt; x_{n+1} = x_1, y_{n+1} = y_1 &lt;/math&gt;) are the coordinates of any polygon vertex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite webpage

In [[electrical engineering]], '''admittance''' is a measure of how easily a circuit or device will allow a current to flow.  It is defined as the [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. The [[SI]] unit of admittance is the [[siemens (unit)|siemens]] (symbol S). [[Oliver Heaviside]] coined the term ''admittance'' in December 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.68.155115|title=Immittance matching for multidimensional open-system photonic crystals|year=2003|last1=Ushida|first1=Jun|last2=Tokushima|first2=Masatoshi|last3=Shirane|first3=Masayuki|last4=Gomyo|first4=Akiko|last5=Yamada|first5=Hirohito|journal=Physical Review B|volume=68|issue=15|arxiv = cond-mat/0306260 |bibcode = 2003PhRvB..68o5115U }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Admittance is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;Y \equiv \frac{1}{Z} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:''Y'' is the admittance, measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]
:''Z'' is the impedance, measured in [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]]

The synonymous unit [[mho]], and the symbol ℧ (an upside-down uppercase omega Ω), are also in common use.

[[electrical resistance|Resistance]] is a measure of the opposition of a circuit to the flow of a steady current, while impedance takes into account not only the resistance but also dynamic effects (known as [[Electrical reactance|reactance]]). Likewise, admittance is not only a measure of the ease with which a steady current can flow, but also the dynamic effects of the material's susceptance to polarization:

:&lt;math&gt;Y = G + j B \,&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*&lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the admittance, measured in siemens.
*&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical conductance|conductance]], measured in siemens.
*&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[susceptance]], measured in siemens.
*&lt;math&gt;j^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;

==Conversion from impedance to admittance==
{{complex Z}}
The impedance, Z, is composed of real and imaginary parts,
:&lt;math&gt;Z = R + jX \,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''R'' is the resistance, measured in ohms
*''X'' is the reactance, measured in ohms

:&lt;math&gt;Y = Z^{-1}= \frac{1}{R + jX} = \left( \frac{1}{R^2 + X^2} \right) \left(R - jX\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Admittance, just like impedance, is a complex number, made up of a [[real number|real]] part (the conductance, ''G''), and an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] part (the susceptance, ''B''), thus:

:&lt;math&gt;Y = G + jB \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' (conductance) and ''B'' (susceptance) are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  G &amp;= \Re(Y) =  \frac{R}{R^2 + X^2} \\
  B &amp;= \Im(Y) = -\frac{X}{R^2 + X^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude and phase of the admittance are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \left | Y \right | &amp;= \sqrt{G^2 + B^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2 + X^2}} \\
            \angle Y &amp;= \arctan \left( \frac{B}{G} \right) = \arctan \left( -\frac{X}{R} \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*''G'' is the conductance, measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]
*''B'' is the susceptance, also measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]

Note that (as shown above) the signs of reactances become reversed in the admittance domain; i.e. capacitive susceptance is positive and inductive susceptance is negative.

[[Image:TurbidityStandards.jpg|right|frame|Turbidity standards of 5, 50, and 500 NTU]]
'''Turbidity''' is the cloudiness or [[haze|haziness]] of a [[fluid]] caused by large numbers of individual [[Particle (ecology)|particles]] that are generally invisible to the [[naked eye]], similar to [[smoke]] in [[air]]. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of [[water quality]].

[[Fluids]] can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the [[Settling|settable solids]]), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are [[colloid]]al. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.

'''Turbidity''' (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic. In plastic production haze is defined as the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5° from the incoming light direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermallaminatingfilms.com/haze.php Haze technical definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Turbidity in open water may be caused by growth of [[phytoplankton]]. Human activities that disturb land, such as [[construction]], [[mining]] and [[agriculture]], can lead to high [[sediment]] levels entering water bodies during rain storms due to [[storm water]] [[surface runoff|runoff]]. Areas prone to high bank erosion rates as well as [[urbanized]] areas also contribute large amounts of turbidity to nearby waters, through stormwater [[water pollution|pollution]] from [[Pavement (material)|paved]] surfaces such as roads, bridges and parking lots.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/urbanmm/index.html &quot;National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Urban Areas.&quot;] Chapters 7 and 8. Document No. EPA 841-B-05-004. November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain industries such as [[quarry]]ing, [[coal mine|mining]] and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from colloidal rock particles.

In drinking water, the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that people may develop [[gastrointestinal diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Mann, C.C. Tam, C.D. Higgins, &amp; L.C. Lodrigues. (2007). The association between drinking water turbidity and gastrointestinal illness: a systematic review. ''BMC Public Health''. 7(256): 1 - 7&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially problematic for immunocompromised people, because contaminants like [[virus]]es or [[bacteria]] can become attached to the suspended solids. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with [[chlorine]] because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly, suspended solids can protect bacteria from [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|ultraviolet (UV) sterilization]] of water.

In water bodies such as [[lake]]s, rivers and [[reservoirs]], high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged [[aquatic plants]] and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as [[fish]] and [[shellfish]]. High turbidity levels can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. This phenomenon has been regularly observed throughout the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the eastern [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Annapolis, MD. [http://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/savpage.htm &quot;Decline of Submerged Plants in Chesapeake Bay.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Chesapeake Bay Program. Annapolis, MD. [http://www.chesapeakebay.net/sediments.aspx &quot;Sediments.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

For many [[mangrove]] areas, high turbidity is needed to support certain species, such as to protect juvenile fish from predators. For most mangroves along the eastern coast of [[Australia]], in particular [[Moreton Bay]], turbidity levels as high as 600 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) are needed for proper [[ecosystem]] health.

==Measurement==
[[Image:Runoff torbidity.jpg|thumb|right|Turbid creek water caused by heavy rains.]]

The most widely used measurement unit for turbidity is the Formazin Turbidity Unit (FTU). [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] refers to its units as FNU (Formazin Nephelometric Units). [[ISO 7027]] provides the method in water quality for the determination of turbidity. It is used to determine the [[concentration]] of suspended particles in a sample of water by measuring the incident light scattered at right angles from the sample. The scattered light is captured by a [[photodiode]], which produces an electronic signal that is converted to a turbidity. [[Open source hardware]] has been developed following the ISO 7027 method to measure turbidity reliably using an [[Arduino]] microcontroller and inexpensive [[LED]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bas Wijnen, G. C. Anzalone and Joshua M. Pearce, Open-source mobile water quality testing platform. Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, 4(3) pp. 532–537 (2014). doi:10.2166/washdev.2014.137 [https://www.academia.edu/8319858/Open-source_mobile_water_quality_testing_platform open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several practical ways of checking water quality, the most direct being some measure of [[attenuation]] (that is, reduction in strength) of light as it passes through a sample column of water. The alternatively used Jackson Candle method (units: Jackson Turbidity Unit or '''JTU''') is essentially the inverse measure of the length of a column of water needed to completely obscure a candle flame viewed through it. The more water needed (the longer the water column), the clearer the water. Of course water alone produces some attenuation, and any substances dissolved in the water that produce color can attenuate some wavelengths. Modern instruments do not use candles, but this approach of attenuation of a light beam through a column of water should be calibrated and reported in JTUs.

The propensity of particles to scatter a light beam focused on them is now considered a more meaningful measure of turbidity in water. Turbidity measured this way uses an instrument called a [[nephelometer]] with the detector set up to the side of the light beam. More light reaches the detector if there are lots of small particles scattering the source beam than if there are few. The units of turbidity from a calibrated nephelometer are called Nephelometric Turbidity Units ('''NTU'''). To some extent, how much light reflects for a given amount of particulates is dependent upon properties of the particles like their shape, color, and reflectivity. For this reason (and the reason that heavier particles settle quickly and do not contribute to a turbidity reading), a correlation between turbidity and [[total suspended solids]] (TSS) is somewhat unique for each location or situation.

Turbidity in lakes, reservoirs, channels, and the ocean can be measured using a [[Secchi disk]]. This black and white disk is lowered into the water until it can no longer be seen; the depth (Secchi depth) is then recorded as a measure of the transparency of the water (inversely related to turbidity). The Secchi disk has the advantages of integrating turbidity over depth (where variable turbidity layers are present), being quick and easy to use, and inexpensive. It can provide a rough indication of the depth of the [[euphotic zone]] with a 3-fold division of the ''Secchi depth'', however this cannot be used in shallow waters where the disk can still be seen on the bottom.

An additional device, which may help measuring turbidity in shallow waters is the turbidity tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2013}}Waterwatch Australia, Module 4 - physical and chemical parameters [http://www.waterwatch.org.au/publications/module4/turbidity.html &quot;Methods Turbidity&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myre, E, Shaw, R.

[http://watsanmissionassistant.wikispaces.com/file/view/Turbidity-Myre_Shaw.pdf/360203097/Turbidity-Myre_Shaw.pdf &quot;The Turbidity Tube&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The turbidity tube condenses water in a graded tube which allows determination of turbidity based on a contrast disk in its bottom, being analogous to the [[Secchi disk]].

Turbidity in air, which causes solar attenuation, is used as a measure of pollution. To model the attenuation of beam irradiance, several turbidity parameters have been introduced, including the Linke turbidity factor (T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;HelioClim (Center for Energy and Processes). Paris, France. [http://www.helioclim.net/linke/index.html &quot;Linke Turbidity Factor.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards and test methods==
[[File:Turbidimeters.JPG|thumb|[[Turbidimeter]]s used at a water purification plant to measure turbidity (in NTU) of raw water and clear water after filtration.]]

===Drinking water standards===
Governments have set standards on the allowable turbidity in drinking water. In the United States, systems that use conventional or direct filtration methods turbidity cannot be higher than 1.0 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) at the plant outlet and all samples for turbidity must be less than or equal to 0.3 NTU for at least 95 percent of the samples in any month. Systems that use filtration other than the conventional or direct filtration must follow state limits, which must include turbidity at no time exceeding 5 NTU. Many drinking water utilities strive to achieve levels as low as 0.1 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/safewater/contaminants/index.html#3 &quot;Drinking Water Contaminants.&quot;] 2009-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The European standards do not appear to address turbidity,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenntech.com/applications/drinking/standards/eu-s-drinking-water-standards.htm&lt;/ref&gt; however, the [[World Health Organization]], establishes that the turbidity of drinking water should not be more than 5 NTU, and should ideally be below 1 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenntech.com/turbidity.htm#ixzz3R3yPreK7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambient water standards===
The U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has published water quality criteria for turbidity.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/criteria/goldbook.pdf &quot;Quality Criteria for Water.&quot;] (Commonly known as the &quot;Gold Book.&quot;) 1986. Document No. EPA-440/5-86-001.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are scientific assessments of the effects of turbidity, which are used by states to develop [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|water quality standards]] for water bodies. (States may also publish their own criteria.) Some states have [[Promulgation|promulgated]] water quality standards for turbidity, including:
* [[Louisiana]]. 25, 50 or 150 NTU, or background plus 10 percent, depending on the water body.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. Baton Rouge, LA.[http://epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/la/la_6_wqs.pdf &quot;Surface Water Quality Standards.&quot;] ''Louisiana Administrative Code (LAC).'' Title 33, Part IX, Chapter 11. August 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vermont]]. 10 NTU or 25 NTU, depending on water body classification.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Water Resources Board. Montpelier, VT. [http://www.nrb.state.vt.us/wrp/publications/wqs.pdf &quot;Vermont Water Quality Standards.&quot;] January 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. 5 NTU over background (when background is 50 NTU or less), or 10 percent increase when background is over 50 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Department of Ecology. Olympia, WA.[http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/wa/wa_10_chapter173-201a.pdf &quot;Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of the State of Washington.&quot;] ''Washington Administrative Code (WAC).''

This is also available on CD-ROM and [http://www.standardmethods.org/ online] by subscription.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Turbidity is commonly treated using either a settling or filtration process. Depending on the application, chemical reagents, will be dosed into the wastewater stream to increase the effectiveness of the settling or filtration process. [[Potable water]] treatment and municipal wastewater plants often remove turbidity with a combination of sand filtration, settling tanks and clarifiers.

[[In-situ water treatment]] or direct dosing for the treatment of turbidity is common when the affected water bodies are dispersed (i.e. there are numerous water bodies spread out over a geographical area, such as small drinking water reservoirs), when the problem is not consistent (i.e. when there is turbidity in a water body only during and after the wet season) or when a low cost solution is required. In-situ treatment of turbidity involves the addition of a reagent, generally a [[flocculant]], evenly dispensed over the surface of the body of water. The flocs then settle at the bottom of the water body where they remain or are removed when the water body is drained. This method is commonly used at [[coal mine]]s and coal loading facilities where stormwater collection ponds have seasonal issues with turbidity. A number of companies offer portable treatment systems for in-situ water treatment or direct dosing of reagents.

===Reagents===
There are a number of [[chemical reagent]]s that are available for treating turbidity. Reagents available for treating turbidity include [[aluminium sulfate]] or [[alum]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.xH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[ferric chloride]] (FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[gypsum]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), poly-[[aluminium chloride]], long chain [[acrylamide]]-based [[polymer]]s and numerous proprietary reagents.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Systems, Clear Solutions newsletter - Focus on Turbidity [http://www.earthsystems.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ClearSolutions_No1_2003.pdf] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The water chemistry must be carefully considered when chemical dosing as some reagents, such as alum, will alter the [[pH]] of the water.

The dosing process must also be considered when using reagents as the flocs may be broken apart by excessive mixing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1494">In physics, the '''thermal conductance quantum''' &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; describes the rate at which [[heat]] is transported through a single [[Ballistic conduction|ballistic]] [[phonon]] channel. It is given by:

&lt;math&gt;g_{0} = \frac{\pi^2 {k_B}^2 T}{3h} \approx (9.456\times10^{-13} W/K^{2})T&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Thermal conductivity|thermal conductance]] of any electrically insulating structure that exhibits ballistic phonon transport is a positive integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt;. The thermal conductance quantum was first measured in 2000.&lt;ref name=Schwab&gt;{{cite journal|title=Measurement of the quantum of thermal conductance|journal=Nature|year=2000|first=K.|last=Schwab|author2=E.

For ballistic electrical conductors, the [[electron]] contribution to the thermal conductance is also quantized as a result of the electrical [[conductance quantum]] and the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3965">The '''conductance quantum''', denoted by the symbol {{math|'''''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''}} is the quantized unit of [[electrical conductance]]. It is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;G_0 = \frac{2 e^2}{h}&lt;/math&gt;= {{val|7.7480917346|(25)|e=-5|u=[[Siemens_(unit)|S]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Barry N. Taylor, Peter J. Mohr |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?conqu2e2sh |title=CODATA Value: Conductance Quantum |year=2010 |work=[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/index.html The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty] |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |accessdate=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears when measuring the conductance of a [[quantum point contact]], and, more generally, is a key component of [[Landauer formula]] which relates the electrical conductance of a quantum conductor to its quantum properties.  It is twice the reciprocal of the [[von Klitzing constant]] (2/''R''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;).

Note that the conductance quantum does not mean that the conductance of any system must be an integer multiple of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Instead, it describes the conductance of two quantum channels (one channel for spin-up and one channel for spin-down) if the probability for transmitting an electron that enters the channel is unity, i.e. if transport through the channel is [[ballistic transport|ballistic]]. If the transmission probability is less than unity, then the conductance of the channel is less than ''G''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The total conductance of a system is equal to the sum of the conductances of all the parallel quantum channels that make up the system.&lt;ref&gt;S. Datta, ''Electronic Transport in Mesoscopic Systems'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-521-59943-1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivation ==
In a 1D wire adiabaticly connecting two reservoirs of potential u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the density of states is: &lt;math&gt;dn/d \epsilon =  2/hv&lt;/math&gt; and the voltage is &lt;math&gt;V = -(u_1 - u_2)/e&lt;/math&gt;. The 1D current going across is the current density: &lt;math&gt;j = -ev(u_1-u_2) dn/d \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;G = I/V  = j/V = 2e^2/h &lt;/math&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Quantized conductance occurs in wires that are ballistic conductors,  when &lt;math&gt;\lambda \gg L &lt;/math&gt;. B. J.van Wees et al first observed the effect in a point contact in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Quantized Conductance of Point Contacts in a Two-Dimensional Electron Gas|last = |first = |date = 1988|journal = PRL|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbon nanotubes have quantized conductance independent of diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Carbon Nanotube Quantum Resistors|last = S.

==Motivation from the uncertainty principle==

A simple, intuitive motivation of the conductance quantum can be made using the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], which states that the minimum energy-time uncertainty is ''ΔEΔt'' ~ ''h'', where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]. The current ''I'' in a quantum channel can be expressed as ''e/τ'', where ''τ'' is transit time and the ''e'' is [[electron charge]]. Applying a voltage ''V'' results in an energy ''E = eV''. If we assume that the energy uncertainty is of order E and the time uncertainty is of order ''τ'', we can write ''ΔEΔt'' ~ ''(eV)(e/I)'' ~ ''h''. Using the fact that the electrical conductance ''G = I/V'', this becomes ''G'' ~ ''e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/h''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20676">{{about|the concept of flux in [[natural science]] and [[mathematics]]}}

[[File:General flux diagram.svg|thumb|400px|Flux '''F''' through a [[surface]], d'''S''' is the [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] [[vector area]] element, '''n''' is the [[unit normal]] to the surface. '''Left:''' No flux passes in the surface, the maximum amount flows normal to the surface. '''Right:''' The reduction in flux passing through a surface can be visualized by reduction in '''F''' or d'''S''' equivalently (resolved into [[Euclidean vector#Decomposition|components]], θ is angle to normal '''n'''). '''F'''·d'''S''' is the component of flux passing though the surface, multiplied by the area of the surface (see [[dot product]]). For this reason flux represents physically a flow ''per unit area''.]]

Flux is a simple and ubiquitous concept throughout [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]] describing the flow of a physical property in space, frequently also with time variation. It is the basis of the field concept in [[field (physics)|physics]] and mathematics. There exist two common usages of the term '''flux''', each with rigorous mathematical frameworks: For transport phenomena, flux is defined as a vector, whereas in electromagnetism, flux is a scalar quantity, as defined by the surface integral. The terms &quot;'''flux'''&quot;, &quot;'''current'''&quot;, &quot;'''flux density'''&quot;, &quot;'''current density'''&quot;, can sometimes be used interchangeably and ambiguously, though the terms used below match those of the contexts in the literature.

== Origin of the term ==
The word ''flux'' comes from [[Latin]]: ''fluxus'' means &quot;flow&quot;, and ''fluere'' is &quot;to flow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English | first=Ernest | last=Weekley | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | year=1967 | isbn=0-486-21873-2 | page=581 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; As ''[[Method of Fluxions|fluxion]]'', this term was introduced into [[differential calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]].

== Flux as flow rate per unit area ==
In '''[[transport phenomena]]''' ([[heat transfer]], [[mass transfer]] and [[fluid dynamics]]), '''flux''' is defined as the ''rate of flow of a property per unit area,'' which has the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] [quantity]·[time]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·[area]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=R. Byron | last=Bird | authorlink=Robert Byron Bird |author2=Stewart, Warren E. |author3=[[Edwin N. Lightfoot|Lightfoot, Edwin N.]]| year=1960 | title=Transport Phenomena | publisher=Wiley | isbn=0-471-07392-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the magnitude of a river's current, i.e. the amount of water that flows through a cross-section of the river each second, or the amount of sunlight that lands on a patch of ground each second is also a kind of flux.

=== General mathematical definition (transport) ===
In this definition, flux is generally a [[vector (geometry)|vector]] due to the widespread and useful definition of [[vector area]], although there are some cases where only the magnitude is important (like in number fluxes, see below). The frequent symbol is ''j'' (or ''J''), and a definition for scalar flux of [[physical quantity]] ''q'' is the [[Limit of a function|limit]]:

:&lt;math&gt;j = \lim \limits_{A \rightarrow 0}\frac{I}{A}=\frac{dI}{dA}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;I = \lim\limits_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta q}{ \Delta t} = \frac{dq}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

is the flow of quantity ''q'' per unit time ''t'', and ''A'' is the area through which the quantity flows.

For vector flux, the [[surface integral]] of '''j''' over a [[surface]] ''S'', followed by an integral over the time duration ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, gives the total amount of the property flowing through the surface in that time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;q=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\iint_S \mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}\,{\rm d}A\,{\rm d}t &lt;/math&gt;

The [[area]] required to calculate the flux is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. The [[vector area]] is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the mass passes through, ''A'', and a [[unit vector]] normal to the area, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. The relation is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A \mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the flux '''j''' passes through the area at an angle θ to the area normal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}= j\cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

where '''·''' is the [[dot product]] of the unit vectors. This is, the component of flux passing through the surface (i.e. normal to it) is ''j'' cos θ, while the component of flux passing tangential to the area is ''j'' sin θ, but there is ''no'' flux actually passing ''through'' the area in the tangential direction. The ''only'' component of flux passing normal to the area is the cosine component.

One could argue, based on the work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]],&lt;ref name = Maxwell/&gt; that the transport definition precedes the more recent way the term is used in electromagnetism. The specific quote from Maxwell is:

{{quote|In the case of fluxes, we have to take the integral, over a surface, of the flux through every element of the surface. The result of this operation is called the [[surface integral]] of the flux. It represents the quantity which passes through the surface. |James Clerk Maxwell}}

=== Transport fluxes ===
Eight of the most common forms of flux from the transport phenomena literature are defined as follows:

# [[Transport phenomena#Momentum transfer|Momentum flux]], the rate of transfer of [[momentum]] across a unit area (N·s·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). ([[viscosity|Newton's law of viscosity]],)&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics P.M&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Essential Principles of Physics|author=P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson|edition=2nd|year=1978|publisher=John Murray|isbn=0 7195 3382 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Heat flux]], the rate of [[heat]] flow across a unit area (J·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). ([[Heat conduction|Fourier's law of conduction]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Carslaw | first=H.S. |author2=Jaeger, J.C. | title=Conduction of Heat in Solids  | edition=Second | year=1959 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-853303-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This definition of heat flux fits Maxwell's original definition.)&lt;ref name = Maxwell/&gt;
# [[Diffusion flux]], the rate of movement of molecules across a unit area (mol·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). ([[Fick's law of diffusion]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics P.M&quot;/&gt;
# [[Volumetric flux]], the rate of [[volume]] flow across a unit area (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). ([[Darcy's law|Darcy's law of groundwater flow]])
# [[Mass flux]], the rate of [[mass]] flow across a unit area (kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). (Either an alternate form of Fick's law that includes the molecular mass, or an alternate form of Darcy's law that includes the density.)
# [[Radiative flux]], the amount of energy transferred in the form of [[photons]] at a certain distance from the source per unit area per second (J·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Used in astronomy to determine the [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] and [[spectral class]] of a star.  Also acts as a generalization of heat flux, which is equal to the radiative flux when restricted to the infrared spectrum.
# [[Energy flux]], the rate of transfer of [[energy]] through a unit area (J·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). The radiative flux and heat flux are specific cases of energy flux.
# [[Particle flux]], the rate of transfer of particles through a unit area ([number of particles] m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)

These fluxes are vectors at each point in space, and have a definite magnitude and direction. Also, one can take the [[divergence]] of any of these fluxes to determine the accumulation rate of the quantity in a control volume around a given point in space.  For [[incompressible flow]], the divergence of the volume flux is zero.

==== Chemical diffusion ====
As mentioned above, chemical [[mass flux#Molar fluxes|molar flux]] of a component A in an [[isothermal]], [[Isobaric process|isobaric system]] is defined in [[Fick's law of diffusion]] as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_A = -D_{AB} \nabla c_A&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[nabla symbol]] ∇ denotes the [[gradient]] operator, ''D&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the diffusion coefficient (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) of component A diffusing through component B, ''c&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[concentration]] ([[mole (unit)|mol]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of component A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Welty | authorlink= |author2=Wicks, Wilson and Rorrer | year=2001 | title=Fundamentals of Momentum, Heat, and Mass Transfer | edition=4th | publisher=Wiley | isbn=0-471-38149-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flux has units of mol·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and fits Maxwell's original definition of flux.&lt;ref name=Maxwell&gt;{{cite book | last=Maxwell | first=James Clerk| authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell | year=1892 | title=Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism | isbn=0-486-60636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For dilute gases, kinetic molecular theory relates the diffusion coefficient ''D'' to the particle density ''n'' = ''N''/''V'', the molecular mass ''m'', the collision [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] ''T'' by
:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{2}{3 n\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{kT}{\pi m}}&lt;/math&gt;
where the second factor is the [[mean free path]] and the square root (with [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]] ''k'') is the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution#Typical speeds|mean velocity]] of the particles.

In turbulent flows, the transport by eddy motion can be expressed as a grossly increased diffusion coefficient.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
{{Main|Probability current}}

In [[quantum mechanics]], particles of mass ''m'' in the [[quantum state]] ψ('''r''', t) have a [[probability amplitude|probability density]] defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \psi^* \psi = |\psi|^2. \,&lt;/math&gt;
So the probability of finding a particle in a differential [[volume element]] d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''r''' is
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm d}P = |\psi|^2 {\rm d}^3\mathbf{r}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Then the number of particles passing perpendicularly through unit area of a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] per unit time is the probability flux;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \frac{i \hbar}{2m} \left(\psi \nabla \psi^* - \psi^* \nabla \psi \right). \,&lt;/math&gt;
This is sometimes referred to as the probability current or current density,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics Demystified|author=D. McMahon|series=Demystified|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|year=2006|isbn=0-07-145546 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or probability flux density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Sakurai, J. J. | title=Advanced Quantum Mechanics | publisher=Addison Wesley | year=1967 | isbn=0-201-06710-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flux as a surface integral ==
[[Image:Flux diagram.png|thumb|The flux visualized. The rings show the surface boundaries. The red arrows stand for the flow of charges, fluid particles, subatomic particles, photons, etc. The number of arrows that pass through each ring is the flux.]]

=== General mathematical definition (surface integral) ===
As a mathematical concept, flux is represented by the [[surface integral#Surface integrals of vector fields|surface integral of a vector field]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vector Analysis|edition=2nd|author=M.R. Spiegel, S. Lipcshutz, D. Spellman|series=Schaum’s Outlines|page=100|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2009|isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\Phi_F=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle A}&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

where '''F''' is a [[vector field]], and d''A'' is the [[vector area]] of the surface ''A'', directed as the [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]].

The surface has to be [[orientability|orientable]], i.e. two sides can be distinguished: the surface does not fold back onto itself. Also, the surface has to be actually oriented, i.e. we use a convention as to flowing which way is counted positive; flowing backward is then counted negative.

The surface normal is directed usually by the [[right-hand rule]].

Conversely, one can consider the flux the more fundamental quantity and call the vector field the '''flux density'''.

Often a vector field is drawn by curves (field lines) following the &quot;flow&quot;; the magnitude of the vector field is then the line density, and the flux through a surface is the number of lines. Lines originate from areas of positive [[divergence]] (sources) and end at areas of negative divergence (sinks).

See also the image at right: the number of red arrows passing through a unit area is the flux density, the [[curve]] encircling the red arrows denotes the boundary of the surface, and the orientation of the arrows with respect to the surface denotes the sign of the [[inner product]] of the vector field with the surface normals.

If the surface encloses a 3D region, usually the surface is oriented such that the '''influx''' is counted positive; the opposite is the '''outflux'''.

The [[divergence theorem]] states that the net outflux through a closed surface, in other words the net outflux from a 3D region, is found by adding the local net outflow from each point in the region (which is expressed by the [[divergence]]).

If the surface is not closed, it has an oriented curve as boundary. [[Stokes' theorem]] states that the flux of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector field is the [[line integral]] of the vector field over this boundary. This path integral is also called [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]], especially in fluid dynamics. Thus the curl is the circulation density.

We can apply the flux and these theorems to many disciplines in which we see currents, forces, etc., applied through areas.

=== Electromagnetism ===
One way to better understand the concept of flux in electromagnetism is by comparing it to a butterfly net. The amount of air moving through the net at any given instant in time is the flux. If the wind speed is high, then the flux through the net is large. If the net is made bigger, then the flux is larger even though the wind speed is the same. For the most air to move through the net, the opening of the net must be facing the direction the wind is blowing. If the net is parallel to the wind, then no wind will be moving through the net. The simplest way to think of flux is &quot;how much air goes through the net&quot;, where the air is a velocity field and the net is the boundary of an imaginary surface.

==== Electric flux ====
Two forms of [[electric flux]] are used, one for the '''E'''-field:&lt;ref name=&quot;Electromagnetism 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Electromagnetism |edition=2nd|author=I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips|series=Manchester Physics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008|isbn=9-780471-927129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrodynamics 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|edition=3rd|author=D.J. Griffiths|publisher=Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley|year=2007|isbn=81-7758-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\Phi_E=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle A}&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

and one for the '''D'''-field (called the [[electric displacement]]):

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\Phi_D=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle A}&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

This quantity arises in [[Gauss's law]] – which states that the flux of the [[electric field]] '''E''' out of a [[closed surface]] is proportional to the [[electric charge]] ''Q&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' enclosed in the surface (independent of how that charge is distributed), the integral form is:

where ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]].

If one considers the flux of the electric field vector, '''E''', for a tube near a point charge in the field the charge but not containing it with sides formed by lines tangent to the field, the flux for the sides is zero and there is an equal and opposite flux at both ends of the tube. This is a consequence of Gauss's Law applied to an inverse square field. The flux for any cross-sectional surface of the tube will be the same. The total flux for any surface surrounding a charge ''q'' is ''q''/ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feynman|first=Richard P|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1964|volume=II|pages=4–8, 9|isbn=0-7382-0008-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In free space the [[electric displacement]] is given by the [[constitutive relation]] '''D''' = ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; '''E''', so for any bounding surface the '''D'''-field flux equals the charge ''Q&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' within it. Here the expression &quot;flux of&quot; indicates a mathematical operation and, as can be seen, the result is not necessarily a &quot;flow&quot;, since nothing actually flows along electric field lines.

==== Magnetic flux ====
The magnetic flux density ([[magnetic field]]) having the unit Wb/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Tesla (unit)|Tesla]]) is denoted by '''B''', and [[magnetic flux]] is defined analogously:&lt;ref name=&quot;Electromagnetism 2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrodynamics 2007&quot;/&gt;

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\Phi_B=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle A}&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

with the same notation above.  The quantity arises in [[Faraday's law of induction]], in integral form:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C \mathbf{E} \cdot d \boldsymbol{\ell} = -\int_{\partial C} {\partial \mathbf{B}\over \partial t} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{s} = - \frac{{\rm d} \Phi_B}{ {\rm d} t}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'''''{{ell}}''' is an infinitesimal vector [[line element]] of the [[closed curve]] ''C'', with [[Magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] equal to the length of the [[infinitesimal]] line element, and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]] given by the tangent to the curve ''C'', with the sign determined by the integration direction.

The time-rate of change of the magnetic flux through a loop of wire is minus the [[electromotive force]] created in that wire. The direction is such that if current is allowed to pass through the wire, the electromotive force will cause a current which &quot;opposes&quot; the change in magnetic field by itself producing a magnetic field opposite to the change.  This is the basis for [[inductor]]s and many [[electric generator]]s.

==== Poynting flux ====
Using this definition, the flux of the [[Poynting vector]] '''S''' over a specified surface is the rate at which electromagnetic energy flows through that surface, defined like before:&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrodynamics 2007&quot;/&gt;

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\Phi_S=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle A}&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} \cdot {\rm d}\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The flux of the [[Poynting vector]] through a surface is the electromagnetic [[power (physics)|power]], or [[energy]] per unit [[time]], passing through that surface. This is commonly used in analysis of [[electromagnetic radiation]], but has application to other electromagnetic systems as well.

Confusingly, the Poynting vector is sometimes called the ''power flux'',  which is an example of the first usage of flux, above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Roald K. | last=Wangsness | year=1986 | title=Electromagnetic Fields | edition=2nd | publisher=Wiley | isbn=0-471-81186-6 }} p.357&lt;/ref&gt; It has units of [[watt]]s per [[square metre]] (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

'''Capacitance''' is the ability of a body to store an electrical [[electric charge|charge]]. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits capacitance. A common form is a parallel-plate [[capacitor]], which consists of two conductive plates insulated from each other, usually sandwiching a [[dielectric]] material. In a parallel plate capacitor, capacitance is directly proportional to the surface area of the conductor plates and inversely proportional to the separation distance between the plates.

If the charges on the plates are +''q'' and −''q'' respectively, and ''V'' gives the [[voltage]] between the plates, then the capacitance ''C'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{q}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;
which gives the voltage/[[electric current|current]] relationship
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = C \frac{\mathrm{d}V(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;
The capacitance is a function only of the geometry of the design (area of the plates and the distance between them) and the [[permittivity]] of the [[dielectric]] material between the plates of the capacitor. For many dielectric materials, the permittivity and thus the capacitance, is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them.

The [[SI]] unit of capacitance is the [[farad]] (symbol: F), named after the English physicist [[Michael Faraday]]. A 1 farad capacitor, when charged with 1 [[coulomb]] of electrical charge, has a potential difference of 1 [[volt]] between its plates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/farad&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, a farad was regarded as an inconveniently large unit, both electrically and physically. Its subdivisions were invariably used, namely the microfarad, nanofarad and picofarad.  More recently, technology has advanced such that capacitors of 1 farad and greater (so-called '[[Electric double-layer capacitor|supercapacitors]]') can be constructed in a structure little larger than a [[coin battery]].  Such capacitors are principally used for energy storage replacing more traditional batteries.

The energy stored in a capacitor is found by [[integral|integrating]] the work ''W'':

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{charging} = \frac{1}{2}CV^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Capacitors==
{{Main|Capacitor}}
The capacitance of the majority of capacitors used in electronic circuits is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the [[farad]]. The most common subunits of capacitance in use today are the [[micro-|micro]]farad (µF), [[nano-|nano]]farad (nF), [[pico-|pico]]farad (pF), and, in microcircuits, [[femto-|femto]]farad (fF). However, specially made [[supercapacitors]] can be much larger (as much as hundreds of farads), and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad.

Capacitance can be calculated if the geometry of the conductors and the dielectric properties of the insulator between the conductors are known. A qualitative explanation for this can be given as follows.&lt;br&gt; Once a positive charge is put unto a conductor, this charge creates an electrical field, repelling any other positive charge to be moved onto the conductor. I.e. increasing the necessary voltage. But if nearby there is another conductor with a negative charge on it, the electrical field of the positive conductor repelling the second positive charge is weakened (the second positive charge also feels the attracting force of the negative charge). So due to the second conductor with a negative charge, it becomes easier to put a positive charge on the already positive charged first conductor, and vice versa. I.e. the necessary voltage is lowered. &lt;br&gt; As a quantitative example consider the capacitance of a capacitor constructed of two parallel plates both of area ''A'' separated by a distance ''d'':
:&lt;math&gt;\ C=\varepsilon_r\varepsilon_0\frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''C'' is the capacitance, in Farads;
:''A'' is the area of overlap of the two plates, in square meters;
:''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[relative static permittivity]] (sometimes called the dielectric constant) of the material between the plates (for a vacuum, {{nowrap|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}});
:''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity|electric constant]] (''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ {{val|8.854|e=-12|u=F.m-1}}); and
:''d'' is the separation between the plates, in meters;

Capacitance is proportional to the area of overlap and inversely proportional to the separation between conducting sheets. The closer the sheets are to each other, the greater the capacitance.
The equation is a good approximation if ''d'' is small compared to the other dimensions of the plates so that the electric field in the capacitor area is uniform, and the so-called ''fringing field'' around the periphery provides only a small contribution to the capacitance. In [[Gaussian units|CGS units]] the equation has the form:&lt;ref&gt;''The Physics Problem Solver'', 1986, [http://books.google.com/books?id=KVM2onr8_QYC&amp;pg=PA648 Google books link]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C=\varepsilon_r\frac{A}{4\pi d}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' in this case has the units of length.
Combining the SI equation for capacitance with the above equation for the energy stored in a capacitance, for a flat-plate capacitor the energy stored is:

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{stored} = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{r}\varepsilon_{0} \frac{A}{d} V^2.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the energy, in joules; ''C'' is the capacitance, in farads; and ''V'' is the voltage, in volts.

===Voltage-dependent capacitors===
The dielectric constant for a number of very useful dielectrics changes as a function of the applied electrical field, for example [[ferroelectric]] materials, so the capacitance for these devices is more complex. For example, in charging such a capacitor the differential increase in voltage with charge is governed by:

:&lt;math&gt;\ dQ=C(V) \, dV&lt;/math&gt;

where the voltage dependence of capacitance, ''C''(''V''), suggests that the capacitance is a function of the electric field strength, which in a large area parallel plate device is given by ''&lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt; = V/d''. This field polarizes the dielectric, which polarization, in the case of a ferroelectric, is a nonlinear ''S''-shaped function of the electric field, which, in the case of a large area parallel plate device, translates into a capacitance that is a nonlinear function of the voltage.&lt;ref name= Araujo&gt;{{Cite book|page=Figure 2, p. 504 |title=Science and Technology of Integrated Ferroelectrics: Selected Papers from Eleven Years of the Proceedings of the International Symposium on Integrated Ferroelectrics |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QMlOkeJ4qN4C&amp;pg=PA504&amp;dq=nonlinear+capacitance+ferroelectric&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 |isbn=90-5699-704-1 |author=Carlos Paz de Araujo, Ramamoorthy Ramesh, George W Taylor (Editors) |publisher=CRC Press |year=2001 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Musikant&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Every Engineer Should Know about Ceramics |author=Solomon Musikant |isbn=0-8247-8498-7 |year=1991 |publisher=CRC Press |page=Figure 3.9, p. 43 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Jc8xRdgdH38C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=nonlinear+capacitance+ferroelectric&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA43,M1 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corresponding to the voltage-dependent capacitance, to charge the capacitor to voltage ''V'' an integral relation is found:

:&lt;math&gt; Q=\int_0^VC(V) \, dV\ &lt;/math&gt;

which agrees with ''Q'' = ''CV'' only when ''C'' is not voltage independent.

By the same token, the energy stored in the capacitor now is given by

:&lt;math&gt;dW =Q \, dV =\left[ \int_0^V\ dV' \ C(V') \right] \ dV \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Integrating:

:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_0^V\ dV\ \int_0^V \ dV' \ C(V') = \int_0^V \ dV' \ \int_{V'}^V \ dV \ C(V') = \int_0^V\ dV' \left(V-V'\right) C(V') \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where interchange of the [[Order of integration (calculus)|order of integration]] is used.

The nonlinear capacitance of a microscope probe scanned along a ferroelectric surface is used to study the domain structure of ferroelectric materials.&lt;ref name=Cho&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scanning Nonlinear Dielectric Microscope |author=Yasuo Cho |edition=in ''Polar Oxides''; [[Rainer Waser|R Waser]], U Böttger &amp; S Tiedke, editors |isbn=3-527-40532-1 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2005 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wQ09DhMBJroC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=nonlinear+capacitance+ferroelectric&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA303,M1 |page=Chapter 16 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of voltage dependent capacitance occurs in [[semiconductor devices]] such as semiconductor [[diode]]s, where the voltage dependence stems not from a change in dielectric constant but in a voltage dependence of the spacing between the charges on the two sides of the capacitor.&lt;ref name=Sze0&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physics of Semiconductor Devices |author=Simon M.

===Frequency-dependent capacitors===
If a capacitor is driven with a time-varying voltage that changes rapidly enough, at some frequency the polarization of the dielectric cannot follow the voltage. As an example of the origin of this mechanism, the internal microscopic dipoles contributing to the dielectric constant cannot move instantly, and so as frequency of an applied alternating voltage increases, the dipole response is limited and the dielectric constant diminishes. A changing dielectric constant with frequency is referred to as [[dielectric dispersion]], and is governed by [[dielectric relaxation]] processes, such as [[Debye relaxation]]. Under transient conditions, the displacement field can be expressed as (see [[electric susceptibility]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{D(t)}=\varepsilon_0\int_{-\infty}^t \ \varepsilon_r (t-t') \boldsymbol E (t')\ dt' , &lt;/math&gt;

indicating the lag in response by the time dependence of ''ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'', calculated in principle from an underlying microscopic analysis, for example, of the dipole behavior in the dielectric. See, for example, [[linear response function]].&lt;ref name=Giuliani&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantum Theory of the Electron Liquid |author=Gabriele Giuliani, Giovanni Vignale |page=111 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kFkIKRfgUpsC&amp;pg=PA538&amp;dq=%22linear+response+theory%22+capacitance+OR+conductance&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA111,M1 |isbn=0-521-82112-6 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rammer&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantum Field Theory of Non-equilibrium States |author=Jørgen Rammer |page=158 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A7TbrAm5Wq0C&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=%22linear+response+theory%22+capacitance+OR+conductance&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA158,M1 |isbn=0-521-87499-8 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The integral extends over the entire past history up to the present time. A [[Fourier analysis#.28Continuous.29 Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] in time then results in:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol D(\omega) = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r(\omega)\boldsymbol E (\omega)\ , &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(''ω'') is now a [[Complex function#Complex functions|complex function]], with an imaginary part related to absorption of energy from the field by the medium. See [[Permittivity#Complex permittivity|permittivity]]. The capacitance, being proportional to the dielectric constant, also exhibits this frequency behavior. Fourier transforming Gauss's law with this form for displacement field:

:&lt;math&gt;I(\omega) = j\omega Q(\omega) = j\omega \oint_{\Sigma} \boldsymbol D (\boldsymbol r , \ \omega)\cdot d \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \ &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;=\left[ G(\omega) + j \omega C(\omega)\right] V(\omega) = \frac {V(\omega)}{Z(\omega)} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where ''j'' is the [[imaginary unit]], ''V''(''ω'') is the voltage component at angular frequency ''ω'', ''G''(''ω'') is the ''real'' part of the current, called the ''conductance'', and ''C''(''ω'') determines the ''imaginary'' part of the current and is the ''capacitance''. ''Z''(''ω'') is the complex impedance.

When a parallel-plate capacitor is filled with a dielectric, the measurement of dielectric properties of the medium is based upon the relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_r(\omega) = \varepsilon '_r(\omega) - j \varepsilon ''_r(\omega) = \frac{1}{j\omega Z(\omega) C_0} = \frac{C_{\text{cmplx}}(\omega)}{C_0} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where a single ''prime'' denotes the real part and a double ''prime'' the imaginary part, ''Z''(''ω'') is the complex impedance with the dielectric present, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;cmplx&lt;/sub&gt;(''ω'') is the so-called ''complex'' capacitance with the dielectric present, and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the capacitance without the dielectric.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{Cite book|title=Springer Handbook of Materials Measurement Methods |author=Horst Czichos, Tetsuya Saito, Leslie Smith |page=475 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8lANaR-Pqi4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA475&amp;dq=%22the+dielectric+permittivity+is+defined%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-20785-6 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coffey&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fractals, diffusion and relaxation in disordered complex systems..Part A |author=William Coffey, Yu.

Using this measurement method, the dielectric constant may exhibit a [[resonance]] at certain frequencies corresponding to characteristic response frequencies (excitation energies) of contributors to the dielectric constant. These resonances are the basis for a number of experimental techniques for detecting defects.

==Capacitance matrix==

The discussion above is limited to the case of two conducting plates, although of arbitrary size and shape. The definition C=Q/V still holds for a single plate given a charge, in which case the field lines produced by that charge terminate as if the plate were at the center of an oppositely charged sphere at infinity.

&lt;math&gt;C = Q/V&lt;/math&gt; does not apply when there are more than two charged plates, or when the net charge on the two plates is non-zero. To handle this case, Maxwell introduced his ''[[coefficients of potential]]''. If three plates are given charges &lt;math&gt;Q_1, Q_2, Q_3&lt;/math&gt;, then the voltage of plate 1 is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V_1 = P_{11}Q_1 + P_{12} Q_2 + P_{13}Q_3, &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the other voltages. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Sir William Thomson]] showed that the coefficients of potential are symmetric, so that &lt;math&gt;P_{12}=P_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, etc. Thus the system can be described by a collection of coefficients known as the ''elastance matrix'' or ''reciprocal capacitance matrix'', which is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{ij} = \frac{\partial V_{i}}{\partial Q_{j}}&lt;/math&gt;

From this, the mutual capacitance &lt;math&gt;C_{m}&lt;/math&gt; between two objects can be defined&lt;ref name=Jackson1999&gt;{{citation|last=Jackson|first=John David|title=Classical Electrodynamic|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1999|location=USA|edition=3rd.|pages=43|isbn=978-0-471-30932-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; by solving for the total charge ''Q'' and using &lt;math&gt;C_{m}=Q/V&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;C_m = \frac{1}{(P_{11} + P_{22})-(P_{12} + P_{21})}&lt;/math&gt;

Since no actual device holds perfectly equal and opposite charges on each of the two &quot;plates&quot;, it is the mutual capacitance that is reported on capacitors.

==Self-capacitance==
In electrical circuits, the term ''capacitance'' is usually a shorthand for the ''[[mutual capacitance]]'' between two adjacent conductors, such as the two plates of a capacitor. However, for an isolated conductor there also exists a property called ''self-capacitance'', which is the amount of electric charge that must be added to an isolated conductor to raise its [[electric potential]] by one unit (i.e. one volt, in most measurement systems).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. Greason|title=Electrostatic discharge in electronics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=404fAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=1992|publisher=Research Studies Press|isbn=978-0-86380-136-5|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference point for this potential is a theoretical hollow conducting sphere, of infinite radius, centered on the conductor. Using this method, the self-capacitance of a conducting sphere of radius ''R'' is given by:&lt;ref name=NSW&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090226225105/http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/COURSES/FIRST_YEAR/pdf%20files/5Capacitanceanddielectr.pdf Lecture notes]; University of New South Wales&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=4\pi\varepsilon_0R \,&lt;/math&gt;

Example values of self-capacitance are:
*for the top &quot;plate&quot; of a [[van de Graaff generator]], typically a sphere 20&amp;nbsp;cm in radius: 22.24 pF
*the planet [[Earth]]: about 710 µF&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tipler | first = Paul | last2 = Mosca | first2 = Gene | title = Physics for scientists and engineers | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2004 | edition = 5th | page =752 | isbn =978-0-7167-0810-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inter-winding capacitance of a [[electromagnetic coil|coil]] is sometimes called self-capacitance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Self-capacitance of inductors|doi=10.1109/63.602562 |author=Massarini, A.; Kazimierczuk, M.K.|year=1997|volume=12 |issue=4|pages= 671–676|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics}}: example of use of term self-capacitance&lt;/ref&gt; but this is a different phenomenon.  It is actually mutual capacitance between the individual turns of the coil and is a form of stray, or [[parasitic capacitance]].  This self-capacitance is an important consideration at high frequencies.  It changes the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the coil and gives rise to parallel [[Electrical resonance|resonance]].  In many applications this is an undesirable effect and sets an upper frequency limit for the correct operation of the circuit.

==Stray capacitance==
{{Main|Parasitic capacitance}}
Any two adjacent conductors can function as a capacitor, though the capacitance is small unless the conductors are close together for long distances or over a large area.  This (often unwanted) capacitance is called parasitic or &quot;stray capacitance&quot;. Stray capacitance can allow signals to leak between otherwise isolated circuits (an effect called [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]), and it can be a limiting factor for proper functioning of circuits at [[high frequency]].

Stray capacitance between the input and output in amplifier circuits can be troublesome because it can form a path for [[Feedback#Electronic engineering|feedback]], which can cause instability and [[parasitic oscillation]] in the amplifier. It is often convenient for analytical purposes to replace this capacitance with a combination of one input-to-ground capacitance and one output-to-ground capacitance; the original configuration — including the input-to-output capacitance — is often referred to as a pi-configuration. Miller's theorem can be used to effect this replacement: it states that, if the gain ratio of two nodes is 1/''K'', then an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] of ''Z'' connecting the two nodes can be replaced with a ''Z''/(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'') impedance between the first node and ground and a ''KZ''/(''K''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) impedance between the second node and ground. Since impedance varies inversely with capacitance, the internode capacitance, ''C'', is replaced by a capacitance of KC from input to ground and a capacitance of (''K''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)''C''/''K'' from output to ground. When the input-to-output gain is very large, the equivalent input-to-ground impedance is very small while the output-to-ground impedance is essentially equal to the original (input-to-output) impedance.

==Capacitance of simple systems==
Calculating the capacitance of a system amounts to solving the [[Laplace equation]] ''∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0'' with a constant potential ''φ'' on the surface of the conductors. This is trivial in cases with high symmetry. There is no solution in terms of elementary functions in more complicated cases.

For quasi-two-dimensional situations analytic functions may be used to map different geometries to each other. See also [[Schwarz–Christoffel mapping]].

==Energy storage==
The [[energy]] (measured in [[joule]]s) stored in a capacitor is equal to the ''work'' required to push the charges into the capacitor, i.e. to charge it. Consider a capacitor of capacitance ''C'', holding a charge +''q'' on one plate and −''q'' on the other. Moving a small element of charge d''q'' from one plate to the other against the potential difference {{nowrap|''V'' {{=}} ''q/C''}} requires the work d''W'':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}W = \frac{q}{C}\,\mathrm{d}q &lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the work measured in joules, ''q'' is the charge measured in coulombs and ''C'' is the capacitance, measured in farads.

The energy stored in a capacitor is found by [[integral|integrating]] this equation. Starting with an uncharged capacitance ({{nowrap|''q'' {{=}} 0}}) and moving charge from one plate to the other until the plates have charge +''Q'' and −''Q'' requires the work ''W'':

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{charging} = \int_0^Q \frac{q}{C} \, \mathrm{d}q = \frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C} = \frac{1}{2}QV = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 = W_\text{stored}.&lt;/math&gt;
==Capacitance of nanoscale systems==
The capacitance of nanoscale dielectric capacitors such as [[quantum dots]] may differ from conventional formulations of larger capacitors. In particular, the electrostatic potential difference experienced by electrons in conventional capacitors is spatially well-defined and fixed by the shape and size of metallic electrodes in addition to the statistically large number of electrons present in conventional capacitors. In nanoscale capacitors, however, the electrostatic potentials experienced by electrons are determined by the number and locations of all electrons that contribute to the electronic properties of the device. In such devices, the number of electrons may be very small, however, the resulting spatial distribution of equipotential surfaces within the device are exceedingly complex.

===Single-electron devices===
The capacitance of a connected, or &quot;closed&quot;, single-electron device is twice the capacitance of an unconnected, or &quot;open&quot;, single-electron device.&lt;ref name= Tsu&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact may be traced more fundamentally to the energy stored in the single-electron device whose &quot;direct polarization&quot; interaction energy may be equally divided into the interaction of the electron with the polarized charge on the device itself due to the presence of the electron and the amount of potential energy required to form the polarized charge on the device (the interaction of charges in the device's dielectric material with the potential due to the electron).&lt;ref name= LaFave-DCD&gt;

===Few-electron devices===
The derivation of a &quot;quantum capacitance&quot; of a few-electron device involves the thermodynamic chemical potential of an ''N''-particle system given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(N) = U(N) - U(N-1)&lt;/math&gt;

whose energy terms may be obtained as solutions of the Schr&amp;ouml;dinger equation. The definition of capacitance,

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over C} \equiv {\Delta \,V\over\Delta \,Q}&lt;/math&gt;,

with the potential difference

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \,V  = {\Delta \,\mu \,\over e} = {\mu(N+\Delta \,N) -\mu(N) \over e}&lt;/math&gt;

may be applied to the device with the addition or removal of individual electrons,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \,N = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \,Q=e&lt;/math&gt;.

Then

:&lt;math&gt;C_Q(N) = {e^2\over\mu(N+1)-\mu(N)} = {e^2 \over E(N)}&lt;/math&gt;

is the &quot;quantum capacitance&quot; of the device.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |year=1995
 |title=Capacitive nature of atomic-sized structures

 |issue=15
 |doi=10.1103/physrevb.52.10737
|bibcode = 1995PhRvB..5210737I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This expression of &quot;quantum capacitance&quot; may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;C_Q(N) = {e^2\over U(N)}&lt;/math&gt;

which differs from the conventional expression described in the introduction where &lt;math&gt;W_\text{stored} = U&lt;/math&gt;, the stored electrostatic potential energy,

:&lt;math&gt;C = {Q^2\over 2U}&lt;/math&gt;

by a factor of 1/2 with &lt;math&gt;Q = Ne&lt;/math&gt;.

However, within the framework of purely classical electrostatic interactions, the appearance of the factor of 1/2 is the result of integration in the conventional formulation,

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{charging} = U = \int_0^Q \frac{q}{C} \, \mathrm{d}q&lt;/math&gt;

which is appropriate since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}q = 0&lt;/math&gt; for systems involving either many electrons or metallic electrodes, but in few-electron systems, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}q \to \Delta \,Q= e&lt;/math&gt;. The integral generally becomes a summation. One may trivially combine the expressions of capacitance and electrostatic interaction energy,

:&lt;math&gt;Q=CV&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U=QV&lt;/math&gt;,

respectively, to obtain,

:&lt;math&gt;C = Q{1\over V} = Q {Q \over U} = {Q^2 \over U}&lt;/math&gt;

which is similar to the quantum capacitance. A more rigorous derivation is reported in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, to circumvent the mathematical challenges of the spatially complex equipotential surfaces within the device, an ''average'' electrostatic potential experiences by ''each'' electron is utilized in the derivation.

The reason for apparent mathematical differences is understood more fundamentally as the potential energy, &lt;math&gt;U(N)&lt;/math&gt;, of an isolated device (self-capacitance) is twice that stored in a &quot;connected&quot; device in the lower limit ''N''=1. As ''N'' grows large, &lt;math&gt;U(N)\to U&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LaFave-DCD/&gt; Thus, the general expression of capacitance is

:&lt;math&gt;C(N) = {(Ne)^2 \over U(N)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In nanoscale devices such as quantum dots, the &quot;capacitor&quot; is often an isolated, or partially isolated, component within the device. The primary differences between nanoscale capacitors and macroscopic (conventional) capacitors are the number of excess electrons (charge carriers, or electrons, that contribute to the device's electronic behavior) and the shape and size of metallic electrodes. In nanoscale devices, [[nanowires]] consisting of metal atoms typically do not exhibit the same conductive properties as their macroscopic, or bulk material, counterparts.

'''Enthalpy''' is defined as a thermodynamic state function, designated by the letter &quot;H&quot;, that consists of the [[internal energy]] of the system (U) plus the product of [[pressure]] (p) and [[volume]] (V) of the system:&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. Zemansky (1968), ''Heat and Thermodynamics'', Chapter 11 (5th edition) page 275, McGraw Hill, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;H = U + pV&lt;/math&gt;

Since U, p and V are all functions of the state of the [[thermodynamic system]], enthalpy is a [[state function]].

The unit of measurement for enthalpy in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the [[joule]], but other historical, conventional units are still in use, such as the [[British thermal unit]] and the [[calorie]].

The enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical, biological, and physical measurements at constant pressure, because it simplifies the description of [[energy transfer]]. At constant pressure, the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work.

The total enthalpy, ''H'', of a system cannot be measured directly. The same situation exists in classical mechanics: only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning. Enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential, so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system, we must refer to a defined reference point; therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy, Δ''H''. The Δ''H'' is a positive change in [[endothermic]] reactions, and negative in heat-releasing [[exothermic]] processes. 

For processes under constant pressure, Δ''H'' is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system, plus the [[Work (thermodynamics)#Pressure-volume work|pressure-volume work]] that the system has done on its surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;G.J. Van Wylen and R.E. Sonntag (1985), ''Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics'', Section 5.5 (3rd edition), John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. New York.  ISBN 0-471-82933-1&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed (or released) by the material through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer. Enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure assume [[standard state]]: most commonly 1 bar pressure. Standard state does not, strictly speaking, specify a temperature (see [[standard state]]), but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.

Enthalpy of ideal gases and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure, unlike [[entropy]] and [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]]. Real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior, which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses.

==Origins==

The word ''enthalpy'' is based on the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''enthalpein'' (ἐνθάλπειν), which means &quot;to warm in&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*e%3Aentry+group%3D115 &quot;ἐνθάλπω&quot;]. ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It comes from the [[Classical Greek language|Classical Greek]] prefix [[wikt:ἐν|ἐν-]] ''en-'', meaning &quot;to put into&quot;, and the verb [[wikt:θάλπω|θάλπειν]] ''thalpein'', meaning &quot;to heat&quot;. The word ''enthalpy'' is often incorrectly attributed{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} to [[Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron]] and [[Rudolf Clausius]] through the 1850 publication of their [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]].  This misconception was popularized by the 1927 publication of ''[[enthalpy–entropy chart|The Mollier Steam Tables and Diagrams]]''. However, neither the concept, the word, nor the symbol for enthalpy existed until well after Clapeyron's death.

The earliest writings to contain the concept of enthalpy did not appear until 1875,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|last1=Henderson|first1=Douglas|last2=Eyring|first2=Henry|last3=Jost|first3=Wilhelm
|title=Physical Chemistry: An Advanced Treatise
|publisher=Academic Press|year=1967|page=29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
when [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] introduced &quot;a heat function for constant pressure&quot;. However, Gibbs did not use the word &quot;enthalpy&quot; in his writings.&lt;ref group=note&gt;''The Collected Works of J. Willard Gibbs, Vol. I'' do not contain reference to the word enthalpy, but rather reference the heat function for constant pressure.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual word first appears in the scientific literature in a 1909 publication by J. P. Dalton.  According to that publication, [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] (1853-1926) actually coined the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Laidler|first1=Keith|authorlink=Keith J. Laidler|title=The World of Physical Chemistry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, many different symbols were used to denote enthalpy. It was not until 1922 that Alfred W. Porter proposed the symbol &quot;H&quot; as the accepted standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed079p697 |last=Howard|first=Irmgard |year=2002|title=H Is for Enthalpy, Thanks to Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and Alfred W. Porter|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|publisher=ACS Publications|volume=79|issue=6|pages=697|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed079p697|bibcode = 2002JChEd..79..697H }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus finalizing the terminology still in use today.

==Formal definition==
The enthalpy of a homogeneous system is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Guggenheim, Thermodynamics, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zumdahl, Steven S.|chapter=Thermochemistry|title=Chemistry|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=978-0-547-12532-9|page=243|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LLWkH82PNbYC&amp;pg=PA243}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H = U + p V\,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''H'' is the enthalpy of the system
:''U'' is the [[internal energy]] of the system
:''p'' is the [[pressure]] of the system
:''V'' is the [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] of the system.

The enthalpy is an [[extensive property]]. This means that, for homogeneous systems, the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system. It is convenient to introduce the specific enthalpy ''h'' =''H/m'' where ''m'' is the mass of the system, or the molar enthalpy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = ''H/n'', where ''n'' is the number of moles (''h'' and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; are [[intensive properties]]). For inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems

:&lt;math&gt;H = \Sigma_k H_k&lt;/math&gt;

where the label ''k'' refers to the various subsystems. In case of continuously varying ''p'', ''T'', and/or composition the summation becomes an integral:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \int \rho h \mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the density.

The enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function ''H''(''S,p'')  of the entropy ''S'' and the pressure ''p'', and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows. We start from the [[first law of thermodynamics]] for closed systems for an infinitesimal process

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} U = \delta Q -\delta W.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, δ''Q''  is a small amount of heat added to the system and δ''W'' a small amount of work performed by the system. In a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place so the [[second law of thermodynamics]] gives δ''Q'' = ''T''d''S'' with ''T'' the [[absolute temperature]] of the system. Furthermore, if only pV work is done, δ''W'' = ''p''d''V''. As a result

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} U = T\mathrm{d}S-p\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

Adding d(''pV'') to both sides of this expression gives

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U+ \mathrm{d}(pV) = T\mathrm{d}S-p\mathrm{d}V+ \mathrm{d}(pV)&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} (U + pV) = T\mathrm{d}S+V\mathrm{d}p.&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} H(S,p) = T\mathrm{d} S + V \mathrm{d} p.&lt;/math&gt;

==Other expressions==
The above expression of d''H'' in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers. However, there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure&lt;ref&gt;Guggenheim, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Moran and H.N. Shapiro &quot;Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics&quot; 5th edition, (2006) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., p.511.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}H = C_p\mathrm{d}T+V(1-\alpha T)\mathrm{d}p.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''C''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the heat capacity at constant pressure and ''α'' is the coefficient of (cubic) thermal expansion

&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\part V}{\part T}\right)_p.&lt;/math&gt;

With this expression one can, in principle, determine the enthalpy if ''C''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V'' are known as functions of ''p'' and ''T''.

Notice that for an [[ideal gas]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha T = 1&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref group=note&gt;&lt;math&gt;\alpha T=\frac{T}{V}\left(\frac{\part (n R T / P)}{\part T}\right)_p = \frac{nRT}{PV} = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; so that:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}H = C_p\mathrm{d}T&lt;/math&gt;

In a more general form, the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the [[chemical potential]] and the number of particles of various types. The differential statement for d''H'' then becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}H = T\mathrm{d}S+V\mathrm{d}p + \sum_i \mu_i \mathrm{d}N_i&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the chemical potential per particle for an ''i''-type particle, and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of such particles. The last term can also be written as ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;d''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (with d''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the number of moles of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; the molar chemical potential) or as ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;d''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (with d''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the mass of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; the specific chemical potential).

==Physical interpretation==
The ''U'' term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system, and the ''pV'' term as the energy that would be required to &quot;make room&quot; for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant. When a system, for example, ''n'' [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of a gas of [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] ''V'' at [[pressure]] ''p'' and [[temperature]] ''T'', is created or brought to its present state from [[absolute zero]], energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy ''U'' plus ''pV'', where ''pV'' is the [[Work (physics)|work]] done in pushing against the ambient (atmospheric) pressure.

In basic [[physics]] and [[statistical mechanics]] it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used.&lt;ref&gt;F. Reif Statistical physics McGraw-Hill, London (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Kittel and H. Kroemer Thermal physics Freeman London (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; In basic [[chemistry]], experiments are often conducted at constant [[atmospheric pressure]], and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled, so that  ''ΔH'' is the expression chosen for the [[heat of reaction]].

== Relationship to heat ==
In order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply we return to the first law for closed systems: d''U'' = δ''Q'' - δ''W''. We apply it to the special case that the pressure at the surface is uniform. In this case the work term can be split into two contributions, the so-called pV work, given by ''p''d''V'' (where here ''p'' is the pressure at the surface, d''V'' is the increase of the volume of the system) and all other types of work δ''W'' ', such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction. So we write δ''W'' = ''p''d''V''+δ''W'' '. In this case the first law reads

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} U = \delta Q -p\mathrm{d}V-\delta W^\prime&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} H = \delta Q +V\mathrm{d}p-\delta W^\prime.&lt;/math&gt;

From this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added [[heat]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} H = \delta Q &lt;/math&gt;

provided that the system is under [[isobaric system|constant pressure]] (d''p'' = 0) and that the only work done by the system is expansion work (δ''W''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Ebbing, Darrel &amp; Gammon, Steven|title=General Chemistry|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=978-0-538-49752-7|page=231|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8_7iGj4QLR4C&amp;pg=PA231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In thermodynamics, one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from &quot;nothingness&quot;; the mechanical work required, ''pV'', differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the [[thermodynamic system]].

[[Energy]] must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system, assuming that the pressure ''p'' remains constant; this is the ''pV'' term. The supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy, ''U'', which includes [[activation energy|activation energies]], ionization energies, mixing energies, vaporization energies, chemical bond energies, and so forth. Together, these constitute the change in the enthalpy ''U'' + ''pV''. For systems at constant pressure, with no external work done other than the ''pV'' work, the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system.

For a simple system, with a constant number of particles, the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant.{{Citequote|date=September 2014}}

===Heat of reaction===
{{Main|Standard enthalpy of reaction}}
The total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly;  the ''enthalpy change'' of a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] is measured instead. Enthalpy change is defined by the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;H_f&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;H_i&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;enthalpy change&quot;

&lt;math&gt;H_f&lt;/math&gt;  is the final enthalpy of the system, expressed in joules. In a chemical reaction,&lt;math&gt;H_f&lt;/math&gt; is the enthalpy of the products.

&lt;math&gt;H_i&lt;/math&gt; is the initial enthalpy of the system, expressed in joules. In a chemical reaction,&lt;math&gt;H_i&lt;/math&gt; is the enthalpy of the reactants.

For an [[exothermic reaction]] at constant [[pressure]], the system's change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction, including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings.  In a similar manner, for an [[endothermic]] reaction, the system's change in enthalpy is equal to the energy ''absorbed'' in the reaction, including the energy ''lost by'' the system and ''gained'' from compression from its surroundings.  A relatively easy way to determine whether or not a reaction is exothermic or endothermic is to determine the sign of Δ''H''.  If Δ''H'' is positive, the reaction is endothermic, that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants.  On the other hand if Δ''H'' is negative, the reaction is exothermic, that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat.

===Specific enthalpy===
The specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as ''h'' = ''H''/''m'' where ''m'' is the mass of the system. The [[SI unit]] for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram. It can be expressed in other specific quantities by ''h'' = ''u'' + ''pv'', where ''u'' is the specific [[internal energy]], ''p'' is the pressure, and ''v'' is specific volume, which is equal to 1/''ρ'', where ''ρ'' is the density.

===Enthalpy changes===
An enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction. It is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed, i.e. the enthalpy of the [[Product (chemistry)|products]], and the initial enthalpy of the system, i.e. the reactants. These processes are reversible{{why|date=March 2015}} and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change.

A common standard enthalpy change is the [[enthalpy of formation]], which has been determined for a large number of substances. Enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works, such as the [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]. The following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics.

When used in these recognized terms the qualifier ''change'' is usually dropped and the property is simply termed ''enthalpy of 'process'''. Since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters, or [[standard conditions]], including: 
* A [[temperature]] of 25&amp;nbsp;°C or 298 K,
* A [[pressure]] of one atmosphere (1 atm or 101.325 kPa),
* A [[concentration]] of 1.0 M when the element or compound is present in solution,
* Elements or compounds in their normal physical states, i.e. [[standard state]].
For such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term ''standard'', e.g. ''standard enthalpy of formation''.

Chemical properties:
* [[Enthalpy of reaction]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of substance reacts completely.
* [[Enthalpy of formation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a compound is formed from its elementary antecedents.
* [[Enthalpy of combustion]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a substance burns completely with oxygen.
* [[Enthalpy of hydrogenation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of an unsaturated compound reacts completely with an excess of hydrogen to form a saturated compound.
* [[Enthalpy of atomization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to atomize one mole of compound completely.
*[[Enthalpy of neutralization]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of water is formed when an acid and a base react.
* Standard [[Enthalpy of solution]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a solute is dissolved completely in an excess of solvent, so that the solution is at infinite dilution.
* Standard enthalpy of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)]], defined as the enthalpy change required to denature one mole of compound.
* [[Hydration energy|Enthalpy of hydration]], defined as the enthalpy change observed when one mole of gaseous ions are completely dissolved in water forming one mole of aqueous ions.

Physical properties:
* [[Enthalpy of fusion]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and liquid states.
* [[Enthalpy of vaporization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between liquid and gaseous states.
* [[Enthalpy of sublimation]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and gaseous states.
* [[Lattice enthalpy]], defined as the energy required to separate one mole of an ionic compound into separated gaseous ions to an infinite distance apart (meaning no force of attraction).
* [[Enthalpy of mixing]], defined as the enthalpy change upon mixing of two (non-reacting) chemical substances.

===Open systems===
In [[thermodynamic]] [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]], matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries. The first law of thermodynamics for open systems states: The increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating, minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system. The first law for open systems is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}U = \mathrm{\delta}Q + \mathrm{d}U_{in} - \mathrm{d} U_{out} - \mathrm{\delta} W&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_{in}&lt;/math&gt; is the average internal energy entering the system and &lt;math&gt;U_{out}&lt;/math&gt; is the average internal energy leaving the system.

[[Image:First law open system.svg|250px|thumb|right|Fig.1 During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady, continuous]] operation, an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy added]]

The region of space enclosed by open system boundaries is usually called a [[control volume]], and it may or may not correspond to physical walls.  If we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface, then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system, and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid.  There are then two types of work performed: ''flow work'' described above, which is performed on the fluid (this is also often called ''pV work''), and ''shaft work'', which may be performed on some mechanical device.

These two types of work are expressed in the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\delta}W = \mathrm{d}(p_{out}V_{out}) - \mathrm{d}(p_{in}V_{in}) + \mathrm{\delta}W_{shaft}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution into the equation above for the control volume cv yields:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U_{cv} = \mathrm{\delta}Q + \mathrm{d}U_{in} + \mathrm{d}(p_{in}V_{in}) - \mathrm{d}U_{out} - \mathrm{d}(p_{out}V_{out}) - \mathrm{\delta}W_{shaft}&lt;/math&gt;.

The definition of enthalpy, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, permits us to use this [[thermodynamic potential]] to account for both internal energy and &lt;math&gt;pV&lt;/math&gt; work in fluids for open systems:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U_{cv} = \mathrm{\delta}Q + \mathrm{d}H_{in} - \mathrm{d}H_{out} - \mathrm{\delta}W_{shaft}&lt;/math&gt;.

This expression is described by Fig.1. If we allow also the system boundary to move (e.g. due to moving pistons) we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Moran and H.N. Shapiro &quot;Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics&quot; 5th edition, (2006) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., p.129.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of time derivatives it reads

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}t} = \Sigma_k \dot Q_k + \Sigma_k \dot H_k - \Sigma_k p_k\frac{\mathrm{d}V_k}{\mathrm{d}t}-P,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; represent algebraic sums and the indices ''k'' refer to the various places where heat is supplied, matter flows into the system, and boundaries are moving. The &lt;math&gt;\dot H_k&lt;/math&gt; terms represent enthalpy flows, which can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\dot H_k = h_k\dot m_k = H_m\dot n_k&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\dot m_k&lt;/math&gt; the mass flow and &lt;math&gt;\dot n_k&lt;/math&gt; the molar flow at position ''k'' respectively. The term d''V''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t'' represents the rate of change of the system volume at position ''k'' that results in pV power done by the system. The parameter ''P'' represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power, but it can also be e.g. electric power produced by an electrical power plant. Note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet.{{what|reason=This new type of energy, kinetic energy, was not mentioned before. Is it part of U? Does it need to be conserved, or just the net flow across boundary be zero?|date=March 2015}} Otherwise, it has to be included in the enthalpy balance. During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady-state]] operation of a device (''see [[turbine]], [[pump]], and [[engine]]''), the average d''U''/d''t'' may be set equal to zero. This yields a useful expression for the average [[Power (physics)|power]] generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions

:&lt;math&gt; P = \Sigma_k \left\langle \dot Q_k \right\rangle
+ \Sigma_k \left\langle \dot H_k \right\rangle
- \Sigma_k \left\langle p_k\frac{\mathrm{d}V_k}{\mathrm{d}t} \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[angle bracket]]s denote time averages. The technical importance of the enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems, as formulated above.

==Diagrams==
Nowadays the enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained via commercial software. Practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form. There are many types of diagrams, such as hT diagrams, which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures and hp diagrams, which give ''h'' as function of ''p'' for various ''T''. One of the most common diagrams is the temperature-entropy diagram (Ts-diagram). An example is ''Fig.2'', which is the Ts-diagram of nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Figure composed with data obtained with RefProp, NIST Standard Reference Database 23&lt;/ref&gt; It gives the melting curve and saturated liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps. These diagrams are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer.

==Some basic applications==
The points a through h in Fig.2 play a role in the discussion in this Section.
:a ''T'' = 300 K, ''p'' = 1 bar, ''s'' = 6.85 kJ/(kgK), ''h'' = 461 kJ/kg;

:h ''T'' = 77.2 K, ''p'' = 1 bar, ''s'' = 5.41 kJ/(kgK), ''h'' =230 kJ/kg (saturated gas at 1 bar);

===Throttling===
{{main|Joule–Thomson effect}}
One of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process, also known as [[Joule–Thomson effect|Joule-Thomson expansion]]. It concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance (valve, porous plug, or any other type of flow resistance) as shown in Fig.3a. This process is very important since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the fridge. It is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers.

In the first law for open systems (see above), applied to the system in Fig.3a, all terms are zero except the terms for the enthalpy flow. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;0=\dot m h_1 - \dot m h_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the mass flow is constant the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same

:&lt;math&gt;h_1 = h_2&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling. The consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using Fig.2. Point c in Fig.2 is at 200 bar and room temperature (300 K). A Joule-Thomson expansion from 200 bar to 1 bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425 kJ/kg (not shown in Fig.2) lying between the 400 and 450 kJ/kg isenthalps and ends in point d, which is at a temperature of about 270 K. Hence the expansion from 200 bar to 1 bar cools nitrogen from 300 K to 270 K. In the valve there is a lot of friction and a lot of entropy is produced, but still the final temperature is below the starting value!

Point e is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with ''h'' = 100 kJ/kg. It corresponds roughly with ''p'' = 13 bar and ''T'' = 108 K. Throttling from this point to a pressure of one bar ends in the two-phase region (point f). This means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve. Since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter the enthalpy in f (''h''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to the enthalpy in g (''h''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied with the liquid fraction in f (''x''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) plus the enthalpy in h (''h''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied with the gas fraction in f (1-''x''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;). So

:&lt;math&gt; h_f = x_f h_g+(1-x_f)h_h.&lt;/math&gt;

With numbers: 100 = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; 28 + (1 – ''x''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)230 so ''x''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.64. This means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquid–gas mixture that leaves the throttling valve is 64%.

===Compressors===
{{main|Gas compressor}}
Fig.3b is a schematic drawing of a compressor. A power ''P'' is applied e.g. as electrical power. If the compression is adiabatic the gas temperature goes up. In the reversible case it would be at constant entropy, which corresponds with a vertical line in Fig.2. E.g. compressing nitrogen from 1 bar (point a) to 2 bar (point b) would result in a temperature increase from 300 K to 380 K. In order to let the compressed gas exit at ambient temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; heat exchange, e.g. by cooling water, is necessary. In the ideal case the compression is isothermal. The average heat flow to the surroundings is &lt;math&gt;\dot Q&lt;/math&gt;. Since the system is in the steady state the first law gives

:&lt;math&gt;0=-\dot Q + \dot m h_1 - \dot m h_2 + P.&lt;/math&gt;

The minimum power, needed for the compression is realized if the compression is reversible. In that case the [[second law of thermodynamics]] for open systems gives

:&lt;math&gt;0=-\frac{\dot Q}{T_a} + \dot m s_1 - \dot m s_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating &lt;math&gt;\dot Q&lt;/math&gt; gives for the minimum power

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_{\rm min}}{\dot m} = h_2-h_1 - T_a(s_2-s_1).&lt;/math&gt;

E.g. compressing 1&amp;nbsp;kg of nitrogen from 1 bar to 200 bar costs at least (''h''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; - ''h''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) - ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-''s''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;). With the data, obtained with Fig.2, we find a value of (430–461) – 300 (5.16–6.85) = 476 kJ/kg.

The relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_{\rm min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2(\mathrm{d}h-T_a\mathrm{d}s).&lt;/math&gt;

With d''h'' = ''T''d''s'' + ''v''d''p'' this results in the final relation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_{\rm min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2v\mathrm{d}p.&lt;/math&gt;

== Definitions==

===Gravitational mass and inertia===

A common misconception occurs between [[Center of mass|centre of mass and centre of gravity]].  They are defined in similar ways but are not exactly the same quantity. Centre of mass is the mathematical description of placing all the mass in the region considered to one position, centre of gravity is a real physical quantity, the point of a body where the gravitational force acts. They are equal if and only if the external gravitational field is uniform.

===Gravitoelectromagnetism===

In the weak-field and slow motion limit of general relativity, the phenomenon of [[gravitoelectromagnetism]] (in short &quot;GEM&quot;) occurs, creating a parallel between gravitation and [[electromagnetism]]. The ''gravitational field'' is the analogue of the [[electric field]], while the ''gravitomagnetic field'', which results from circulations of masses due to their [[angular momentum]], is the analogue of the magnetic field.

===Newtonian gravitational fields===

{{see also|Spherical polar coordinates}}

It can be shown that a uniform spherically symmetric mass distribution generates an equivalent gravitational field to a point mass, so all formulae for point masses apply to bodies which can be modelled in this way.

===Radiometry===

{{Main|Radiometry}}

[[File:Flux and solid angle.svg|right|275px|''275px''|thumb|Visulization of flux through differential area and solid angle. As always &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{n}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the unit normal to the incidant surface A, &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{\hat{n}}\mathrm{d}A \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{e}}_{\angle} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the direction of incident flux on the area element, ''θ'' is the angle between them. The factor &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{n}} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{e}}_{\angle} \mathrm{d}A = \mathbf{\hat{e}}_{\angle} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} = \cos \theta \mathrm{d}A \,\!&lt;/math&gt; arises when the flux is not normal to the surface element, so the area normal to the flux is reduced.]]

For spectral quantities two definitions are in use to refer to the same quantity, in terms of frequency or wavelength.

Subscripts 1 and 2 refer to initial and final optical media respectively.

These ratios are sometimes also used, following simply from other definitions of refractive index, wave phase velocity, and the luminal speed equation:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{v_2}{v_1} = \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_1 \mu_1}{\epsilon_2 \mu_2}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Astrophysics definitions==

In astrophysics, ''L'' is used for ''luminosity'' (energy per unit time, equivalent to ''power'') and ''F'' is used for ''energy flux'' (energy per unit time per unit area, equivalent to ''intensity'' in terms of area, not solid angle). They are not new quantities, simply different names.

This article summarizes [[equation]]s in the theory of [[electromagnetism]].

==Definitions==
[[File:Lorentz force particle.svg|200px|thumb|Lorentz force on a [[charged particle]] (of [[electric charge|charge]] ''q'') in motion (velocity '''v'''), used as the definition of the [[electric field|'''E''' field]] and [[magnetic field|'''B''' field]].]]

Here subscripts ''e'' and ''m'' are used to differ between [[electric charge|electric]] and [[magnetic charge]]s. The definitions for monopoles are of theoretical interest, although real magnetic dipoles can be described using pole strengths. There are two possible units for monopole strength, Wb (Weber) and A m (Ampere metre). Dimensional analysis shows that magnetic charges relate by ''q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''(Wb) = ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''(Am).

[[File:Universal charge distribution.svg|200px|right|thumb|Continuous charge distribution. The volume charge density ρ is the amount of charge per unit volume (cube), surface charge density σ is amount per unit surface area (circle) with outward [[unit normal]] '''n̂''', '''d''' is the [[electric dipole moment|dipole moment]] between two point charges, the volume density of these is the [[polarization density]] '''P'''. [[Position vector]] '''r''' is a point to calculate the [[electric field]]; '''r&amp;prime;''' is a point in the charged object.]]

Contrary to the strong analogy between (classical) [[gravitation]] and [[electrostatics]], there are no &quot;centre of charge&quot; or &quot;centre of electrostatic attraction&quot; analogues.

[[File:General flux diagram.svg|thumb|300px|Flux '''F''' through a [[surface]], d'''S''' is the [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] [[vector area]] element, '''n''' is the [[unit normal]] to the surface. '''Left:''' No flux passes in the surface, the maximum amount flows normal to the surface. '''Right:''' The reduction in flux passing through a surface can be visualized by reduction in '''F''' or d'''S''' equivalently (resolved into [[Euclidean vector#Decomposition|components]], θ is angle to normal '''n'''). '''F'''•d'''S''' is the component of flux passing though the surface, multiplied by the area of the surface (see [[dot product]]). For this reason flux represents physically a flow ''per unit area''.]]

Here &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{t}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the direction of the flow/current/flux.

The general form of [[wavefunction]] for a system of particles, each with position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and z-component of spin ''s&lt;sub&gt;z i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Sums are over the discrete variable ''s&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'', integrals over continuous positions '''r'''.

For clarity and brevity, the coordinates are collected into tuples, the indices label the particles (which cannot be done physically, but is mathematically necessary). Following are general mathematical results, used in calculations.

===General fundamental quantities===

{{main|Transverse wave|Longitudinal wave}}

A wave can be [[Longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] where the oscillations are parallel (or antiparallel) to the propagation direction, or [[Transverse wave|transverse]] where the oscillations are perpendicular to the propagation direction. These oscillations are characterized by a periodically time-varying displacement in the parallel or perpendicular direction, and so the instantaneous velocity and acceleration are also periodic and time varying in these directions. But the wave profile (the apparent motion of the wave due to the successive oscillations of particles or fields about their equilibrium positions) propagates at the phase and group velocities parallel or antiparallel to the propagation direction, which is common to longitudinal and transverse waves. Below oscillatory displacement, velocity and acceleration refer to the kinematics in the oscillating directions of the wave - transverse or longitudinal (mathematical description is identical), the group and phase velocities are separate.

===Wave propagation===

A common misconception occurs between phase velocity and group velocity (analogous to centres of mass and gravity). They happen to be equal in non-dispersive media. In dispersive media the phase velocity is not necessarily the same as the group velocity. The phase velocity varies with frequency. 

:The ''phase'' velocity is the rate at which the phase of the wave propagates in space.
:The ''group'' velocity is the rate at which the wave envelope, i.e. the changes in amplitude, propagates. The wave envelope is the profile of the wave amplitudes; all transverse displacements are bound by the envelope profile.

Intuitively the wave envelope is the &quot;global profile&quot; of the wave, which &quot;contains&quot; changing &quot;local profiles inside the global profile&quot;. Each propagates at generally different speeds determined by the important function called the ''[[Dispersion Relation]]''. The use of the explicit form ''ω''(''k'') is standard, since the phase velocity ''ω''/''k'' and the group velocity d''ω''/d''k'' usually have convenient representations by this function.

The transverse displacements are simply the real parts of the complex amplitudes. 

'''1-dimensional corollaries for two sinusoidal waves'''

The following may be deduced by applying the principle of superposition to two sinusoidal waves, using trigonometric identities. The ''angle addition'' and ''sum-to-product'' trigonometric formulae are useful; in more advanced work complex numbers and fourier series and transforms are used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17045">A '''physical quantity''' (or &quot;physical magnitude&quot;) is a [[physical property]] of a [[phenomenon]], body, or substance, that can be [[Quantification (science)|quantified]] by [[measurement]].&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology (JCGM), ''International Vocabulary of Metrology, Basic and General Concepts and Associated Terms'' (''VIM''), III ed., Pavillon de Breteuil : JCGM 200:2012 ([http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf on-line])&lt;/ref&gt; A physical quantity can be expressed as the combination of a [[number]] – usually a [[real number]] – and a [[unit (measurement)|unit]] or combination of units; for example, {{val|1.6749275|e=-27|ul=kilogram}} (the [[Invariant mass|mass]] of the [[neutron]]), or {{val|299792458|ul=metres per second}} (the [[speed of light]]).

==Symbols, nomenclature==
'''''General''''': Symbols for quantities should be chosen according to the international recommendations from [[ISO/IEC 80000]], the [[IUPAP red book]] and the [[IUPAC green book]]. For example, the recommended symbol for the physical quantity 'mass' is ''m'', and the recommended symbol for the quantity 'charge' is ''Q''.

'''''Subscripts and indices'''''

Subscripts are used for two reasons, to simply attach a name to the quantity or associate it with another quantity, or represent a specific vector, matrix, or tensor component.

:'''''Name reference''''': The quantity has a [[subscript]]ed or [[superscript]]ed single letter, a number of letters, or an entire word, to specify what concept or entity they refer to, and tend to be written in upright roman typeface rather than italic while the quantity is in italic. For instance ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; or ''E''&lt;sub&gt;kinetic&lt;/sub&gt; is usually used to denote [[kinetic energy]] and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; or ''E''&lt;sub&gt;potential&lt;/sub&gt; is usually used to denote [[potential energy]].

:'''''Quantity reference''''': The quantity has a [[subscript]]ed or [[superscript]]ed single letter, a number of letters, or an entire word, to specify what measurement/s they refer to, and tend to be written in italic rather than upright roman typeface while the quantity is also in italic. For example ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''c&lt;sub&gt;isobaric&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[heat capacity]] at constant [[pressure]].

:Note the difference in the style of the subscripts: k and p are abbreviations of the words kinetic and potential, whereas ''p'' (italic) is the symbol for the physical quantity ''pressure'' rather than an abbreviation of the word &quot;pressure&quot;.

:'''''Indices''''': These are quite apart from the above, their use is for mathematical formalism, see [[Index notation]].

'''''Scalars''''': [[Symbol]]s for physical quantities are usually chosen to be a single letter of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] or [[Greek alphabet]], and are printed in italic type.

'''''Vectors''''': Symbols for physical quantities that are vectors are in bold type, underlined or with an arrow above. If, e.g., ''u'' is the speed of a particle, then the straightforward notation for its velocity is '''u''', &lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\vec{u}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''Numbers and elementary functions'''''

Numerical quantities, even those denoted by letters, are usually printed in roman (upright) type, though sometimes can be italic. Symbols for elementary functions (circular trigonometric, hyperbolic, logarithmic etc.), changes in a quantity like Δ in Δ''y'' or operators like d in d''x'', are also recommended to be printed in roman type.

:'''Examples'''

:real numbers are as usual, such as 1 or √2,
:e for the base of natural logarithm,
:i for the imaginary unit,
:π for 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...
: δ''x'', Δ''y'', d''z'',
:sin ''&amp;alpha;'', sinh ''&amp;gamma;'', log ''x''

==Units and dimensions==
'''''Units'''''

Most physical quantities include a [[physical unit|unit]], but not all – some are dimensionless. Neither the name of a physical quantity, nor the symbol used to denote it, implies a particular choice of unit, though [[SI]] [[Units of measurement|units]] are usually preferred and assumed today due to their ease of use and all-round applicability. For example, a quantity of mass might be represented by the symbol ''m'', and could be expressed in the units [[kilogram]]s (kg), [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb), or [[Atomic mass unit|daltons]] (Da).

'''''Dimensions'''''

{{Main|dimensional analysis}}

The notion of ''[[physical dimension]]'' of a physical quantity was introduced by [[Joseph Fourier]] in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Fourier, Joseph. ''[[Théorie analytique de la chaleur]]'', Firmin Didot, Paris, 1822. (In this book, Fourier introduces the concept of ''physical dimensions'' for the physical quantities.)&lt;/ref&gt; By convention, physical quantities are organized in a dimensional system built upon base quantities, each of which is regarded as having its own dimension.

==Base quantities==
{{Main|International System of Quantities}}
Base quantities are those quantities on the basis of which other quantities can be expressed. The seven base quantities of the [[International System of Quantities]] (ISQ) and their corresponding [[SI]] units and dimensions are listed in the following table. Other conventions may have a different number of [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]]s (e.g. the [[CGS]] and [[Mks system of units|MKS]] systems of units).

The last two angular units, [[plane angle]] and [[solid angle]], are subsidiary units used in the SI, but are treated as dimensionless. The subsidiary units are used for convenience to differentiate between a ''truly dimensionless'' quantity (pure number) and an ''angle'', which are different measurements.

==General derived quantities==
Derived quantities are those whose definitions are based on other physical quantities(base quantities).

===Space===
Important applied base units for space and time are below. [[Area]] and [[volume]] are of course derived from length, but included for completeness as they occur frequently in many derived quantities, in particular densities.

|-
| Volume 
| ''τ'', ''V'' 
| m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 
| L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|}

===Densities, flows, gradients, and moments===
Important and convenient derived quantities such as densities, [[flux]]es, [[Fluid dynamics|flows]], [[Electric current|current]]s are associated with many quantities. Sometimes different terms such as ''current density'' and ''flux density'', ''rate'', ''frequency'' and ''current'', are used interchangeably in the same context, sometimes they are used uniqueley.

To clarify these effective template derived quantities, we let ''q'' be ''any'' quantity within some scope of context (not necessarily base quantities) and present in the table below some of the most commonly used symbols where applicable, their definitions, usage, SI units and SI dimensions – where [q] is the dimension of ''q''.

For time derivatives, specific, molar, and flux densities of quantities there is no one symbol, nomenclature depends on subject, though time derivatives can be generally written using overdot notation. For generality we use ''q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', and '''F''' respectively. No symbol is necessarily required for the gradient of a scalar field, since only the [[Del|nabla/del operator]] ∇ or [[Gradient|grad]] needs to be written. For spatial density, current, current density and flux, the notations are common from one context to another, differing only by a change in subscripts.

For current density, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{t}}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the direction of flow, i.e. tangent to a flowline. Notice the dot product with the unit normal for a surface, since the amount of current passing through the surface is reduced when the current is not normal to the area. Only the current passing perpendicular to the surface contributes to the current passing ''through'' the surface, no current passes ''in'' the (tangential) plane of the surface.

The calculus notations below can be used synonymously.

If ''X'' is a [[Multivariable calculus|''n''-variable]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt; X \equiv X \left ( x_1, x_2 \cdots x_n \right ) &lt;/math&gt;, then:

:'''''Differential''''' The differential [[n-dimensional space|''n''-space]] [[volume element]] is &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}^n x \equiv \mathrm{d} V_n \equiv \mathrm{d} x_1 \mathrm{d} x_2 \cdots \mathrm{d} x_n  &lt;/math&gt;,

:'''''Integral''''': The [[Multiple integral|''multiple'' integral]] of ''X'' over the ''n''-space volume is &lt;math&gt; \int X \mathrm{d}^n x \equiv \int X \mathrm{d} V_n \equiv \int \cdots \int \int X \mathrm{d} x_1 \mathrm{d} x_2 \cdots \mathrm{d} x_n  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The meaning of the term physical ''quantity'' is generally well understood (everyone understands what is meant by ''the frequency of a periodic phenomenon'', or ''the resistance of an electric wire''). The term ''physical quantity'' does not imply a physically ''invariant quantity''. ''Length'' for example is a ''physical quantity'', yet it is variant under coordinate change in special and general relativity. The notion of physical quantities is so basic and intuitive in the realm of science, that it does not need to be explicitly ''spelled out'' or even ''mentioned''. It is universally understood that scientists will (more often than not) deal with quantitative data, as opposed to qualitative data. Explicit mention and discussion of ''physical quantities'' is not part of any standard science program, and is more suited for a ''philosophy of science'' or ''philosophy'' program.
 
The notion of ''physical quantities'' is seldom used in physics, nor is it part of the standard physics vernacular. The idea is often misleading, as its name implies &quot;a quantity that can be physically measured&quot;, yet is often incorrectly used to mean a physical invariant. Due to the rich complexity of physics, many different fields possess different physical invariants. There is no known physical invariant sacred in all possible fields of physics. Energy, space, momentum, torque, position, and length (just to name a few) are all found to be experimentally variant in some particular scale and system. Additionally, the notion that it is possible to measure &quot;physical quantities&quot; comes into question, particular in quantum field theory and normalization techniques. As infinities are produced by the theory, the actual “measurements” made are not really those of the physical universe (as we cannot measure infinities), they are those of the renormalization scheme which is expressly depended on our measurement scheme, coordinate system and metric system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3720">[[Image:Lux meter.jpg|thumb|right|A lux meter for measuring illuminances in work environments.]]
In [[photometry (optics)|photometry]], '''illuminance''' is the total [[luminous flux]] incident on a surface, per unit [[area]]. It is a measure of how much the incident [[light]] illuminates the surface, wavelength-weighted by the [[luminosity function]] to correlate with human brightness perception. Similarly, '''luminous emittance''' is the luminous flux per unit area emitted from a surface. Luminous emittance is also known as '''luminous exitance'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drdrbill.com/downloads/optics/photometry/Exitance.pdf Luminous exitance] ''Drdrbill.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3 illuminance.PNG|thumb|Illuminance]]
In [[SI derived units]] these are measured in [[lux]] (lx) or [[lumen (unit)|lumens]] per [[square metre]] ([[candela|cd]]·[[steradian|sr]]·[[meter|m]]&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). In the [[CGS]] system, the unit of illuminance is the [[phot]], which is equal to {{gaps|10|000|u=lux}}. The [[foot-candle]] is a non-metric unit of illuminance that is used in [[photography]].&lt;ref&gt;One phot = {{gaps|929.030|400|001|u=foot-candles}}, according to http://www.unitconversion.org/unit_converter/illumination.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Illuminance was formerly often called [[brightness]], but this leads to confusion with other uses of the word, such as to mean [[luminance]]. &quot;Brightness&quot; should never be used for quantitative description, but only for nonquantitative references to physiological sensations and perceptions of light.

The human eye is capable of seeing somewhat more than a 2 trillion-fold range: The presence of white objects is somewhat discernible under starlight, at {{val|5|e=-5|u=lux}}, while at the bright end, it is possible to read large text at 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; lux, or about 1000 times that of direct [[sunlight]], although this can be very uncomfortable and cause long-lasting [[afterimage]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Astronomy==
In [[astronomy]], the illuminance stars cast on the Earth's atmosphere is used as a measure of their brightness. The usual units are [[apparent magnitude]]s in the visible band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/radfaq.html#7 |title=Radiometry and photmetry in astronomy FAQ, section 7 |first=Paul |last=Schlyter}}&lt;/ref&gt; V-magnitudes can be converted to lux using the formula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.ziggo.nl/jhm.vangastel/Astronomy/Formules.pdf |title=Formulae for converting to and from astronomy-relevant units |accessdate=Nov 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{v} = 10^{(-14.18-M_\mathrm{v})/2.5}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the illuminance in lux, and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the apparent magnitude. The reverse conversion is
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{v} = -14.18-2.5 \log(E_\mathrm{v})&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Young's modulus''', which is also known as the [[modulus of elasticity|elastic modulus]], is a mechanical property of [[linear elasticity|linear]] [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] solid materials. It defines the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (proportional deformation) in a material.

Young's modulus is named after the 19th-century British scientist [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]. However, the concept was developed in 1727 by [[Leonhard Euler]], and the first experiments that used the concept of Young's modulus in its current form were performed by the Italian scientist [[Giordano Riccati]] in 1782, pre-dating Young's work by 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rational Mechanics of Flexible or Elastic Bodies, 1638–1788'': Introduction to Leonhardi Euleri Opera Omnia, vol. X and XI, Seriei Secundae.  Orell Fussli.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term modulus is the [[diminutive]] of the Latin term ''modus'' which means ''measure''.

A solid body deforms when a load is applied to it.  If the material is elastic, the body returns to its original shape after the load is removed.  The material is linear if the ratio of load to deformation remains constant during the loading process.  Not many materials are linear and elastic beyond a small amount of deformation.  A constant Young's modulus applies only to linear elastic materials.  A perfectly rigid material has an infinite Young's modulus because an infinite force is needed to deform such a material. A material whose Young's modulus is very high can be approximated as rigid.&lt;ref&gt;In computer graphics visual effects, the terms ''linear elastic material'' and ''rigid material'' are used interchangeably if the Young's modulus is high.&lt;/ref&gt;

A stiff material needs more force to deform compared to a soft material.  Therefore, the Young's modulus is a measure of the [[stiffness]] of a solid material.  Do not confuse:
* stiffness and [[Strength of materials|strength]]: the strength of material is the amount of force it can withstand and still recover its original shape;
* material stiffness and geometric [[stiffness]]: the geometric stiffness depends on shape, e.g. the stiffness of an [[I beam]] is much higher than that of a spring made of the same steel thus having the same rigidity;
* stiffness and [[hardness]]: the hardness of a material defines the relative resistance that its surface imposes against the penetration of a harder body;
* stiffness and [[toughness]]: toughness is the amount of energy that a material can absorb before fracturing.

==Technical==
The technical definition is: the ratio of the [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] (force per unit area) along an [[Cartesian coordinate system|axis]] to the [[strain (materials science)|strain]] (ratio of deformation over initial length) along that axis in the range of stress in which [[Hooke's law]] holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus), ''E''|file=M03966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young's modulus is the most common ''[[elastic modulus]]'', sometimes called the ''modulus of elasticity'', but there are other elastic moduli such as the [[bulk modulus]] and the [[shear modulus]].

===Units===
Young's modulus is the ratio of [[stress (physics)|stress]] (which has units of [[pressure]]) to [[strain (materials science)|strain]] (which is [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]]), and so Young's modulus has units of [[pressure]]. Its [[SI]] unit is therefore the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa or [[newton (unit)|N]]/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;·kg·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The practical units used are megapascals (MPa or [[newton (unit)|N]]/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or gigapascals (GPa or kN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In [[United States customary units]], it is expressed as [[pounds per square inch|pounds (force) per square inch]] (psi).  The abbreviation '''ksi''' refers to &quot;kpsi&quot;, or thousands of pounds per square inch.

== Usage ==
The Young's modulus enables the calculation of the change in the dimension of a bar made of an [[isotropic]] elastic material under tensile or compressive loads.  For instance, it predicts how much a material sample extends under tension or shortens under compression. The Young's modulus directly applies to cases of uniaxial stress, that is tensile or compressive stress in one direction and no stress in the other directions. Young's modulus is also used in order to predict the deflection that will occur in a [[statically determinate#Statically determinate|statically determinate]] [[beam (structure)|beam]] when a load is applied at a point in between the beam's supports. Other elastic calculations usually require the use of one additional elastic property, such as the [[shear modulus]], [[bulk modulus]] or [[Poisson's ratio]]. Any two of these parameters are sufficient to fully describe elasticity in an isotropic material.

===Linear versus non-linear===
Young's modulus represents the factor of proportionality in [[Hooke's law]], which relates the stress and the strain. However, Hooke's law is only valid under the assumption of an ''elastic'' and ''linear'' response. Any real material will eventually fail and break when stretched over a very large distance or with a very large force; however all solid materials exhibit nearly Hookean behavior for small enough strains or stresses. If the range over which Hooke's law is valid is large enough compared to the typical stress that one expects to apply to the material, the material is said to be linear. Otherwise (if the typical stress one would apply is outside the linear range) the material is said to be non-linear.

[[Steel]], [[carbon (fiber)|carbon fiber]] and [[glass]] among others are usually considered linear materials, while other materials such as [[rubber]] and [[soils]] are non-linear. However, this is not an absolute classification: if very small stresses or strains are applied to a non-linear material, the response will be linear, but if very high stress or strain is applied to a linear material, the linear theory will not be enough. For example, as the linear theory implies [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversibility]], it would be absurd to use the linear theory to describe the failure of a steel bridge under a high load; although steel is a linear material for most applications, it is not in such a case of catastrophic failure.

In [[solid mechanics]], the slope of the [[stress–strain curve]] at any point is called the [[tangent modulus]]. It can be experimentally determined from the [[slope]] of a stress–strain curve created during [[tensile test]]s conducted on a sample of the material.  The tangent modulus of the initial, linear portion of a stress–strain curve is called ''Young's modulus''.

===Directional materials===

Young's modulus is not always the same in all orientations of a material. Most metals and ceramics, along with many other materials, are [[isotropy|isotropic]], and their mechanical properties are the same in all orientations. However, metals and ceramics can be treated with certain impurities, and metals can be mechanically worked to make their grain structures directional. These materials then become [[anisotropy|anisotropic]], and Young's modulus will change depending on the direction of the force vector. Anisotropy can be seen in many composites as well. For example, [[carbon (fiber)|carbon fiber]] has much higher Young's modulus (is much stiffer) when force is loaded parallel to the fibers (along the grain).  Other such materials include [[wood]] and [[reinforced concrete]]. Engineers can use this directional phenomenon to their advantage in creating structures.

== Calculation ==

Young's modulus, ''E'', can be calculated by dividing the [[Stress (physics)|tensile stress]] by the [[strain (physics)|extensional strain]] in the elastic (initial, linear) portion of the [[stress–strain curve]]:

:&lt;math&gt; E \equiv \frac{\mbox {tensile stress}}{\mbox {extensional strain}} = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}= \frac{F/A_0}{\Delta L/L_0} = \frac{F L_0} {A_0 \Delta L} &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt; is the Young's modulus (modulus of elasticity)
:&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt; is the force exerted on an object under tension;
:&lt;var&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; is the original cross-sectional area through which the force is applied;
:&lt;var&gt;ΔL&lt;/var&gt; is the amount by which the length of the object changes;
:&lt;var&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; is the original length of the object.

===Force exerted by stretched or contracted material ===

The Young's modulus of a material can be used to calculate the force it exerts under specific strain.

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{E A_0 \Delta L} {L_0}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt; is the force exerted by the material when contracted or stretched by &lt;var&gt;ΔL&lt;/var&gt;.

[[Hooke's law]] can be derived from this formula, which describes the stiffness of an ideal spring: 
:&lt;math&gt;F = \left( \frac{E A_0} {L_0} \right) \Delta L = k x \,&lt;/math&gt;
where it comes in saturation
:&lt;math&gt;k = \begin{matrix} \frac {E A_0} {L_0} \end{matrix} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = \Delta L. \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Elastic potential energy===

The [[elastic potential energy]] stored is given by the integral of this expression with respect to &lt;var&gt;L&lt;/var&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;U_e = \int {\frac{E A_0 \Delta L} {L_0}}\, d\Delta L = \frac {E A_0} {L_0} \int { \Delta L }\, d\Delta L = \frac {E A_0 {\Delta L}^2} {2 L_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt; is the elastic potential energy.

The elastic potential energy per unit volume is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U_e} {A_0 L_0} = \frac {E {\Delta L}^2} {2 L_0^2} = \frac {1} {2} E {\varepsilon}^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \frac {\Delta L} {L_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the strain in the material.M

This formula can also be expressed as the integral of Hooke's law:

:&lt;math&gt;U_e = \int {k x}\, dx = \frac {1} {2} k x^2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Relation among elastic constants===
For homogeneous isotropic materials [[Elastic modulus|simple relations]] exist between elastic constants (Young's modulus ''E'', [[shear modulus]] ''G'', [[bulk modulus]] ''K'', and [[Poisson's ratio]] ''ν'') that allow calculating them all as long as two are known:
:&lt;math&gt;E = 2G(1+\nu) = 3K(1-2\nu).\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Approximate values ==
[[Image:SpiderGraph YoungMod.gif|350px|thumb|Influences of selected glass component additions on Young's modulus of a specific base glass]]

Young's modulus can vary somewhat due to differences in sample composition and test method. The rate of deformation has the greatest impact on the data collected, especially in polymers. The values here are approximate and only meant for relative comparison.

{{refimprove|date=January 2011}}

In [[materials science]] and [[metallurgy]], '''toughness''' is the ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing.&lt;ref name=NDT&gt;[http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Materials/Mechanical/Toughness.htm &quot;Toughness&quot;], [http://www.ndt-ed.org/index_flash.htm NDT Education Resource Center], Brian Larson, Editor, 2001-2011, The Collaboration for NDT Education, [[Iowa State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; One definition of material toughness is the amount of [[energy]] per unit volume that a material can absorb before [[rupture (engineering)|rupturing]]. It is also defined as a material's resistance to [[fracture]] when [[stress (physics)|stressed]].

Toughness requires a balance of [[Strength of materials|strength]] and [[ductility]].&lt;ref name=NDT/&gt;

==Mathematical definition==
Toughness can be determined by [[Integration (mathematics)|integrating]] the [[stress-strain curve]].&lt;ref name=NDT/&gt; It is the energy of mechanical deformation per unit volume prior to fracture. The explicit mathematical description is:

: &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{\mbox{energy}}{\mbox{volume}} = \int_{0}^{\epsilon_f} \sigma\, d\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{} &lt;/math&gt; is strain
* &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_f &lt;/math&gt; is the strain upon failure
* &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is stress

Another definition is the ability to absorb [[mechanical energy]] up to the point of failure. The area under the stress-strain curve is called toughness.

If the upper limit of integration up to the yield point is restricted, the energy absorbed per unit volume is known as the [[Resilience (materials science)|modulus of resilience]]. Mathematically, the modulus of resilience can be expressed by the product of the square of the yield stress divided by two times the Young's modulus of elasticity. That is,
: Modulus of resilience = {{sfrac|Yield stress&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2 (Young's modulus)}}

==Toughness tests==
The toughness of a material can be measured using a small specimen of that material. A typical testing machine uses a pendulum to strike the specimen and deform it. The height from which the pendulum fell, minus the height to which it rose after deforming the specimen, multiplied by the weight of the pendulum is a measure of the energy absorbed by the specimen as it was deformed during the impact with the pendulum. The [[Charpy impact test|Charpy]] and [[Izod impact strength test|Izod impact tests]] are typical measures of toughness.

==Unit of toughness==
Tensile toughness (or, ''deformation energy'', ''U''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) is measured in units of [[joule]] per [[cubic metre]] (J·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) in the [[SI]] system and inch-[[pound-force]] per [[cubic inch]] (in·lbf·in&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) in [[US customary units]].&lt;br /&gt;
1.00&amp;nbsp;N·m.m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; ≃ {{gaps|0.000|145}}&amp;nbsp;in·{{lbf}}·in&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.00&amp;nbsp;in·{{lbf}}·in&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; ≃ 6.89&amp;nbsp;kN·m.m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.

In the [[SI]] system, the unit of tensile toughness can be easily calculated by using area underneath the stress–strain (''σ''–''ε'') curve, which gives tensile toughness value, as given below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O.Balkan and H.Demirer|title=Polym. Compos.|volume=31|page=1285|year=2010|ISSN=1548-0569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''U''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = Area underneath the stress–strain (''σ''–''ε'') curve = ''σ'' × ''ε''
:''U''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = MPa × % = (N·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)·(m·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:''U''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = N·m·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;·10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
:'''''U''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = J·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;·10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''

==Toughness and strength==
Toughness can also be defined with respect to regions of a stress-strain diagram. Toughness is related to the area under the stress-strain curve. In order to be tough, a material must be both strong and ductile. For example, brittle materials (like ceramics) that are strong but with limited ductility are not tough; conversely, very ductile materials with low strengths are also not tough. To be tough, a material should withstand both high stresses and high strains. Generally speaking, strength indicates how much force the material can support, while toughness indicates how much energy a material can absorb before rupturing.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}

The '''amplitude''' of a [[Periodic function|period]]ic [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] is a measure of its change over a single [[Period (mathematics)|period]] (such as [[period (physics)|time]] or [[Wavelength|spatial period]]). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's [[Maxima and minima|extreme values]].  In older texts the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] is sometimes called the amplitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1=Knopp, Konrad| author2= Bagemihl, Frederick | authorlink1=Konrad Knopp | title=Theory of Functions Parts I and II | year=1996 | publisher=Dover Publications | isbn=978-0-486-69219-7 | page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions of the term==
[[File:Sine voltage.svg|thumb|A [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] curve&lt;br /&gt;1 = Peak amplitude (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\hat U&lt;/math&gt;),&lt;br /&gt;2 = Peak-to-peak amplitude (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle2\hat U&lt;/math&gt;),&lt;br /&gt;3 = Root mean square amplitude (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\hat U/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;),&lt;br /&gt;4 = [[Wave period]] (not an amplitude)]]

===Peak-to-peak amplitude=== 
{{redirect|Peak to peak|the school|Peak to Peak Charter School}}

Peak-to-peak amplitude is the change between peak (highest amplitude value) and [[Crest (physics)|trough]] (lowest amplitude value, which can be negative). With appropriate circuitry, peak-to-peak amplitudes of electric oscillations can be measured by meters or by viewing the waveform on an [[oscilloscope]]. Peak-to-peak is a straightforward measurement on an oscilloscope, the peaks of the waveform being easily identified and measured against the [[Oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]]. This remains a common way of specifying amplitude, but sometimes other measures of amplitude are more appropriate.

===Peak amplitude===
In [[audio system measurements]], [[telecommunications]] and other areas where the [[wikt:measurand|measurand]] is a signal that swings above and below a zero value but is not [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]], peak amplitude is often used. This is the maximum [[absolute value]] of the signal.

===Semi-amplitude===
&lt;!-- This section is the target of [[Semi-amplitude]] --&gt;
Semi-amplitude means half the peak-to-peak amplitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatum&quot;&gt;Tatum, J. B. ''[http://orca.phys.uvic.ca/~tatum/celmechs/celm18.pdf Physics&amp;nbsp;– Celestial Mechanics].'' Paragraph 18.2.12. 2007. Retrieved 2008-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the most widely used measure of orbital amplitude in [[astronomy]] and the measurement of small semi-amplitudes of nearby stars is important in the search for [[exoplanet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Goldvais, Uriel A. [http://img2.tapuz.co.il/forums/1_109580628.pdf Exoplanets], pp. 2–3. Retrieved 2008-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists&lt;ref&gt;Regents of the [[University of California]]. ''[http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/light/measure_amp.html#measure4 Universe of Light: What is the Amplitude of a Wave?]'' 1996. Retrieved 2008-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt; use &quot;amplitude&quot; or &quot;peak amplitude&quot; to mean semi-amplitude, that is, half the peak-to-peak amplitude.

===Root mean square amplitude===
[[Root mean square]] (RMS) amplitude is used especially in [[electrical engineering]]: the RMS is defined as the [[square root]] of the [[mean]] over time of the square of the vertical distance of the graph from the rest state.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Communicative Disorders [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. ''[http://www.comdis.wisc.edu/vcd202/rms.html  RMS Amplitude]''. Retrieved 2008-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

For complicated waveforms, especially non-repeating signals like noise, the RMS amplitude is usually used because it is both unambiguous and has physical significance. For example, the ''average'' [[power (physics)|power]] transmitted by an acoustic or [[electromagnetic wave]] or by an electrical signal is proportional to the square of the RMS amplitude (and not, in general, to the square of the peak amplitude).&lt;ref&gt;Ward, ''Electrical Engineering Science'', pp. 141–142, McGraw-Hill, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[alternating current]] [[electric power]], the  universal practice is to specify RMS values of a sinusoidal waveform. One property of root mean square voltages and currents is that they produce the same heating effect as [[direct current]] in a given resistance.

The peak-to-peak voltage of a sine wave is about 2.8 times the RMS value. The peak-to-peak value is used, for example, when choosing rectifiers for power supplies, or when estimating the maximum voltage that insulation must withstand.  Some common [[voltmeter]]s are calibrated for RMS amplitude, but respond to the average value of a rectified waveform.  Many digital voltmeters and all moving coil meters are in this category.  The RMS calibration is only correct for a sine wave input since the ratio between peak, average and RMS values is dependent on [[waveform]].  If the wave shape being measured is greatly different from a sine wave, the relationship between RMS and average value changes. True RMS-responding meters were used in [[radio frequency]] measurements, where instruments measured the heating effect in a resistor to measure current. The advent of [[microprocessor]] controlled meters capable of calculating RMS by [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] the waveform has made true RMS measurement commonplace.

===Ambiguity===
In general,  the use of peak amplitude is simple and unambiguous only for symmetric periodic waves, like a sine wave, a [[square wave]], or a triangular wave. For an asymmetric wave (periodic pulses in one direction, for example), the peak amplitude becomes ambiguous.  This is because the value is different depending on whether the maximum positive signal is measured relative to the mean, the maximum negative signal is measured relative to the mean, or the maximum positive signal is measured relative to the maximum negative signal (the ''peak-to-peak amplitude'') and then divided by two.  In electrical engineering, the usual solution to this ambiguity is to measure the amplitude from a defined reference potential (such as [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] or 0&amp;nbsp;V).  Strictly speaking, this is no longer amplitude since there is the possibility that a constant (DC component) is included in the measurement.

===Pulse amplitude===
In [[telecommunication]], ''pulse amplitude'' is the magnitude of a [[pulse (signal processing)|pulse]] parameter, such as the [[voltage]] level, [[Electric current|current]] level, [[field intensity]], or [[Power (physics)|power]] level.

Pulse amplitude is measured with respect to a specified reference and therefore should be modified by qualifiers, such as &quot;average&quot;, &quot;instantaneous&quot;, &quot;peak&quot;, or &quot;root-mean-square&quot;.

Pulse amplitude also applies to the amplitude of [[frequency]]- and [[phase (waves)|phase]]-modulated [[waveform]] envelopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal representation==
In this simple [[wave equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;
x = A \sin(\omega (t - K)) + b \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;

''A'' is the peak amplitude of the wave,&lt;br /&gt;
''x'' is the oscillating variable,&lt;br /&gt;
ω is [[angular frequency]],&lt;br /&gt;
''t'' is time,&lt;br /&gt;
''K'' and ''b'' are arbitrary constants representing time and displacement offsets respectively.

==Units==
The units of the amplitude depend on the type of wave, but are always in the same units as the oscillating variable.  A more general representation of the wave equation is more complex, but the role of amplitude remains analogous to this simple case.

For waves on a [[vibrating string|string]], or in medium such as [[water]], the amplitude is a [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]].

The amplitude of sound waves and audio signals (which relates to the volume) conventionally refers to the amplitude of the [[Sound#Sound pressure level|air pressure]] in the wave, but sometimes the amplitude of the [[Particle displacement|displacement]] (movements of the air or the diaphragm of a [[loudspeaker|speaker]]) is described. The [[logarithm]] of the amplitude squared is usually quoted in [[decibel|dB]], so a null amplitude corresponds to −[[infinity|∞]]&amp;nbsp;dB. [[Loudness]] is related to amplitude and [[Sound intensity|intensity]] and is one of most salient qualities of a sound, although in general sounds can be recognized [[Amplitude scaling invariance|independently of amplitude]].  The square of the amplitude is proportional to the intensity of the wave.

For [[electromagnetic radiation]], the amplitude of a photon corresponds to the changes in the [[electric field]] of the wave.  However radio signals may be carried by electromagnetic radiation; the intensity of the radiation ([[amplitude modulation]]) or the frequency of the radiation ([[frequency modulation]]) is oscillated and then the individual oscillations are varied (modulated) to produce the signal.

==Waveform and envelope==
{{main|Envelope (waves)}}
The amplitude as defined above is a constant and the wave is said to be wave length [[continuous wave|continuous]]. If this condition does not hold, amplitude alike variations with time and/or position may be quantified in terms of the [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the wave.

==Sinusoids==
If the [[waveform]] is a pure [[sine wave]], the relationships between peak-to-peak, peak, mean, and [[Root mean square|RMS]] amplitudes are fixed and known, as they are for any continuous [[Period (physics)|periodic]] wave.  However, this is not true for an arbitrary waveform which may or may not be periodic or continuous.

For a sine wave, the relationship between RMS and peak-to-peak amplitude is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{Peak-to-peak} = 2 \sqrt{2} \times \mbox{RMS} \approx 2.8 \times \mbox{RMS} \,
&lt;/math&gt;.
See [[Root mean square#RMS of common waveforms]] for more.

For other waveforms the relationships are not (necessarily) arithmetically the same as they are for sine waves.

{{Classical mechanics |fundamentals |width=20.55em}}

In [[classical mechanics]], '''linear momentum''' or '''translational momentum''' ([[plural|pl.]] momenta; [[SI]] unit [[kilogram|kg]]&amp;nbsp;[[meters per second|m/s]], or equivalently, [[newton (unit)|N]]&amp;nbsp;[[second|s]]) is the product of the [[mass]] and [[velocity]] of an object. For example, a heavy truck moving rapidly has a large momentum—it takes a large or prolonged force to get the truck up to this speed, and it takes a large or prolonged force to bring it to a stop afterwards. If the truck were lighter, or moving more slowly, then it would have less momentum.

Like velocity, linear momentum is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity, possessing a direction as well as a magnitude:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{v},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''p'''}} is the three-dimensional vector stating the object's momentum in the three directions of three-dimensional space, {{math|'''v'''}} is the three-dimensional velocity vector giving the object's rate of movement in each direction, and {{math|''m''}} is the object's mass.

Linear momentum is also a ''conserved'' quantity, meaning that if a [[closed system]] is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change. 

In classical mechanics, [[#Conservation|conservation of linear momentum]]  is implied by [[Newton's laws]]. It also holds in [[special relativity]] (with a modified formula) and, with appropriate definitions, a (generalized) linear momentum [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] holds in [[electrodynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]], and [[general relativity]]. It is ultimately an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time, that of [[translational symmetry]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Newtonian mechanics==
Momentum has a direction as well as magnitude. Quantities that have both a magnitude and a direction are known as [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities. Because momentum has a direction, it can be used to predict the resulting direction of objects after they collide, as well as their speeds. Below, the basic properties of momentum are described in one dimension. The vector equations are almost identical to the scalar equations (see [[Momentum#Multiple dimensions|multiple dimensions]]).

===Single particle===
The momentum of a particle is traditionally represented by the letter {{math|''p''}}. It is the product of two quantities, the [[mass]] (represented by the letter {{math|''m''}}) and [[velocity]] ({{math|''v''}}):&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh9&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p = m v. &lt;/math&gt;

The units of momentum are the product of the units of mass and velocity. In [[SI units]], if the mass is in kilograms and the velocity in meters per second then the momentum is in kilogram meters/second (kg&amp;nbsp;m/s). An equivalent [[SI derived unit|derived unit]] is the [[newton second]] (1&amp;nbsp;N&amp;nbsp;s = 1&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;m/s). In [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|cgs units]], if the mass is in grams and the velocity in centimeters per second then the momentum is in gram centimeters/second (g cm/s) or [[dyne]] seconds (1 dyne s = 1 g m/s).

Being a vector, momentum has magnitude and direction. For example, a 1&amp;nbsp;kg model airplane, traveling due north at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s in straight and level flight, has a momentum of 1&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;m/s due north measured from the ground.

===Many particles===
The momentum of a system of particles is the sum of their momenta. If two particles have masses {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and velocities {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the total momentum is
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} p &amp;= p_1 + p_2 \\
&amp;= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\,. \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
The momenta of more than two particles can be added in the same way.

A system of particles has a [[center of mass]], a point determined by the weighted sum of their positions:
:&lt;math&gt; r_\text{cm} = \frac{m_1 r_1 + m_2 r_2 + \cdots}{m_1 + m_2 + \cdots}.&lt;/math&gt;

If all the particles are moving, the center of mass will generally be moving as well (unless the system is in pure rotation around it). If the center of mass is moving at velocity {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the momentum is:
:&lt;math&gt;p= mv_\text{cm}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is known as [[Euler's laws of motion|Euler's first law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BookRags&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/eulers-laws-of-motion-wom/
|title=Euler's Laws of Motion

|publisher=PWS Publishing Company

|isbn=0-534-93399-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to force===

If a force {{math|''F''}} is applied to a particle for a time interval {{math|&amp;Delta;''t''}}, the momentum of the particle changes by an amount
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = F \Delta t\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In differential form, this is [[Newton's second law]]; the rate of change of the momentum of a particle is proportional to the force {{math|''F''}} acting on it,&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh9/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{dp }{d t}. &lt;/math&gt;

If the force depends on time, the change in momentum (or [[impulse (physics)|impulse]]) between times {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}  is
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta p = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} F(t)\, dt\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Under the assumption of constant mass {{math|''m''}}, it is equivalent to write
:&lt;math&gt;F = m\frac{dv}{d t} = m a,&lt;/math&gt;
so the force is equal to mass times [[acceleration]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh9/&gt;

''Example'': A model airplane of 1&amp;nbsp;kg accelerates from rest to a velocity of 6&amp;nbsp;m/s due north in 2&amp;nbsp;s. The net force required to produce this acceleration is 3&amp;nbsp;[[newton (unit)|newtons]] due north. The change in momentum is 6&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;m/s. The rate of change of momentum is 3&amp;nbsp;(kg&amp;thinsp;m/s)/s = 3&amp;nbsp;N.

===Conservation===
[[File:Newtons cradle animation book 2.gif|right|thumb|A [[Newton's cradle]] demonstrates conservation of momentum.]]
In a [[closed system]] (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces) the total momentum is constant. This fact, known as the ''law of conservation of momentum'', is implied by [[Newton's laws of motion]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh10&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose, for example, that two particles interact. Because of the third law, the forces between them are equal and opposite. If the particles are numbered 1 and 2, the second law states that {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''dt''}}}} and {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|''dt''}}}}. Therefore
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d p_1}{d t} = - \frac{d p_2}{d t}, &lt;/math&gt;
with the negative sign indicating that the forces oppose. Equivalently,
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{d t} \left(p_1+ p_2\right)= 0. &lt;/math&gt;

If the velocities of the particles are {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} before the interaction, and afterwards they are {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;m_1 u_{1} + m_2 u_{2} = m_1 v_{1} + m_2 v_{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This law holds no matter how complicated the force is between particles. Similarly, if there are several particles, the momentum exchanged between each pair of particles adds up to zero, so the total change in momentum is zero. This conservation law applies to all interactions, including [[collision]]s and separations caused by explosive forces.&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh10/&gt; It can also be generalized to situations where Newton's laws do not hold, for example in the [[theory of relativity]] and in [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]].&lt;ref name=Goldstein54/&gt;

===Dependence on reference frame===
[[File:Relativity an apple in a lift.svg|thumb|Newton's apple in Einstein's elevator. In person A's frame of reference, the apple has non-zero velocity and momentum. In the elevator's and person B's frames of reference, it has zero velocity and momentum.]]
Momentum is a measurable quantity, and the measurement depends on the motion of the observer. For example: if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a [[frame of reference]], in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior that is consistent with those same physical laws.

Suppose a particle has position {{math|''x''}} in a stationary frame of reference. From the point of view of another frame of reference, moving at a uniform speed {{math|''u''}}, the position (represented by a primed coordinate) changes with time as
:&lt;math&gt; x' = x - ut\,.&lt;/math&gt;
This is called a [[Galilean transformation]]. If the particle is moving at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''dx''|''dt''}} {{=}} ''v''}} in the first frame of reference, in the second, it is moving at speed
:&lt;math&gt; v' = \frac{dx'}{dt} = v-u\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Since {{math|''u''}} does not change, the accelerations are the same:
:&lt;math&gt; a' = \frac{dv'}{dt} = a\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, momentum is conserved in both reference frames. Moreover, as long as the force has the same form, in both frames, Newton's second law is unchanged. Forces such as Newtonian gravity, which depend only on the scalar distance between objects, satisfy this criterion. This independence of reference frame is called Newtonian relativity or [[Galilean invariance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A change of reference frame, can, often, simplify calculations of motion. For example, in a collision of two particles, a reference frame can be chosen, where, one particle begins at rest. Another, commonly used reference frame, is the [[center of mass frame]] - one that is moving with the center of mass. In this frame,
the total momentum is zero.

===Application to collisions===
By itself, the law of conservation of momentum is not enough to determine the motion of particles after a collision. Another property of the motion, [[kinetic energy]], must be known. This is not necessarily conserved. If it is conserved, the collision is called an ''[[elastic collision]]''; if not, it is an ''[[inelastic collision]]''.

====Elastic collisions====
{{Main|Elastic collision}}
[[File:Elastischer stoß.gif|thumb|right|Elastic collision of equal masses]]
[[File:Elastischer stoß3.gif|thumb|right|Elastic collision of unequal masses]]
An elastic collision is one in which no kinetic energy is lost. Perfectly elastic &quot;collisions&quot; can occur when the objects do not touch each other, as for example in atomic or nuclear scattering where electric repulsion keeps them apart. A [[gravity assist|slingshot maneuver]] of a satellite around a planet can also be viewed as a perfectly elastic collision from a distance. A collision between two [[Pool billiards|pool]] balls is a good example of an ''almost'' totally elastic collision, due to their high [[stiffness|rigidity]]; but when bodies come in contact there is always some [[dissipation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html |title=Elastic and inelastic collisions |work=Hyperphysics |author=Carl Nave |date=2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A head-on elastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities in one dimension, along a line passing through the bodies. If the velocities are {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} before the collision and {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} after, the equations expressing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 &amp;= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\
\tfrac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2 &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A change of reference frame can often simplify the analysis of a collision. For example, suppose there are two bodies of equal mass {{math|''m''}}, one stationary and one approaching the other at a speed {{math|''v''}} (as in the figure). The center of mass is moving at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|2}}}} and both bodies are moving towards it at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|2}}}}. Because of the symmetry, after the collision both must be moving away from the center of mass at the same speed. Adding the speed of the center of mass to both, we find that the body that was moving is now stopped and the other is moving away at speed {{math|''v''}}. The bodies have exchanged their velocities. Regardless of the velocities of the bodies, a switch to the center of mass frame leads us to the same conclusion. Therefore, the final velocities are given by&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh10/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}  v_1 &amp;= u_2\\
v_2 &amp;= u_1\,. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
 
In general, when the initial velocities are known, the final velocities are given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Serway|first=Raymond A.|author2=John W. Jewett, Jr|title=Principles of physics : a calculus-based text|date=2012|publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9781133104261|page=245|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_{1} = \left( \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right) u_{1} + \left( \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right) u_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_{2} = \left( \frac{m_2 - m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right) u_{2} + \left( \frac{2 m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right) u_{1}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
If one body has much greater mass than the other, its velocity will be little affected by a collision while the other body will experience a large change.

====Inelastic collisions====
{{Main|Inelastic collision}}

[[File:Inelastischer stoß.gif|thumb|right|a perfectly inelastic collision between equal masses]]
In an inelastic collision, some of the [[kinetic energy]] of the colliding bodies is converted into other forms of energy such as [[heat]] or [[sound]]. Examples include [[traffic collisions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/carcr.html#cc1 |title=Forces in car crashes |work=Hyperphysics |author=Carl Nave |date=2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the effect of lost kinetic energy can be seen in the damage to the vehicles; electrons losing some of their energy to atoms (as in the [[Franck–Hertz experiment]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/FrHz.html |title=The Franck-Hertz Experiment |work=Hyperphysics |author=Carl Nave |date=2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[particle accelerator]]s in which the kinetic energy is converted into mass in the form of new particles.

In a perfectly inelastic collision (such as a bug hitting a windshield), both bodies have the same motion afterwards. If one body is motionless to begin with, the equation for conservation of momentum is
:&lt;math&gt;m_1 u_1 = \left( m_1 + m_2 \right) v\,,&lt;/math&gt;
so
:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{m_1}{m_1+m_2} u_1\,.&lt;/math&gt;
In a frame of reference moving at the speed {{math|''v'')}}, the objects are brought to rest by the collision and 100% of the kinetic energy is converted.

One measure of the inelasticity of the collision is the [[coefficient of restitution]] {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;}}, defined as the ratio of relative velocity of separation to relative velocity of approach. In applying this measure to ball sports, this can be easily measured using the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGinnis|first=Peter M.|title=Biomechanics of sport and exercise|date=2005|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL [u.a.]|isbn=9780736051019|page=85|edition=2nd |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PrOKEcZXJ58C&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=coefficient+of+restitution+bounciness }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{R} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{bounce height}}{\text{drop height}}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The momentum and energy equations also apply to the motions of objects that begin together and then move apart. For example, an [[explosion]] is the result of a chain reaction that transforms potential energy stored in chemical, mechanical, or nuclear form into kinetic energy, acoustic energy, and electromagnetic radiation. [[Rocket]]s also make use of conservation of momentum: propellant is thrust outward,  gaining momentum, and an equal and opposite momentum is imparted to the rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = George | title = Rocket Propulsion Elements |edition=7th |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LQbDOxg3XZcC&amp;printsec=frontcover | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester | date = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-471-32642-7 |chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple dimensions===
[[File:Elastischer stoß 2D.gif|thumb|right|Two-dimensional elastic collision. There is no motion perpendicular to the image, so only two components are needed to represent the velocities and momenta. The two blue vectors represent velocities after the collision and add vectorially to get the initial (red) velocity.]]
Real motion has both direction and velocity and must be represented by a [[Vector (geometry)|vector]]. In a coordinate system with {{math|''x, y, z''}} axes, velocity has components {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the {{math|''x''}} direction, {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the {{math|''y''}} direction, {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the {{math|''z''}} direction. The vector is represented by a boldface symbol:&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh11&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \left(v_x,v_y,v_z \right). &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the momentum is a vector quantity and is represented by a boldface symbol:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \left(p_x,p_y,p_z \right). &lt;/math&gt;

The equations in the previous sections, work in vector form if the scalars {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''v''}} are replaced by vectors {{math|'''p'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}. Each vector equation represents three scalar equations. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}= m \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;
represents three equations:&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh11/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} p_x &amp;= m v_x\\ p_y &amp;= m v_y \\ p_z &amp;= m v_z. \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The kinetic energy equations are exceptions to the above replacement rule. The equations are still one-dimensional, but each scalar represents the [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vectors|magnitude of the vector]], for example,
:&lt;math&gt; v^2 = v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Each vector equation represents three scalar equations. Often coordinates can be chosen so that only two components are needed, as in the figure. Each component can be obtained separately and the results combined to produce a vector result.&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh11/&gt;

A simple construction involving the center of mass frame can be used to show that if a stationary elastic sphere is struck by a moving sphere, the two will head off at right angles after the collision (as in the figure).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|pp=26&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objects of variable mass ===

The concept of momentum plays a fundamental role in explaining the behavior of [[variable-mass system|variable-mass objects]] such as a [[rocket]] ejecting fuel or a [[star]] [[accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] gas. In analyzing such an object, one treats the object's mass as a function that varies with time: {{math|''m''(''t'')}}. The momentum of the object at time {{math|''t''}} is therefore {{math|''p''(''t'') {{=}} ''m''(''t'')''v''(''t'')}}. One might then try to invoke Newton's second law of motion by saying that the external force {{math|''F''}} on the object is related to its momentum {{math|''p''(''t'')}} by {{math|''F'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''|''dt''}}}}, but this is incorrect, as is the related expression found by applying the product rule to {{math|{{sfrac|''d''(''mv'')|''dt''}}}}:&lt;ref name=&quot;kleppner135&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|last2=Kolenkow|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|page=135&amp;ndash;39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F = m(t) \frac{dv}{dt} + v(t) \frac{dm}{dt}. \qquad \mathrm{}&lt;/math&gt; (incorrect)
This equation does not correctly describe the motion of variable-mass objects. The correct equation is
:&lt;math&gt; F = m(t) \frac{dv}{dt} - u \frac{dm}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''u''}} is the velocity of the ejected/accreted mass ''as seen in the object's rest frame''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kleppner135&quot; /&gt; This is distinct from {{math|''v''}}, which is the velocity of the object itself as seen in an inertial frame.

This equation is derived by keeping track of both the momentum of the object as well as the momentum of the ejected/accreted mass. When considered together, the object and the mass constitute a closed system in which total momentum is conserved.

==Relativistic mechanics==
{{See also|Mass in special relativity|Tests of relativistic energy and momentum}}

===Lorentz invariance===
Newtonian physics assumes that [[absolute time and space]] exist outside of any observer; this gives rise to the [[Galilean invariance]] described earlier. It also results in a prediction that the [[speed of light]] can vary from one reference frame to another. This is contrary to observation. In the [[special theory of relativity]], Einstein keeps the postulate that the equations of motion do not depend on the reference frame, but assumes that the speed of light {{math|''c''}} is invariant. As a result, position and time in two reference frames are related by the [[Lorentz transformation]] instead of the [[Galilean transformation]].&lt;ref name=RindlerCh2&gt;{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider, for example, a reference frame moving relative to another at velocity {{math|''v''}} in the {{math|''x''}} direction. The Galilean transformation gives the coordinates of the moving frame as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
t' &amp;= t  \\ 
x' &amp;= x - v t
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
while the Lorentz transformation gives&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh15&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 15-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
t' &amp;= \gamma \left( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right)  \\ 
x' &amp;= \gamma \left( x - v t \right)\, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''γ''}} is the [[Lorentz factor]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Newton's second law, with mass fixed, is not invariant under a Lorentz transformation. However, it can be made invariant by making the ''inertial mass'' {{math|''m''}} of an object a function of velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;m = \gamma m_0\,;&lt;/math&gt;
{{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the object's [[invariant mass]].&lt;ref name=Rindler&gt;{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|pp=77&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modified momentum,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = \gamma m_0 \mathbf{v}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
obeys Newton's second law:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{d \mathbf{p}}{dt}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Within the domain of classical mechanics, relativistic momentum closely approximates Newtonian momentum: at low velocity, {{math|''γm''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''v'''}} is approximately equal to {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''v'''}}, the Newtonian expression for momentum.

===Four-vector formulation===
{{Main|Four-momentum}}
In the theory of special relativity, physical quantities are expressed in terms of [[four-vector]]s that include time as a fourth coordinate along with the three space coordinates. These vectors are generally represented by capital letters, for example {{math|'''R'''}} for position. The expression for the ''four-momentum'' depends on how the coordinates are expressed. Time may be given in its normal units or multiplied by the speed of light so that all the components of the four-vector have dimensions of length. If the latter scaling is used, an interval of [[proper time]], {{math|''&amp;tau;''}}, defined by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c^2d\tau^2 = c^2dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2\,,&lt;/math&gt;
is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under Lorentz transformations (in this expression and in what follows the {{nowrap|(+ − − −)}} [[metric signature]] has been used, different authors use different conventions). Mathematically this invariance can be ensured in one of two ways: by treating the four-vectors as [[Euclidean vector]]s and multiplying time by [[Imaginary unit|{{math|{{sqrt|−1}}}}]]; or by keeping time a real quantity and embedding the vectors in a [[Minkowski space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Misner|first=Charles W.|author2=Kip S. Thorne |author3=John Archibald Wheeler  |title=Gravitation|date=1973|publisher=W. H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9780716703440|page=51|others=24th printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Minkowski space, the [[scalar product]] of two four-vectors {{math|'''U''' {{=}} (''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|'''V''' {{=}} (''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''V''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{U} \cdot \mathbf{V} =  U_0 V_0 - U_1 V_1 - U_2 V_2 - U_3 V_3\,. &lt;/math&gt;

In all the coordinate systems, the ([[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]]) relativistic four-velocity is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{U} \equiv \frac{d \mathbf{R}}{d \tau} = \gamma \frac{d \mathbf{R}}{dt}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and the (contravariant) [[four-momentum]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = m_0\mathbf{U}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the invariant mass. If {{math|'''R''' {{=}} (''ct,x,y,z'')}} (in Minkowski space), then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \gamma m_0 \left(c,\mathbf{v}\right) = (m c,\mathbf{p})\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Using Einstein's [[mass-energy equivalence]], {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, this can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \mathbf{p}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, conservation of four-momentum is Lorentz-invariant and implies conservation of both mass and energy.

The magnitude of the momentum four-vector is equal to {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;||\mathbf{P}||^2 = \mathbf{P}\cdot\mathbf{P} = \gamma^2m_0^2(c^2-v^2) = (m_0c)^2\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and is invariant across all reference frames.

The relativistic energy–momentum relationship holds even for massless particles such as photons; by setting {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;E = pc\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In a game of relativistic &quot;billiards&quot;, if a stationary particle is hit by a moving particle in an elastic collision, the paths formed by the two afterwards will form an acute angle. This is unlike the non-relativistic case where they travel at right angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|pp=86&amp;ndash;87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalized coordinates==
{{See also|Analytical mechanics}}
Newton's laws can be difficult to apply to many kinds of motion because the motion is limited by ''constraints''. For example, a bead on an abacus is constrained to move along its wire and a pendulum bob is constrained to swing at a fixed distance from the pivot. Many such constraints can be incorporated by changing the normal [[Cartesian coordinates]] to a set of ''[[generalized coordinates]]'' that may be fewer in number.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=11&amp;ndash;13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refined mathematical methods have been developed for solving mechanics problems in generalized coordinates. They introduce a ''generalized momentum'', also known as the ''canonical'' or ''conjugate momentum'', that extends the concepts of both linear momentum and [[angular momentum]]. To distinguish it from generalized momentum, the product of mass and velocity is also referred to as ''mechanical'', ''kinetic'' or ''kinematic momentum''.&lt;ref name=Goldstein54&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=54&amp;ndash;56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1975|p=574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FeynmanQM&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 3|loc=Chapter 21-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main methods are described below.

===Lagrangian mechanics===
In [[Lagrangian mechanics]], a Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the [[kinetic energy]] {{math|''T''}} and the [[potential energy]] {{math|''V''}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}  = T-V\,.&lt;/math&gt;
If the generalized coordinates are represented as a vector {{math|'''q''' {{=}} (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) }} and time differentiation is represented by a dot over the variable, then the equations of motion (known as the Lagrange or [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s) are a set of {{math|''N''}} equations:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=20&amp;ndash;21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{d t}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L} }{\partial\dot{q}_j}\right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q_j} = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;
If a coordinate {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is not a Cartesian coordinate, the associated generalized momentum component {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not necessarily have the dimensions of linear momentum. Even if {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a Cartesian coordinate, {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} will not be the same as the mechanical momentum if the potential depends on velocity.&lt;ref name=Goldstein54/&gt;  Some sources represent the kinematic momentum by the symbol {{math|'''&amp;Pi;'''}}.&lt;ref name=Lerner&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Lerner|editor-first=Rita G.|title=Encyclopedia of physics|date=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH-Verl.|location=Weinheim|isbn=978-3527405541|edition=3rd  |editor2-last=Trigg |editor2-first=George L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this mathematical framework, a generalized momentum is associated with the generalized coordinates. Its components are defined as
:&lt;math&gt; p_j = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L} }{\partial \dot{q}_j}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Each component {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is said to be the ''conjugate momentum'' for the coordinate {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Now if a given coordinate {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not appear in the Lagrangian (although its time derivative might appear), then
:&lt;math&gt; p_j = \text{constant}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the generalization of the conservation of momentum.&lt;ref name=Goldstein54/&gt;

Even if the generalized coordinates are just the ordinary spatial coordinates, the conjugate momenta are not necessarily the ordinary momentum coordinates. An example is found in the section on electromagnetism.

===Hamiltonian mechanics===
In [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], the Lagrangian (a function of generalized coordinates and their derivatives) is replaced by a Hamiltonian that is a function of generalized coordinates and momentum. The Hamiltonian is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H}\left(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p},t\right) = \mathbf{p}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{q}} - \mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},t\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the momentum is obtained by differentiating the Lagrangian as above. The Hamiltonian equations of motion are&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=341&amp;ndash;342}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\dot{q}_i &amp;= \frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial p_i}\\
-\dot{p}_i &amp;= \frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial q_i}\\
-\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial t} &amp;= \frac{d \mathcal{H}}{d t}\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
As in Lagrangian mechanics, if a generalized coordinate does not appear in the Hamiltonian, its conjugate momentum component is conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetry and conservation===
Conservation of momentum is a mathematical consequence of the [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] (shift [[symmetry]]) of space (position in space is the [[canonical conjugate]] quantity to momentum). That is, conservation of momentum is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not depend on position; this is a special case of [[Noether's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hand|first1=Louis N. |last2=Finch |first2=Janet D. |title=Analytical mechanics|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=9780521575720|edition=7th print |pages=Chapter 4 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electromagnetism==
In Newtonian mechanics, the law of conservation of momentum can be derived from the [[law of action and reaction]], which states that every force has a reciprocating equal and opposite force. Under some circumstances, moving charged particles can exert forces on each other in non-opposite directions.&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffiths|first1=David J.|title=Introduction to electrodynamics|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=978-0321856562|edition=Fourth|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Maxwell's equations]], the foundation of classical electrodynamics, are Lorentz-invariant. Nevertheless, the combined momentum of the particles and the electromagnetic field is conserved.

===Vacuum===
In Maxwell's equations, the forces between particles are mediated by electric and magnetic fields. The electromagnetic force (''[[Lorentz force]]'') on a particle with charge {{math|''q''}} due to a combination of [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} and [[magnetic field]] (as given by the &quot;B-field&quot; {{math|'''B'''}}) is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}).&lt;/math&gt;
This force imparts a momentum to the particle, so by Newton's second law the particle must impart a momentum to the electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson238&quot; /&gt;

In a vacuum, the momentum per unit volume is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g} = \frac{1}{\mu_0 c^2}\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[vacuum permeability]] and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. The momentum density is proportional to the [[Poynting vector]] {{math|'''S'''}} which gives the directional rate of energy transfer per unit area:&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson238&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh27&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 27-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g} = \frac{\mathbf{S}}{c^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If momentum is to be conserved in a volume {{math|''V''}}, changes in the momentum of matter through the Lorentz force must be balanced by changes in the momentum of the electromagnetic field and outflow of momentum. If {{math|'''P'''&lt;sub&gt;mech&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the momentum of all the particles in a volume {{math|''V''}}, and the particles are treated as a continuum, then Newton's second law gives
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d \mathbf{P}_\text{mech}}{d t} = \int_V \left(\rho\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{J}\times\mathbf{B}\right) dV\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The electromagnetic momentum is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P}_\text{field} = \frac{1}{\mu_0c^2} \int_V \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B} dV\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and the equation for conservation of each component {{math|''i''}} of the momentum is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{d t}\left(\mathbf{P}_\text{mech}+ \mathbf{P}_\text{field} \right)_i = \oint_S \sum_j T_{ij} n_j dS\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The term on the right is an integral over the surface {{math|''S''}} representing momentum flow into and out of the volume, and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a component of the surface normal of {{math|''S''}}. The quantity {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is called the [[Maxwell stress tensor]], defined as
:&lt;math&gt;T_{i j} \equiv \epsilon_0 \left(E_i E_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} E^2\right) + \frac{1}{\mu_0}  \left(B_i B_j - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ij} B^2\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson238&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1975|pp=238&amp;ndash;241}} Expressions, given in [[Gaussian units]] in the text, were converted to SI units using Table 3 in the Appendix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
The above results are for the ''microscopic'' Maxwell equations, applicable to electromagnetic forces in a vacuum (or on a very small scale in media). It is more difficult to define momentum density in media because the division into electromagnetic and mechanical is arbitrary. The definition of electromagnetic momentum density is modified to
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g} = \frac{1}{c^2}\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{H} = \frac{\mathbf{S}}{c^2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the H-field {{math|'''H'''}} is related to the B-field and the [[magnetization]] {{math|'''M'''}} by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \left(\mathbf{H} + \mathbf{M}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The electromagnetic stress tensor depends on the properties of the media.&lt;ref name=Jackson238/&gt;

===Particle in field===

If a charged particle {{math|''q''}} moves in an electromagnetic field, neither its kinetic momentum {{math|''m'''''v'''}} nor its canonical momentum is conserved.

====Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation====&lt;!--this section links to [[Lorentz force#Lorentz force and analytical mechanics]]--&gt;

The ''kinetic momentum'' {{math|'''p'''}} is different from the ''[[canonical momentum]]'' {{math|'''P'''}} (synonymous with the [[generalized momentum]]) conjugate to the ordinary position coordinates {{math|'''r'''}}, because {{math|'''P'''}} includes a contribution from the [[electric potential]] {{math|''φ''('''r''', ''t'')}} and [[vector potential]] {{math|'''A'''('''r''', ''t'')}}:&lt;ref name=Lerner /&gt;

where {{math|1='''ṙ''' = '''v'''}} is the velocity (see [[time derivative]]), {{math|''q''}} is the [[electric charge]] of the particle and {{math|1=''γ'' = (1 − {{sfrac|'''ṙ'''·'''ṙ'''|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}})&lt;sup&gt;−{{1/2}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the Lorentz factor. See also [[momentum#Electromagnetism|Electromagnetism (momentum)]]. If neither {{math|''φ''}} nor {{math|'''A'''}} depends on position, {{math|'''P'''}} is conserved.&lt;ref name=Goldstein54/&gt;

The classical [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] {{math|ℋ}} for a particle in any field equals the total energy of the system – the [[kinetic energy]] {{math|1=''T'' = {{sfrac|'''p'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2''m''}}}} (where {{math|1='''p'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = '''p''' · '''p'''}}, see [[dot product]]) plus the [[potential energy]] {{math|''V''}}. For a particle in an [[electromagnetic field]], the potential energy is {{math|1=''V'' = ''eφ''}}, and since the kinetic energy {{math|''T''}} always corresponds to the kinetic momentum {{math|'''p'''}}, replacing the kinetic momentum by the above equation ({{math|1='''p''' = '''P''' − ''q'''''A'''}}) leads to the Hamiltonian in the table.

These Lagrangian and Hamiltonian expressions can derive the [[Lorentz force#Lorentz force and analytical mechanics|Lorentz force]].

====Canonical commutation relations====

The kinetic momentum ({{math|'''p'''}} above) satisfies the [[Commutator|commutation relation]]:&lt;ref name=Lerner/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left [ p_j , p_k \right ] = \frac{i\hbar e}{c} \varepsilon_{jkl} B_l&lt;/math&gt;

where: {{math|''j''}}, {{math|''k''}}, {{math|''l''}} are indices labelling vector components, {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a component of the [[magnetic field]], and {{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;kjl&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], here in 3 dimensions.

==Quantum mechanics==
{{further2|[[Momentum operator]]}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], momentum is defined as an [[operator (physics)|operator]] on the [[wave function]]. The [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[uncertainty principle]] defines limits on how accurately the momentum and position of a single observable system can be known at once. In quantum mechanics, position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]].

For a single particle described in the position basis the momentum operator can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}={\hbar\over i}\nabla=-i\hbar\nabla\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∇}} is the [[gradient]] operator, {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]]. This is a commonly encountered form of the momentum operator, though the momentum operator in other bases can take other forms. For example, in [[momentum space]] the momentum operator is represented as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}\psi(p) = p\psi(p)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the operator {{math|'''p'''}} acting on a wave function {{math|''ψ''(''p'')}} yields that wave function multiplied by the value {{math|''p''}}, in an analogous fashion to the way that the position operator acting on a wave function {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}} yields that wave function multiplied by the value ''x''.

For both massive and massless objects, relativistic momentum is related to the [[Matter wave|de Broglie wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}} by
:&lt;math&gt; p = h/\lambda.\,&lt;/math&gt;
[[Electromagnetic radiation]] (including [[light|visible light]], [[ultraviolet]] light, and [[radio waves]]) is carried by [[photons]]. Even though photons (the particle aspect of light) have no mass, they still carry momentum. This leads to applications such as the [[solar sail]]. The calculation of the momentum of light within [[dielectric]] media is somewhat controversial (see [[Abraham–Minkowski controversy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnett|first=Stephen M.|title=Resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski Dilemma|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=2010|volume=104|issue=7|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.070401|bibcode = 2010PhRvL.104g0401B|pmid=20366861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deformable bodies and fluids==

===Conservation in a continuum===
{{Main|Cauchy momentum equation}}
[[File:Equation motion body.svg|right|thumb|Motion of a material body]]
In fields such as [[fluid dynamics]] and [[solid mechanics]], it is not feasible to follow the motion of individual atoms or molecules. Instead, the materials must be approximated by a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] in which there is a particle or [[fluid parcel]] at each point that is assigned the average of the properties of atoms in a small region nearby. In particular, it has a density {{math|''&amp;rho;''}} and velocity {{math|'''v'''}} that depend on time {{math|''t''}} and position {{math|'''r'''}}. The momentum per unit volume is {{math|''&amp;rho;'''''v'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tritton|2006|pages=48&amp;ndash;51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a column of water in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. All the forces on the water are in balance and the water is motionless. On any given drop of water, two forces are balanced. The first is gravity, which acts directly on each atom and molecule inside. The gravitational force per unit volume is {{math|''&amp;rho;'''''g'''}}, where {{math|'''g'''}} is the [[gravitational acceleration]]. The second force is the sum of all the forces exerted on its surface by the surrounding water. The force from below is greater than the force from above by just the amount needed to balance gravity. The normal force per unit area is the [[pressure]] {{math|''p''}}. The average force per unit volume inside the droplet is the gradient of the pressure, so the force balance equation is&lt;ref name=FeynmanCh40&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 2|loc=Chapter 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-\nabla p +\rho \mathbf{g} = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the forces are not balanced, the droplet accelerates. This acceleration is not simply the partial derivative {{math|{{sfrac|''&amp;part;'''''v'''|''&amp;part;t''}}}} because the fluid in a given volume changes with time. Instead, the [[material derivative]] is needed:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tritton|2006|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{Dt} \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial t}  + \mathbf{v}\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Applied to any physical quantity, the material derivative includes the rate of change at a point and the changes due to [[advection]] as fluid is carried past the point. Per unit volume, the rate of change in momentum is equal to {{math|''&amp;rho;''{{sfrac|''D'''''v'''|''Dt''}}}}. This is equal to the net force on the droplet.

Forces that can change the momentum of a droplet include the gradient of the pressure and gravity, as above. In addition, surface forces can deform the droplet. In the simplest case, a [[shear stress]] {{math|''&amp;tau;''}}, exerted by a force parallel to the surface of the droplet, is proportional to the rate of deformation or [[strain rate]]. Such a shear stress occurs if the fluid has a velocity gradient because the fluid is moving faster on one side than another. If the speed in the {{math|''x''}} direction varies with {{math|''z''}}, the  tangential force in direction {{math|''x''}} per unit area normal to the {{math|''z''}} direction is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\text{zx} = -\mu\frac{\partial v_\text{x}}{\partial z}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''&amp;mu;''}} is the [[viscosity]]. This is also a [[flux]], or flow per unit area, of x-momentum through the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=R. Byron|author2=Warren Stewart |author3=Edwin N. Lightfoot  |title=Transport phenomena|date=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780470115398|page=13|edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including the effect of viscosity, the momentum balance equations for the [[incompressible flow]] of a [[Newtonian fluid]] are
:&lt;math&gt;\rho \frac{D \mathbf{v}}{D t} = -\boldsymbol{\nabla} p + \mu\nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho\mathbf{g}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
These are known as the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tritton|2006|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The momentum balance equations can be extended to more general materials, including solids. For each surface with normal in direction {{math|''i''}} and force in direction {{math|''j''}}, there is a stress component {{math|''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The nine components make up the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] {{math|'''&amp;sigma;'''}}, which includes both pressure and shear. The local conservation of momentum is expressed by the [[Cauchy momentum equation]]:

The Cauchy momentum equation is broadly applicable to [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformations]] of solids and liquids. The relationship between the stresses and the strain rate depends on the properties of the material (see [[Viscosity#Types of viscosity|Types of viscosity]]).

===Acoustic waves===

A disturbance in a medium gives rise to oscillations, or [[wave]]s, that propagate away from their source. In a fluid, small changes in pressure {{math|''p''}} can often be described by the [[acoustic wave equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 p\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of sound]]. In a solid, similar equations can be obtained for propagation of pressure ([[P-wave]]s) and shear ([[S-waves]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gubbins|first=David|title=Seismology and plate tectonics|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=0521379954|page=59|edition=Repr.

==History of the concept==
{{see also|Theory of impetus}}
In about 530 A.D., working in Alexandria, Byzantine philosopher [[John Philoponus]] developed a concept of momentum in his commentary to [[Aristotle]]'s ''Physics''.
Aristotle claimed that everything that is moving must be kept moving by something. For example, a thrown ball must be kept moving by motions of the air.  Most writers continued to accept Aristotle's theory until the time of Galileo, but a few were skeptical. Philoponus pointed out the absurdity in Aristotle's claim that motion of an object is promoted by the same air that is resisting its passage. He proposed instead that an impetus was imparted to the object in the act of throwing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.1 |encyclopedia=Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=John Philoponus |date=8 June 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Sīnā (also known by his Latinized name [[Avicenna]]) read Philoponus and published his own theory of motion in ''The Book of Healing'' in 1020. He agreed that an impetus is imparted to a projectile by the thrower; but unlike Philoponus, who believed that it was a temporary virtue that would decline even in a vacuum, he viewed it as a persistent, requiring external forces such as [[air resistance]] to dissipate it.&lt;ref name=Espinoza&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Espinoza | first1 = Fernando  | date = 2005 | title = An analysis of the historical development of ideas about motion and its implications for teaching | url = | journal = Physics Education | volume = 40 | issue = 2| page = 141 | doi=10.1088/0031-9120/40/2/002|bibcode = 2005PhyEd..40..139E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nasr&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia |author=[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] &amp; Mehdi Amin Razavi |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=1996 |isbn=0-7007-0314-4 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayili&gt;{{cite journal

The work of Philoponus, and possibly that of Ibn Sīnā,&lt;ref name=Sayili/&gt; was read and refined by the European philosophers [[Peter Olivi]] and [[Jean Buridan]]. Buridan, who in about 1350 was made rector of the University of Paris, referred to [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] being proportional to the weight times the speed. Moreover, Buridan's theory was different from his predecessor's in that he did not consider impetus to be self-dissipating, asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Medieval Science, Technology and Medicine:an Encyclopedia |page=107 |title=Buridian, John |author=T.F.

[[René Descartes]] believed that the total &quot;quantity of motion&quot; in the universe is conserved, where the quantity of motion is understood as the product of size and speed. This should not be read as a statement of the modern law of momentum, since he had no concept of mass as distinct from weight and size, and more importantly he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved. So for Descartes if a moving object were to bounce off a surface, changing its direction but not its speed, there would be no change in its quantity of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Leibniz]], in his &quot;[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]&quot;, gave an argument against Descartes' construction of the conservation of the &quot;quantity of motion&quot; using an example of dropping blocks of different sizes different distances.

The first correct statement of the law of conservation of momentum was by English mathematician [[John Wallis]] in his 1670 work, ''Mechanica sive De Motu, Tractatus Geometricus'': &quot;the initial state of the body, either of rest or of motion, will persist&quot; and &quot;If the force is greater than the resistance, motion will result&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.F. |last=Scott |title=The Mathematical Work of John Wallis, D.D., F.R.S. |publisher=Chelsea Publishing Company |date=1981 |isbn=0-8284-0314-7 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis uses ''momentum'' and ''vis'' for force. Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', when it was first published in 1687, showed a similar casting around for words to use for the mathematical momentum. His Definition II defines ''quantitas motus'', &quot;quantity of motion&quot;, as &quot;arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly&quot;, which identifies it as momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Grimsehl |others=Translated by Leonard Ary Woodward |title=A Textbook of Physics |publisher=Blackie &amp; Son limited |date=1932 |location=London, Glasgow |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus when in Law II he refers to ''mutatio motus'', &quot;change of motion&quot;, being proportional to the force impressed, he is generally taken to mean momentum and not motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aldo |last=Rescigno |title=Foundation of Pharmacokinetics |date=2003 |isbn=0306477041 |location=New York |publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained only to assign a standard term to the quantity of motion. The first use of &quot;momentum&quot; in its proper mathematical sense is not clear but by the time of Jenning's ''Miscellanea'' in 1721, four years before the final edition of Newton's ''Principia Mathematica'', momentum {{math|M}} or &quot;quantity of motion&quot; was being defined for students as &quot;a rectangle&quot;, the product of {{math|Q}} and {{math|V}}, where {{math|Q}} is &quot;quantity of material&quot; and {{math|V}} is &quot;velocity&quot;, {{math|{{sfrac|''s''|''t''}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Jennings |authorlink=John Jennings (tutor) |title=Miscellanea in Usum Juventutis Academicae |publisher=R.

In [[photometry (optics)|photometry]], '''luminous energy''' is the perceived [[energy]] of [[light]]. This is sometimes called the '''quantity of light'''. Luminous energy is not the same as [[radiant energy]], the corresponding objective [[physical quantity]]. This is because the [[human eye]] can only see light in the [[visible spectrum]] and has different sensitivities to [[light]] of different [[wavelength]]s within the spectrum. When adapted for bright conditions ([[photopic vision]]), the eye is most sensitive to light at a wavelength of 555&amp;nbsp;[[metre|nm]]. Light with a given amount of radiant energy will have more luminous energy if the wavelength is 555&amp;nbsp;nm than if the wavelength is longer or shorter. Light whose wavelength is well outside the [[visible spectrum]] has a luminous energy of zero, regardless of the amount of radiant energy present.

The [[SI]] unit of luminous energy is the [[lumen second]], which is unofficially known as the [[Talbot (unit)|talbot]] in honor of [[William Henry Fox Talbot]]. In other [[systems of units]], luminous energy may be expressed in basic units of energy.

Starting at the origin, the upward curve is the ''initial magnetization curve''. The downward curve after saturation, along with the lower return curve, form the ''main loop''. The intercepts {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the ''[[coercivity]]'' and ''[[remanence#Saturation remanence|saturation remanence]]''. ]]

When an external [[magnetic field]] is applied to a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]] such as [[iron]], the atomic [[dipole]]s align themselves with it. Even when the field is removed, part of the alignment will be retained: the material has become ''magnetized''. Once magnetized, the magnet will stay magnetized indefinitely. To [[Magnet#Demagnetizing ferromagnets|demagnetize]] it requires heat or a magnetic field in the opposite direction. This is the effect that provides the element of memory in a [[hard disk drive]].

The relationship between field strength {{math|&lt;var&gt;H&lt;/var&gt;}} and magnetization {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}}  is not linear in such materials. If a magnet is demagnetized ({{math|&lt;var&gt;H{{=}}M{{=}}0&lt;/var&gt;}}) and the relationship between {{math|&lt;var&gt;H&lt;/var&gt;}} and  {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}}  is plotted for increasing levels of field strength,  {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}} follows the ''initial magnetization curve''. This curve increases rapidly at first and then approaches an [[asymptote]] called [[Saturation (magnetic)|magnetic saturation]]. If the magnetic field is now reduced monotonically, {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}} follows a different curve.  At zero field strength, the magnetization is offset from the origin by an amount called the [[remanence]]. If the {{math|&lt;var&gt;H-M&lt;/var&gt;}} relationship is plotted for all strengths of applied magnetic field the result is a hysteresis loop called the ''main loop''. The width of the middle section is twice the [[coercivity]] of the material.&lt;ref name=Chikazumi1997ch1&gt;{{harvnb|Chikazumi|1997|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A closer look at a magnetization curve generally reveals a series of small, random jumps in magnetization called [[Barkhausen effect|Barkhausen jumps]]. This effect is due to [[crystallographic defect]]s such as [[dislocation]]s.&lt;ref name=Chikazumi1997ch15&gt;{{harvnb|Chikazumi|1997|loc=Chapter 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic hysteresis loops are not exclusive to materials with ferromagnetic ordering. Other magnetic orderings, such as [[spin glass]] ordering, also exhibit this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monod |first1=P. |last2=Prejean |first2=J.

==Physical origin==

{{Main|Ferromagnetism}}
The phenomenon of hysteresis in [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials is the result of two effects: rotation of [[magnetization]] and changes in size or number of [[magnetic domain]]s. In general, the magnetization varies (in direction but not magnitude) across a magnet, but in sufficiently small magnets, it does not. In these [[Single domain (magnetic)|single-domain]] magnets, the magnetization responds to a magnetic field by rotating. Single-domain magnets are used wherever a strong, stable magnetization is needed (for example, [[magnetic recording]]).

Larger magnets are divided into regions called ''domains''. Within each domain, the magnetization does not vary; but between domains are relatively thin ''domain walls'' in which the direction of magnetization rotates from the direction of one domain to another. If the magnetic field changes, the walls move, changing the relative sizes of the domains. Because the domains are not magnetized in the same direction, the [[magnetic moment]] per unit volume is smaller than it would be in a single-domain magnet; but domain walls involve rotation of only a small part of the magnetization, so it is much easier to change the magnetic moment. The magnetization can also change by addition or subtraction of domains (called ''nucleation'' and ''denucleation'').

==Models==
The most known empirical models in hysteresis are [[Preisach model of hysteresis|Preisach]] and [[Jiles-Atherton model]]s. These models allow an accurate modeling of the hysteresis loop and are widely used in the industry. However, these models lose the connection with thermodynamics and the energy consistency is not ensured. Latest models rely on a consistent thermodynamic formulation. VINCH model&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Francois-Lavet et al (2011-11-14). [http://vincent.francois-l.be/VINCH_model.pdf Vectorial Incremental Nonconservative Consistent Hysteresis model].&lt;/ref&gt; is inspired by the [[Work hardening|kinematic hardening]] laws and by the [[thermodynamics]] of [[irreversible process]]es. In particular, in addition to provide an accurate modeling, the stored magnetic energy and the dissipated energy are known at all times. The obtained incremental formulation is variationally consistent, i.e., all internal variables follow from the minimization of a thermodynamic potential. That allows to obtain easily a vectorial model while Preisach and Jiles-Atherton are fundamentally scalar models.

==Applications==
{{Main|Magnet#Common uses}}

There are a great variety of applications of the hysteresis in ferromagnets. Many of these make use of their ability to retain a memory, for example [[magnetic tape]], [[hard disks]], and [[credit card]]s. In these applications, ''hard'' magnets (high coercivity) like [[iron]] are desirable so the memory is not easily erased.

''Soft'' magnets (low coercivity) are used as cores in [[electromagnet]]s. The nonlinear response of the magnetic moment to a magnetic field boosts the response of the coil wrapped around it. The low coercivity reduces that energy loss associated with hysteresis.

Arrows indicate redshift. Wavelength increases up towards the red and beyond (frequency decreases).]]

In [[physics]], '''redshift''' happens when light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]] from an object is increased in [[wavelength]], or shifted to the red end of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]]. In general, whether or not the radiation is within the [[visible spectrum]], &quot;redder&quot; means an increase in [[wavelength]] – equivalent to a lower [[frequency]] and a lower [[photon]] energy, in accordance with, respectively, the [[Wave theory of light|wave]] and [[Light#Quantum theory|quantum]] theories of light.

Some redshifts are an example of the [[Doppler effect]], familiar in the change of apparent [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] of sirens and [[frequency]] of the [[sound|sound waves]] emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. Another kind of redshift is [[Cosmology|cosmological]] redshift, which is due to the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]], and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million [[Light-year|light years]] away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, [[gravitational redshift]] is a [[general relativity|relativistic]] effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of [[gravitational field]]s. Conversely, a ''decrease'' in wavelength is called [[blueshift]] and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.

Knowledge of redshifts and blueshifts has been applied to develop several terrestrial technologies such as [[Doppler radar]] and [[radar gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Feynman, Leighton and Sands (1989) or any introductory undergraduate (and many high school) [[Physics/Further reading|physics textbooks]]. See Taylor (1992) for a relativistic discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Redshifts are also seen in the [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] observations of [[Astronomy|astronomical]] objects.&lt;ref name=basicastronomy&gt;See Binney and Merrifeld (1998), Carroll and Ostlie (1996), Kutner (2003) for applications in astronomy.&lt;/ref&gt; Its value is represented by the letter ''z.''

A [[special relativity|special relativistic]] [[#Redshift formulae|redshift formula]] (and its [[classical physics|classical approximation]]) can be used to calculate the redshift of a nearby object when [[spacetime]] is [[Minkowski space|flat]]. However, in many contexts, such as [[black hole]]s and [[Big Bang cosmology]], redshifts must be calculated using [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;See Misner, Thorne and Wheeler (1973) and Weinberg (1971) or any of the [[physical cosmology#Textbooks|physical cosmology textbooks]]&lt;/ref&gt; Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of [[Frame of reference|frame transformation laws]]. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including [[scattering]] and [[physical optics|optical effects]]; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on [[#Effects due to physical optics or radiative transfer|physical optics and radiative transfer]]).

==History==
The history of the subject began with the development in the 19th century of [[wave|wave mechanics]] and the exploration of phenomena associated with the [[Doppler effect]]. The effect is named after [[Christian Doppler]], who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this was verified, however, it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star's [[color temperature|temperature]], not motion. Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations.

The first Doppler redshift was described by French physicist [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] in 1848, who pointed to the shift in [[spectral line]]s seen in stars as being due to the Doppler effect. The effect is sometimes called the &quot;Doppler–Fizeau effect&quot;. In 1868, British astronomer [[William Huggins]] was the first to determine the velocity of a star moving away from the Earth by this method.&lt;ref name=Huggins&gt;

Beginning with observations in 1912, [[Vesto Slipher]] discovered that most [[Spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], then mostly thought to be [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral nebula|spiral nebulae]], had considerable redshifts.

==Measurement, characterization, and interpretation==
[[File:High-redshift galaxy candidates in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field 2012.jpg|thumb|High-redshift galaxy candidates in the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]] 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hubble census finds galaxies at redshifts 9 to 12|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1219/|accessdate=13 December 2012|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The [[visible spectrum|spectrum]] of light that comes from a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as [[spectral line|absorption lines]], [[spectral line|emission lines]], or other variations in [[Light intensity (disambiguation)|light intensity]]&lt;!--Intentionally ambiguous--&gt;. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the spectrum of various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common [[chemical element|atomic element]] in space is [[hydrogen]]. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a [[hydrogen spectrum|signature spectrum]] specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or [[white noise]] (random fluctuations in a spectrum).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, this 25 May 2004 [http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/about_swift/redshift.html press release] from [[NASA]]'s [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]] [[space telescope]] that is researching [[gamma-ray burst]]s: &quot;Measurements of the gamma-ray spectra obtained during the main outburst of the GRB have found little value as redshift indicators, due to the lack of well-defined features. However, optical observations of GRB afterglows have produced spectra with identifiable lines, leading to precise redshift measurements.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Redshift (and blueshift) may be characterized by the relative difference between the observed and emitted wavelengths (or frequency) of an object. In astronomy, it is customary to refer to this change using a [[dimensionless]] quantity called {{math|''z''}}. If {{math|''λ''}} represents wavelength and {{math|''f''}} represents frequency (note, {{math|''λf'' {{=}} ''c''}} where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]), then {{math|''z''}} is defined by the equations:&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/help/zdef.html] for a tutorial on how to define and interpret large redshift measurements.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

After {{math|''z''}} is measured, the distinction between redshift and blueshift is simply a matter of whether {{math|''z''}} is positive or negative. See the [[#Redshift formulae|formula section]] below for some basic interpretations that follow when either a redshift or blueshift is observed. For example, [[Doppler effect]] blueshifts ({{math|''z'' &lt; 0}}) are associated with objects approaching (moving closer to) the observer with the light shifting to greater [[energy|energies]]. Conversely, Doppler effect redshifts ({{math|''z'' &gt; 0}}) are associated with objects receding (moving away) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies. Likewise, gravitational blueshifts are associated with light emitted from a source residing within a weaker [[gravitational field]] as observed from within a stronger gravitational field, while gravitational redshifting implies the opposite conditions.

==Redshift formulae==
In general relativity one can derive several important special-case formulae for redshift in certain special spacetime geometries, as summarized in the following table. In all cases the magnitude of the shift (the value of {{math|''z''}}) is independent of the wavelength.&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt;

===Doppler effect===
{{main|Doppler effect|Relativistic Doppler effect}}
[[Image:Suzredshift.gif|thumb|Doppler effect, yellow (~575 [[nanometer|nm]] wavelength) ball appears greenish (blueshift to ~565 nm wavelength) approaching observer, turns [[Orange (colour)|orange]] (redshift to ~585 nm wavelength) as it passes, and returns to yellow when motion stops. To observe such a change in color, the object would have to be traveling at approximately 5200 [[kilometer per second|km/s]], or about 75 times faster than the speed record for the [[Helios II|fastest manmade space probe]].]]
If a source of the light is moving away from an observer, then redshift ({{math|''z'' &gt; 0}}) occurs; if the source moves towards the observer, then [[blueshift]] ({{math|''z'' &lt; 0}}) occurs. This is true for all electromagnetic waves and is explained by the [[Doppler effect]]. Consequently, this type of redshift is called the ''Doppler redshift''. If the source moves away from the observer with [[velocity]] {{math|''v''}}, which is much less than the speed of light ({{math|''v'' ≪ ''c''}}), the redshift is given by

:&lt;math&gt;z \approx \frac{v}{c}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (since &lt;math&gt;\gamma \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;)

where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. In the classical Doppler effect, the frequency of the source is not modified, but the recessional motion causes the illusion of a lower frequency.

A more complete treatment of the Doppler redshift requires considering relativistic effects associated with motion of sources close to the speed of light. A complete derivation of the effect can be found in the article on the [[relativistic Doppler effect]]. In brief, objects moving close to the speed of light will experience deviations from the above formula due to the [[time dilation]] of [[special relativity]] which can be corrected for by introducing the [[Lorentz factor]] {{math|''γ''}} into the classical Doppler formula as follows (for motion solely in the line of sight):

:&lt;math&gt;1 + z = \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right) \gamma.&lt;/math&gt;

This phenomenon was first observed in a 1938 experiment performed by Herbert E. Ives and G.R. Stilwell, called the [[Ives–Stilwell experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ives | first1 = H. | last2 = Stilwell | first2 = G. | year = 1938 | title = An Experimental study of the rate of a moving atomic clock | url = http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-28-7-215 | journal = J. Opt. Soc. Am. | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 215–226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Lorentz factor is dependent only on the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the velocity, this causes the redshift associated with the relativistic correction to be independent of the orientation of the source movement. In contrast, the classical part of the formula is dependent on the [[scalar resolute|projection]] of the movement of the source into the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] which yields different results for different orientations. If {{math|''θ''}} is the angle between the direction of  relative motion and the direction of emission in the observer's frame&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freund|first=Jurgen|title=Special Relativity for Beginners|date=2008|publisher=World Scientific|pages=120|isbn=981-277-160-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (zero angle is directly away from the observer), the full form for the relativistic Doppler effect becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;1+ z = \frac{1 + v \cos (\theta)/c}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and for motion solely in the line of sight ({{math|''θ'' {{=}} 0°}}), this equation reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt;1 + z = \sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}&lt;/math&gt;

For the special case that the light is approaching at [[right angle]]s ({{math|''θ'' {{=}} 90°}}) to the direction of relative motion in the observer's frame,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ditchburn|first=R|title=Light|date=1961|publisher=Dover|pages=329|isbn=0-12-218101-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relativistic redshift is known as the [[Transverse Doppler effect|transverse redshift]], and a redshift:

:&lt;math&gt;1 + z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

is measured, even though the object is not moving away from the observer. Even when the source is moving towards the observer, if there is a transverse component to the motion then there is some speed at which the dilation just cancels the expected blueshift and at higher speed the approaching source will be redshifted.&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;[http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/ross/phys2100/doppler.htm Photons, Relativity, Doppler shift]&quot; at the University of Queensland&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of space===
{{main|Metric expansion of space}}
In the early part of the twentieth century, Slipher, Hubble and others made the first measurements of the redshifts and blueshifts of galaxies beyond the [[Milky Way]]. They initially interpreted these redshifts and blueshifts as due solely to the Doppler effect, but later Hubble discovered a rough correlation between the increasing redshifts and the increasing distance of galaxies. Theorists almost immediately realized that these observations could be explained by a different mechanism for producing redshifts. [[Hubble's law]] of the correlation between redshifts and distances is required by models of cosmology derived from general relativity that have a [[metric expansion of space]].&lt;ref name=Eddington /&gt; As a result, photons propagating through the expanding space are stretched, creating the [[cosmological redshift]].

There is a distinction between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a [[Local reference frame|local]] Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being a consequence of relative velocities, the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a [[Spacetime topology|feature of the spacetime]] through which they are traveling that causes space to [[metric expansion of space|expand]].&lt;ref&gt;The distinction is made clear in {{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Edward Robert  |date= 2000 |title=Cosmology: The Science of the Universe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=2nd |url=http://books.google.com/?id=-8PJbcA2lLoC&amp;pg=PA315#PPA306,M1 |pages=306''ff'' |isbn=0-521-66148-X |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3{{e|8}} m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by [[Lorentz covariance]]).

====Mathematical derivation====
The observational consequences of this effect can be derived using [[Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric|the equations]] from [[general relativity]] that describe a [[cosmological principle|homogeneous and isotropic universe]].

To derive the redshift effect, use the [[geodesic equation]] for a light wave, which is

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=0=-c^2dt^2+\frac{a^2 dr^2}{1-kr^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{math|''ds''{{sup|2}}}} is the [[spacetime interval]]
* {{math|''dt''{{sup|2}}}} is the time interval
* {{math|''dr''{{sup|2}}}} is the spatial interval
* {{math|''c''}} is the speed of light
* {{math|''a''}} is the time-dependent cosmic [[scale factor (Universe)|scale factor]]
* {{math|''k''}} is the [[curvature]] per unit area.

For an observer observing the crest of a light wave at a position {{math|''r'' {{=}} 0}} and time {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''t''{{sub|now}}}}, the crest of the light wave was emitted at a time {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''t''{{sub|then}}}} in the past and a distant position {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''R''}}. Integrating over the path in both space and time that the light wave travels yields:

:&lt;math&gt;
c \int_{t_\mathrm{then}}^{t_\mathrm{now}} \frac{dt}{a}\; =
   \int_{R}^{0} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{1-kr^2}}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the wavelength of light is not the same for the two positions and times considered due to the changing properties of the metric. When the wave was emitted, it had a wavelength {{math|''&amp;lambda;''{{sub|then}}}}. The next crest of the light wave was emitted at a time

:&lt;math&gt;t=t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The observer sees the next crest of the observed light wave with a wavelength {{math|''&amp;lambda;''{{sub|now}}}} to arrive at a time

:&lt;math&gt;t=t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the subsequent crest is again emitted from {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''R''}} and is observed at {{math|''r'' {{=}} 0}}, the following equation can be written:

:&lt;math&gt;
c \int_{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}^{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c} \frac{dt}{a}\; =
   \int_{R}^{0} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{1-kr^2}}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side of the two integral equations above are identical which means

:&lt;math&gt;
c \int_{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}^{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c} \frac{dt}{a}\; =
c \int_{t_\mathrm{then}}^{t_\mathrm{now}} \frac{dt}{a}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the following manipulation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = \int_{t_\mathrm{then}}^{t_\mathrm{now}} \frac{dt}{a} - \int_{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}^{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c} \frac{dt}{a} \\
&amp; = \int_{t_\mathrm{then}}^{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}\frac{dt}{a}+\int_{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}^{t_\mathrm{now}}\frac{dt}{a}- \int_{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}^{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c} \frac{dt}{a} \\
&amp; = \int_{t_\mathrm{then}}^{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}\frac{dt}{a}-\left(\int_{t_\mathrm{now}}^{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}\frac{dt}{a}+\int_{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}^{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c} \frac{dt}{a}\right) \\
&amp; = \int_{t_\mathrm{then}}^{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}\frac{dt}{a}-\int_{t_\mathrm{now}}^{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c}\frac{dt}{a}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

we find that:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{t_\mathrm{now}}^{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c} \frac{dt}{a}\; =
\int_{t_\mathrm{then}}^{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c} \frac{dt}{a}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

For very small variations in time (over the period of one cycle of a light wave) the scale factor is essentially a constant ({{math|''a'' {{=}} ''a''{{sub|now}}}} today and {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''a''{{sub|then}}}} previously). This yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c}{a_\mathrm{now}}-\frac{t_\mathrm{now}}{a_\mathrm{now}}\; = \frac{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}{a_\mathrm{then}}-\frac{t_\mathrm{then}}{a_\mathrm{then}}
&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_\mathrm{now}}{\lambda_\mathrm{then}}=\frac{a_\mathrm{now}}{a_\mathrm{then}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of redshift provided [[#Measurement, characterization, and interpretation|above]], the equation

:&lt;math&gt;1+z = \frac{a_\mathrm{now}}{a_\mathrm{then}}&lt;/math&gt;

is obtained. In an expanding universe such as the one we inhabit, the scale factor is [[monotonic function|monotonically increasing]] as time passes, thus, {{math|''z''}} is positive and distant galaxies appear redshifted.

Using a model of the expansion of the Universe, redshift can be related to the age of an observed object, the so-called ''[[cosmic time]]–redshift relation''. Denote a density ratio as {{math|Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_0 = \frac {\rho}{ \rho_{crit}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt;}} the critical density demarcating a universe that eventually crunches from one that simply expands. This density is about three hydrogen atoms per thousand liters of space.&lt;ref Name=Weinberg&gt;{{cite book |author=Steven Weinberg |edition=2nd |title=[[The First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe]] | page=34 |isbn=0-465-02437-8 |date=1993 |publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; At large redshifts one finds:

====Distinguishing between cosmological and local effects====
For cosmological redshifts of {{math|''z'' &lt; 0.01}} additional Doppler redshifts and blueshifts due to the [[peculiar velocity|peculiar motions]] of the galaxies relative to one another cause a wide [[variance|scatter]] from the standard [[Hubble Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Measurements of the peculiar velocities out to 5 [[parsec|Mpc]] using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] were reported in 2003 by Karachentsev et al.

The redshifts of galaxies include both a component related to recessional velocity from expansion of the Universe, and a component related to [[peculiar motion]] (Doppler shift).&lt;ref&gt;Bedran,M.L.

It is as simple as that...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2000|p=315}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Weinberg]] clarified, &quot;The increase of wavelength from emission to absorption of light does not depend on the rate of change of {{math|''a''(''t'')}} [here {{math|''a''(''t'')}} is the [[cosmic scale factor|Robertson-Walker scale factor]]] at the times of emission or absorption, but on the increase of {{math|''a''(''t'')}} in the whole period from emission to absorption.&quot;&lt;ref name=Weinberg_Cosmology&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=48C-ym2EmZkC&amp;pg=PA11 |author=Steven Weinberg |title=Cosmology |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=11 |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-852682-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular literature often uses the expression &quot;Doppler redshift&quot; instead of &quot;cosmological redshift&quot; to describe the redshift of galaxies dominated by the expansion of spacetime, but the cosmological redshift is not found using the relativistic Doppler equation&lt;ref&gt;Odenwald &amp; Fienberg 1993&lt;/ref&gt; which is instead characterized by [[special relativity]]; thus {{math|''v'' &gt; ''c''}} is impossible while, in contrast, {{math|''v'' &gt; ''c''}} is possible for cosmological redshifts because the space which separates the objects (for example, a quasar from the Earth) can expand faster than the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;Speed faster than light is allowed because the [[metric expansion of space|expansion]] of the [[spacetime]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] is described by [[general relativity]] in terms of sequences of only locally valid inertial frames as opposed to a global [[Minkowski metric]]. Expansion faster than light is an integrated effect over many local inertial frames and is allowed because no single inertial frame is involved. The speed-of-light limitation applies only locally. See {{cite journal |author=Michal Chodorowski |title=Is space really expanding? A counterexample |date=2007 |arxiv=astro-ph/0601171 |journal=Concepts Phys |volume=4 |pages=17–34|bibcode = 2007ONCP....4...15C |doi = 10.2478/v10005-007-0002-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More mathematically, the viewpoint that &quot;distant galaxies are receding&quot; and the viewpoint that &quot;the space between galaxies is expanding&quot; are related by changing [[coordinate system]]s. Expressing this precisely requires working with the mathematics of the [[Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Weiss, What Causes the Hubble Redshift?, entry in the Physics [[FAQ]] (1994), available via [[John Baez]]'s [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/hubble.html website]&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Universe were contracting instead of expanding, we would see distant galaxies blueshifted by an amount proportional to their distance instead of redshifted.&lt;ref&gt;This is only true in a universe where there are no [[peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]]. Otherwise, redshifts combine as
:&lt;math&gt;1+z=(1+z_{\mathrm{Doppler}})(1+z_{\mathrm{expansion}})&lt;/math&gt;
which yields solutions where certain objects that &quot;recede&quot; are blueshifted and other objects that &quot;approach&quot; are redshifted. For more on this bizarre result see Davis, T. M., Lineweaver, C. H., and Webb, J. K. &quot;[http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104349/ Solutions to the tethered galaxy problem in an expanding universe and the observation of receding blueshifted objects]&quot;, ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'' (2003), '''71''' 358–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravitational redshift===
{{main|Gravitational redshift}}
In the theory of [[general relativity]], there is time dilation within a gravitational well. This is known as the [[gravitational redshift]] or ''Einstein Shift''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chant, C. A. | bibcode = 1930JRASC..24..390C | title = Notes and Queries (Telescopes and Observatory Equipment – The Einstein Shift of Solar Lines) | date = 1930 | journal = [[Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]] | volume = 24 | page = 390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical derivation of this effect follows from the [[Schwarzschild solution]] of the [[Einstein field equations|Einstein equations]] which yields the following formula for redshift associated with a photon traveling in the [[gravitational field]] of an [[electrical charge|uncharged]], [[rotation|nonrotating]], [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetric]] mass:

:&lt;math&gt;1+z=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}}},&lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{math|''G''}} is the [[gravitational constant]],
* {{math|''M''}} is the [[mass]] of the object creating the gravitational field,
* {{math|''r''}} is the radial coordinate of the source (which is analogous to the classical distance from the center of the object, but is actually a [[Schwarzschild coordinates|Schwarzschild coordinate]]), and
* {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]].

This gravitational redshift result can be derived from the assumptions of [[special relativity]] and the [[equivalence principle]]; the full theory of general relativity is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Einstein | first = A | authorlink = Albert Einstein | date = 1907 | title = Über das Relativitätsprinzip und die aus demselben gezogenen Folgerungen | journal = Jahrbuch der Radioaktivität und Elektronik | volume = 4 | pages = 411–462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect is very small but measurable on Earth using the [[Mössbauer effect]] and was first observed in the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.4.337 | title = Apparent Weight of Photons | date = 1960 | last1 = Pound | first1 = R. | last2 = Rebka | first2 = G. | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 337–341 | bibcode=1960PhRvL...4..337P}}. This paper was the first measurement.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is significant near a [[black hole]], and as an object approaches the [[event horizon]] the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (see [[Sachs-Wolfe effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sachs | first = R.

==Observations in astronomy==
The redshift observed in astronomy can be measured because the [[emission spectrum|emission]] and [[absorption spectrum|absorption]] spectra for [[atom]]s are distinctive and well known, calibrated from [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic experiments]] in [[laboratory|laboratories]] on Earth. When the redshift of various absorption and emission lines from a single astronomical object is measured, {{math|''z''}} is found to be remarkably constant. Although distant objects may be slightly blurred and lines broadened, it is by no more than can be explained by [[thermal motion|thermal]] or [[motion (physics)|mechanical motion]] of the source. For these reasons and others, the consensus among astronomers is that the redshifts they observe are due to some combination of the three established forms of Doppler-like redshifts. Alternative hypotheses and explanations for redshift such as [[tired light]] are not generally considered plausible.&lt;ref name=reboul&gt;When cosmological redshifts were first discovered, [[Fritz Zwicky]] proposed an effect known as tired light. While usually considered for historical interests, it is sometimes, along with [[intrinsic redshift]] suggestions, utilized by [[nonstandard cosmologies]]. In 1981, H. J. Reboul summarised many [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1981A%26AS...45..129R&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c23806 alternative redshift mechanisms] that had been discussed in the literature since the 1930s. In 2001, [[Geoffrey Burbidge]] remarked in a [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001PASP..113..899B&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML review] that the wider astronomical community has marginalized such discussions since the 1960s. Burbidge and [[Halton Arp]], while investigating the mystery of [[Quasar#History of quasar observation|the nature of quasars]], tried to develop alternative redshift mechanisms, and very few of their fellow scientists acknowledged let alone accepted their work. Moreover, Goldhaber ''et al.'' 2001; &quot;Timescale Stretch Parameterization of Type Ia Supernova B-Band Lightcurves&quot;, ''ApJ'' 558:359–386, 2001 September 1 pointed out that alternative theories are unable to account for timescale stretch observed in [[type Ia supernovae]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spectroscopy, as a measurement, is considerably more difficult than simple [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]], which measures the [[brightness]] of astronomical objects through certain [[filter (optics)|filters]].&lt;ref&gt;For a review of the subject of photometry, consider Budding, E., ''Introduction to Astronomical Photometry'', Cambridge University Press (September 24, 1993), ISBN 0-521-41867-4&lt;/ref&gt; When photometric data is all that is available (for example, the [[Hubble Deep Field]] and the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]), astronomers rely on a technique for measuring [[photometric redshift]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The technique was first described by Baum, W. A.: 1962, in G. C. McVittie (ed.), ''Problems of extra-galactic research'', p. 390, IAU Symposium No. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the broad wavelength ranges in photometric filters and the necessary assumptions about the nature of the spectrum at the light-source, [[observational error|errors]] for these sorts of measurements can range up to {{math|δ''z'' {{=}} 0.5}}, and are much less reliable than spectroscopic determinations.&lt;ref&gt;Bolzonella, M.; Miralles, J.-M.; Pelló, R., [http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003380 Photometric redshifts based on standard SED fitting procedures], ''[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]'', '''363''', p.476–492 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; However, photometry does at least allow a qualitative characterization of a redshift. For example, if a Sun-like spectrum had a redshift of {{math|''z'' {{=}} 1}}, it would be brightest in the [[infrared]] rather than at the yellow-green color associated with the peak of its [[blackbody spectrum]], and the light intensity will be reduced in the filter by a factor of four, {{math|(1 + ''z''){{sup|2}}}}. Both the photon count rate and the photon energy are redshifted. (See [[K correction]] for more details on the photometric consequences of redshift.)&lt;ref&gt;A pedagogical overview of the K-correction by David Hogg and other members of the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] collaboration can be found at [http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210394 astro-ph].&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture is a color-coded image of the doppler shift of the FeXIV 5308 Å line, caused by the coronal plasma velocity towards or away from the satellite.]]

In nearby objects (within our [[Milky Way]] galaxy) observed redshifts are almost always related to the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure [[velocity|velocities]] and parametrize the [[mass]]es of the [[orbit (celestial mechanics)|orbiting]] [[star]]s in [[spectroscopic binaries]], a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer [[William Huggins]].&lt;ref name=Huggins /&gt; Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers have been able to [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Radial velocity|diagnose and measure]] the presence and characteristics of [[extrasolar planet|planetary systems]] around other stars and have even made very [[Rossiter–McLaughlin effect|detailed differential measurements]] of redshifts during [[Transiting extrasolar planet|planetary transits]] to determine precise orbital parameters.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Exoplanet Tracker]] is the newest observing project to use this technique, able to track the redshift variations in multiple objects at once, as reported in {{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/505699 | title = The First Extrasolar Planet Discovered with a New‐Generation High‐Throughput Doppler Instrument | date = 2006 | last1 = Ge | first1 = Jian | display-authors = 4 | last2 = Van Eyken | first2 = Julian | last3 = Mahadevan | first3 = Suvrath | last4 = Dewitt | first4 = Curtis | last5 = Kane | first5 = Stephen R. | last6 = Cohen | first6 = Roger | last7 = Vanden Heuvel | first7 = Andrew | last8 = Fleming | first8 = Scott W. | last9 = Guo | first9 = Pengcheng | last10 = Henry | first10 = Gregory W. | last11 = Schneider | first11 = Donald P. | last12 = Ramsey | first12 = Lawrence W. | last13 = Wittenmyer | first13 = Robert A. | last14 = Endl | first14 = Michael | last15 = Cochran | first15 = William D. | last16 = Ford | first16 = Eric B. | last17 = Martin | first17 = Eduardo L. | last18 = Israelian | first18 = Garik | last19 = Valenti | first19 = Jeff | last20 = Montes | first20 = David | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 648 | pages = 683–695 | bibcode=2006ApJ...648..683G |arxiv = astro-ph/0605247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finely detailed measurements of redshifts are used in [[helioseismology]] to determine the precise movements of the [[photosphere]] of the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00243557 | title = Solar and stellar seismology | date = 1988 | last1 = Libbrecht | first1 = Keng | journal = Space Science Reviews | volume = 47 | issue = 3–4 |bibcode=1988SSRv...47..275L | pages=275–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redshifts have also been used to make the first measurements of the [[Period of revolution|rotation rates]] of [[planet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;In 1871 [[Hermann Carl Vogel]] measured the rotation rate of [[Venus]].

===Extragalactic observations===
The most distant objects exhibit larger redshifts corresponding to the [[Hubble's law|Hubble flow]] of the Universe. The largest observed redshift, corresponding to the greatest distance and furthest back in time, is that of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]; the [[Hubble's law#Redshift velocity|numerical value of its redshift]] is about {{math|''z'' {{=}} 1089}} ({{math|''z'' {{=}} 0}} corresponds to present time), and it shows the state of the [[Universe]] about 13.8 billion years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and 379,000 years after the initial moments of the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;An accurate measurement of the cosmic microwave background was achieved by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] experiment. The final published temperature of 2.73 K was reported in this paper: Fixsen, D. J.; Cheng, E. S.; Cottingham, D. A.; Eplee, R. E., Jr.; Isaacman, R. B.; Mather, J. C.; Meyer, S. S.; Noerdlinger, P. D.; Shafer, R. A.; Weiss, R.; Wright, E. L.; Bennett, C. L.; Boggess, N. W.; Kelsall, T.; Moseley, S. H.; Silverberg, R. F.; Smoot, G. F.; Wilkinson, D. T.. (1994). &quot;Cosmic microwave background dipole spectrum measured by the COBE FIRAS instrument&quot;, ''Astrophysical Journal'', 420, 445. The most accurate measurement as of 2006 was achieved by the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] experiment.&lt;/ref&gt;

The luminous point-like cores of [[quasar]]s were the first &quot;high-redshift&quot; ({{math|''z'' &gt; 0.1}}) objects discovered before the improvement of telescopes allowed for the discovery of other high-redshift galaxies.

For galaxies more distant than the [[Local Group]] and the nearby [[Virgo Cluster]], but within a thousand [[parsec|megaparsecs]] or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by [[Edwin Hubble]] and has come to be known as [[Hubble's law]]. [[Vesto Slipher]] was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about the year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he [[cosmic distance ladder|measured by other means]] to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on [[general relativity]], redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. [[Hubble's law]] follows in part from the [[Copernican principle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peebles-1993&quot;&gt;Peebles (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is usually not known how [[luminosity|luminous]] objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.

[[Gravitation|Gravitational interactions]] of galaxies with each other and clusters cause a significant [[variance|scatter]] in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The [[peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]] associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the [[mass]] of [[virial theorem|virialized objects]] in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]], and redshift maps of clusters showing a [[Fingers of God]] effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peebles-1993&quot;/&gt; This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the ''[[mass to light ratio]]'' (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Binney|author2=Scott Treimane |title=Galactic dynamics|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-08445-9|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hubble law's linear relationship between distance and redshift assumes that the rate of expansion of the Universe is constant. However, when the Universe was much younger, the expansion rate, and thus the Hubble &quot;constant&quot;, was larger than it is today. For more distant galaxies, then, whose light has been travelling to us for much longer times, the approximation of constant expansion rate fails, and the Hubble law becomes a non-linear integral relationship and dependent on the history of the expansion rate since the emission of the light from the galaxy in question. Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used, then, to determine the expansion history of the Universe and thus the matter and energy content.

While it was long believed that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang, recent observations of the redshift-distance relationship using [[Type Ia supernova]]e have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the Universe has [[Accelerating universe|begun to accelerate]].

===Highest redshifts===
[[Image:Distance compared to z.png|thumb|400px|Plot of distance (in [[giga]] [[light-year]]s) vs. redshift according to the [[Lambda-CDM model]]. {{math|''d{{sub|H}}''}} (in solid black) is the [[comoving distance]] from Earth to the location with the Hubble redshift ''z'' while {{math|''ct''{{sub|LB}}}} (in dotted red) is the speed of light multiplied by the lookback time to Hubble redshift {{math|''z''}}. The comoving distance is the physical [[Space-like#Space-like interval|space-like]] distance between here and the distant location, [[asymptote|asymptoting]] to the [[Universe#Size, age, contents, structure, and laws|size of the observable universe]] at some 47 billion light years. The lookback time is the distance a photon traveled from the time it was emitted to now divided by the speed of light, with a maximum distance of 13.8 billion light years corresponding to the [[age of the universe]].]]

Currently, the objects with the highest known redshifts are galaxies and the objects producing gamma ray bursts. The most reliable redshifts are from [[spectroscopic]] data, and the highest confirmed [[spectroscopic]] redshift of a galaxy is that of

''Extremely red objects'' (EROs) are [[Radio astronomy#Astronomical sources|astronomical sources]] of radiation that radiate energy in the red and near infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These may be starburst galaxies that have  a high redshift accompanied by reddening from intervening dust, or they could be highly redshifted elliptical galaxies with an older (and therefore redder) stellar population.&lt;ref&gt;

===Redshift surveys===
[[File:2dfgrs.png|thumb|Rendering of the 2dFGRS data]]
{{main|Redshift survey}}
With advent of automated [[telescope]]s and improvements in [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopes]], a number of collaborations have been made to map the Universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|large-scale structure]] of the Universe. The [[Great Wall (astronomy)|Great Wall]], a vast [[supercluster]] of galaxies over 500 million [[light-year]]s wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Geller &amp; J. P. Huchra, ''Science'' '''246''', 897 (1989). [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/246/4932/897 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first redshift survey was the [[CfA Redshift Survey]], started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;See the official CfA [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~huchra/zcat/ website] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] determined the large-scale structure of one section of the Universe, measuring redshifts for over 220,000 galaxies; data collection was completed in 2002, and the final [[data set]] was released 30 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09318.x|title=The 2dF galaxy redshift survey: Power-spectrum analysis of the final dataset and cosmological implications|author=Shaun Cole |author-link=Shaun Cole |journal=Mon.

==Effects due to physical optics or radiative transfer==
The interactions and phenomena summarized in the subjects of [[radiative transfer]] and [[physical optics]] can result in shifts in the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation. In such cases the shifts correspond to a physical energy transfer to matter or other photons rather than being due to a transformation between reference frames. These shifts can be due to such physical phenomena as [[Wolf effect|coherence effects]] or the [[scattering]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] whether from [[electric charge|charged]] [[elementary particle]]s, from particulates, or from fluctuations of the [[index of refraction]] in a [[dielectric medium]] as occurs in the radio phenomenon of [[Whistler (radio)|radio whistlers]].&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt; While such phenomena are sometimes referred to as &quot;redshifts&quot; and &quot;blueshifts&quot;, in astrophysics light-matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as &quot;reddening&quot; rather than &quot;redshifting&quot; which, as a term, is normally reserved for the [[#Redshift formulae|effects discussed above]].&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt;

In many circumstances scattering causes radiation to redden because [[entropy]] results in the predominance of many low-[[energy]] photons over few high-energy ones (while [[conservation of energy|conserving total energy]]).&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt; Except possibly under carefully controlled conditions, scattering does not produce the same relative change in wavelength across the whole spectrum; that is, any calculated {{math|''z''}} is generally a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of wavelength. Furthermore, scattering from [[randomness|random]] [[matter|media]] generally occurs at many [[angle]]s, and {{math|''z''}} is a function of the scattering angle. If multiple scattering occurs, or the scattering particles have relative motion, then there is generally distortion of [[spectral line]]s as well.&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt;

In [[interstellar medium|interstellar astronomy]], [[visible spectrum|visible spectra]] can appear redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon referred to as [[interstellar reddening]]&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt; – similarly [[Rayleigh scattering]] causes the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes the rest of the sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from red''shift''ing because the [[atomic spectral line|spectroscopic lines]] are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional [[extinction (astronomy)|dimming]] and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in and out of the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]].

'''Stiffness''' is the rigidity of an object &amp;mdash; the extent to which it resists [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] in response to an applied [[force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The complementary concept is '''flexibility''' or pliability:  the more flexible an object is, the less stiff it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=126 |chapter=Stiffness and flexibility |title=200 science investigations for young students |author=Martin Wenham |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7619-6349-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculations==
The stiffness, ''k'', of a body is a measure of the resistance offered by an elastic body to deformation. For an elastic body with a single [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] (DOF) (for example, stretching or compression of a rod), the stiffness is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac {F} {\delta} &lt;/math&gt;

where,

:''F'' is the force applied on the body
:&amp;delta; is the [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] produced by the force along the same degree of freedom (for instance,  the change in length of a stretched spring)

In the [[International System of Units]], stiffness is typically measured in [[Newton (unit)|newton]]s per meter. 
In Imperial units, stiffness is typically measured in [[Pound (force)|pound]]s(lbs) per inch.

Generally speaking, [[Deflection (engineering)|deflections]] (or motions) of an infinitesimal element (which is viewed as a point) in an elastic body can occur along multiple DOF (maximum of six DOF at a point). For example, a point on a horizontal [[Euler–Bernoulli beam equation|beam]] can undergo both a vertical [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] and a rotation relative to its undeformed axis. When there are M degrees of freedom a M x M [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] must be used to describe the stiffness at the point. The diagonal terms in the matrix are the direct-related stiffnesses (or simply stiffnesses) along the same degree of freedom and the off-diagonal terms are the coupling stiffnesses between two different degrees of freedom (either at the same or different points) or the same degree of freedom at two different points. In industry, the term '''influence coefficient''' is sometimes used to refer to the coupling stiffness.

It is noted that for a body with multiple DOF, the equation above generally does not apply since the applied force generates not only the deflection along its own direction (or degree of freedom), but also those along other directions.

For a body with multiple DOF, in order to calculate a particular direct-related stiffness (the diagonal terms), the corresponding DOF is left free while the remaining should be constrained. Under such a condition, the above equation can be used to obtain the direct-related stiffness for the degree of freedom which is unconstrained. The ratios between the reaction forces (or moments) and the produced deflection are the coupling stiffnesses.

A description including all possible stretch and shear parameters is given by the [[Hooke's law|elasticity tensor]].

== Compliance ==

The [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of stiffness is ''compliance'' (or sometimes ''elastic modulus''), typically measured in units of metres per newton. In rheology it may be defined as the ratio of strain to stress,&lt;ref&gt;V. GOPALAKRISHNAN and CHARLES F. ZUKOSKI;  &quot;Delayed flow in thermo-reversible colloidal gels&quot;;  Journal of Rheology;  Society of Rheology, U.S.A.;  July/August 2007;  51 (4): pp. 623–644.&lt;/ref&gt; and so take the units of reciprocal stress, ''e.g''. 1/[[pascal (unit)|Pa]].

== Rotational stiffness ==&lt;!-- [[Torsional rigidity]] redirects here --&gt;

A body may also have a rotational stiffness, ''k'', given by

:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac {M} {\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

where
: ''M'' is the applied [[moment (physics)|moment]]
: ''&amp;theta;'' is the rotation

In the SI system, rotational stiffness is typically measured in [[newton-metre]]s per [[radian]].

In the SAE system, rotational stiffness is typically measured in inch-[[Pound (force)|pound]]s per [[degree (angle)|degree]].

Further measures of stiffness are derived on a similar basis, including:

* shear stiffness - ratio of applied [[shear stress|shear]] force to shear deformation
* torsional stiffness - ratio of applied [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] moment to angle of twist

== Relationship to elasticity ==
In general, [[elastic modulus]] is not the same as stiffness.  Elastic modulus is a property of the constituent material; stiffness is a property of a structure.  That is, the modulus is an [[intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] of the material; stiffness, on the other hand, is an [[intensive and extensive properties|extensive property]] of the solid body dependent on the material ''and'' the shape and boundary conditions.  For example, for an element in [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] or [[compression (physical)|compression]], the axial stiffness is

:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac {AE} {L} &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''A'' is the cross-sectional area,
:''E'' is the (tensile) elastic modulus (or [[Young's modulus]]),
:''L'' is the length of the element.

Similarly, the rotational stiffness of a straight section is

:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac {GJ} {L} &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&quot;J&quot; is the [[torsion constant]] for the section,
:&quot;G&quot; is the rigidity modulus of the material

Note that in SI, these units yield &lt;math&gt;k : \frac{N \cdot m}{rad}&lt;/math&gt;. For the special case of unconstrained uniaxial tension or compression, [[Young's modulus]] ''can'' be thought of as a measure of the stiffness of a material.

== Applications ==
The stiffness of a structure is of principal importance in many engineering applications, so the [[modulus of elasticity]] is often one of the primary properties considered when selecting a material. A high modulus of elasticity is sought when [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] is undesirable, while a low modulus of elasticity is required when flexibility is needed.

In biology, the stiffness of the [[extracellular matrix]] is important for guiding the migration of cells in a phenomenon called [[durotaxis]].

In [[physics]] and [[engineering]], '''permeation''' (also called '''imbuing''') is the penetration of a permeate (such as a [[liquid]], [[gas]], or [[vapor]])  through a solid. It is directly related to the concentration gradient of the permeate, a material's [[intrinsic permeability]], and the materials' [[Mass diffusivity]]. Permeation is modeled by equations such as [[Fick's laws of diffusion]], and can be measured using tools such as a [[minipermeameter]].

== Description ==

The process of permeation involves the diffusion of molecules, called the permeant, through a membrane or interface. Permeation works through diffusion; the permeant will move from high concentration to low concentration across the interface. A material can be semipermeable, with the presence of a [[semipermeable membrane]]. Only molecules or ions with certain properties will be able to diffuse across such a membrane. This is a very important mechanism in biology where fluids inside a blood vessel need to be regulated and controlled. Permeation can occur through most materials including metals, ceramics and polymers. However, the permeability of metals is much lower than that of ceramics and polymers due to their crystal structure and porosity.
 
Permeation is something that must be regarded highly in various polymer applications, due to their high permeability. Permeability depends on the temperature of the interaction as well as the characteristics of both the polymer and the permeant component. Through the process of [[sorption]], molecules of the permeant can be either absorbed or adsorbed at the interface. The permeation of a material can be measured through numerous methods that quantify the permeability of a substance through a specific material.

Permeability is measured in units of area, commonly meters squared. It can be measured in a darcy or millidarcy popularized by [[Henry Darcy]]. They are not official SI units, however they are widely used. The permeability coefficient can be calculated in Barrers. Standard SI units for temperature, time, distance and pressure are used for the gasses and diffusion coefficients used to calculate permeability.

== Related terms ==
* Permeant: The substance or species, ion, molecules permeating through the solid. 
* Semipermeability: Property of a material to be permeable only for some substances and not for others.
* Permeation measurement: Method for the quantification of the permeability of a material for a specific substance.

== History ==

=== Abbé Jean-Antoine Nollet (physicist, 1700–1770) ===
[[Jean-Antoine Nollet|Nollet]] tried to seal wine containers with a [[pig's bladder]] and stored them under water. After a while the bladder bulged outwards. He noticed the high pressure that discharged after he pierced the bladder. Curious, he did the experiment the other way round: he filled the container with water and stored it in wine. The result was a bulging inwards of the bladder. His notes about this experiment are the first scientific mention of permeation (later it would be called semipermeability).

=== Thomas Graham (chemist, 1805–1869) ===
[[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Graham]] experimentally proved the dependency of gas [[diffusion]] on [[molecular weight]], which is now known as [[Graham's law]].

=== Richard Barrer (1910–1996) ===
Barrer developed the modern [[Barrer]] measurement technique, and first used scientific methods for measuring permeation rates.

== Permeation in everyday life ==

* [[Packaging]]: The permeability of the package (materials, seals, closures, etc.) needs to be matched with the sensitivity of the package contents and the specified [[shelf life]].  Some packages must have nearly [[hermetic seal]]s  while others can (and sometimes must) be selectively permeable.  Knowledge about the exact permeation rates is therefore essential.
[[File:Fuel cell still.gif|thumbnail|Fuel Cell Configuration]]
* [[Tires]]: Air pressure in tires should decrease as slowly as possible. A good tire is one that allows the least amount of gas to escape. Permeation will occur over time with the tires, so it is best to know the permeability of the material that will make up the tire with the desired gas to make the most efficient tires.   
* Insulating material: Water vapour permeation of insulating material is important as well as for submarine cables to protect the conductor from corrosion.
* [[Fuel cell]]s: Automobiles are equipped with Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells to convert hydrogen fuel and oxygen found in the atmosphere to produce electricity. However, these cells only  produce around 1.16 volts of electricity. In order to power a vehicle, multiple cells are arranged into a stack. A stack's power output depends on both the number and the size of the individual fuel cells. 
* Thermoplastic and Thermosetting Piping: Pipes intended to transport water under high pressure can be considered as failed when there is a detectable permeation of water through the pipe wall to the outer surface of the pipe.
* Medical Uses: Permeation can also be seen in the medical field in drug delivery. Drug patches made up of polymer material contain a chemical reservoir that is loaded beyond its solubility, and then transferred to the body through contact. In order for the chemical to release itself into the body, it must permeate and diffuse through the polymer membrane, according to the concentration gradient. Due to the over solubility of the reservoir, transport of the drug follows the burst and lag mechanism. There is a high transfer rate of the drug when the patch makes contact with the skin, but as time increases a concentration gradient is established, meaning delivery of the drug settles to a constant rate. This is crucial in drug delivery and is used in cases such as the Ocusert System.

== Permeation measurement ==

[[image:Permeation sweep gas.gif|thumb|Permeation measurement with sweep gas]]

The permeation of [[films]] and membranes can be measured with any gas or liquid. One method uses a central module which is separated by the test film: the testing gas is fed on the one side of the cell and the permeated gas is carried to the detector by a sweep gas. The diagram on the right shows a testing cell for films, normally made from metals like [[stainless steel]]. The photo shows a testing cell for pipes made from glass, similar to a [[Liebig condenser]]. The testing medium (liquid or gas) is situated in the inner white pipe and the permeate is collected in the space between the pipe and the glass wall. It is transported by a sweep gas (connected to the upper and lower joint) to an analysing device.

Permeation can also be measured through intermittent contact. This method involves taking a sample of the test chemical and placing it on the surface of the material whose permeability is being observed while adding or removing specific amounts of the test chemical. After a known amount of time, the material is analyzed to find the concentration of the test chemical present throughout its structure. Along with the amount of time the chemical was on the material and the analysis of the test material, one can determine the cumulative permeation of the test chemical.

The following table gives examples of the calculated permeability coefficient of certain gases through a silicone membrane.

== Approximation using Fick's First law==

The flux or flow of mass of the permeate through the solid can be modeled by [[Fick's laws of diffusion#Fick.27s first law|Fick's first law]].

:&lt;math&gt;\bigg. J = - D \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \bigg. &lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be modified to a very simple formula that can be used in basic problems to approximate permeation through a membrane.

:&lt;math&gt;\bigg. J = - D \frac{(C_2 - C_1)}{\delta} \bigg. &lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt; J&lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;diffusion flux&quot;

* &lt;math&gt;\, D&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion coefficient or [[mass diffusivity]]

* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of the permeate

* &lt;math&gt;\, \delta &lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the membrane

We can introduce &lt;math&gt; S&lt;/math&gt;  into this equation, which represents the sorption equilibrium parameter, which is the constant of proportionality between pressure (&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. This relationship can be represented as &lt;math&gt;C=Sp&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\bigg. J = - D \frac{S(p_2 - p_1)}{\delta} \bigg. &lt;/math&gt;

The diffusion coefficient can be combined with the sorption equilibrium parameter to get the final form of the equation, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the permeability of the membrane. The relationship being &lt;math&gt; P = SD&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bigg. J = -\frac{P(p_2 - p_1)}{\delta} \bigg. &lt;/math&gt;

==Solubility of a gas in a metal==
In practical applications when looking at gases permeating metals, there is a way to relate gas pressure to concentration. Many gases exist as diatomic molecules when in the gaseous phase, but when permeating metals they exist in their singular ionic form. [[Sieverts' law]] states that the solubility of a gas, in the form of a diatomic molecule, in metal is proportional to the square root of the partial pressure of the gas.

The flux can be approximated in this case by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\bigg. J = - D \frac{(S_1 - S_2)}{\delta} \bigg. &lt;/math&gt;

We can introduce &lt;math&gt; K&lt;/math&gt;  into this equation, which represents the [[Sieverts' law|reaction equilibrium constant]]. From the relationship &lt;math&gt;S  =  {K \sqrt{p_N}}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\bigg. J = - D \frac{K(\sqrt{p_1} - \sqrt{p_2})}{\delta} \bigg. &lt;/math&gt;

The diffusion coefficient can be combined with the reaction equilibrium constant to get the final form of the equation, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the permeability of the membrane. The relationship being &lt;math&gt; P = KD&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bigg. J = - \frac{P(\sqrt{p_1} - \sqrt{p_2})}{\delta} \bigg. &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Clayton Anderson zero g.jpg|thumb|right|The cohesive character of [[water]] is clearly noticeable.]]

'''Cohesion''' (''n''. lat. ''cohaerere'' &quot;stick or stay together&quot;) or '''cohesive attraction''' or '''cohesive force''' is the action or [[chemical property|property]] of like [[molecule]]s sticking together, being mutually [[intermolecular attraction|attractive]]. It is an intrinsic property of a [[Chemical substance|substance]] that is caused by the shape and structure of its molecules, which makes the distribution of orbiting [[electron]]s irregular when molecules get close to one another, creating [[Coulomb force|electrical attraction]] that can maintain a microscopic structure such as a [[drop (liquid)|water drop]]. In other words, cohesion allows for [[surface tension]], creating a &quot;solid-like&quot; state upon which light (in weight) or low-density materials can be placed.

[[Image:Hg_Mercury.jpg|thumb|left|180px| [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] exhibits more cohesion than adhesion with glass.]]
[[Water]], for example, is strongly cohesive as each molecule may make four [[hydrogen bonds]] to other water molecules in a [[tetrahedral]] configuration. This results in a relatively strong [[Coulomb force]] between molecules. In simple terms, the polarity (state of which a molecule is oppositely charged on its poles) of water molecules allows them to be attracted towards each other. The polarity is due to the electronegativity of the atom of oxygen ; oxygen is more electronegative than the atoms of hydrogen, so the electrons they share through the covalent bonds are more often close to oxygen rather than hydrogen : these are called polar covalent bonds, covalent bonds between atoms that thus become oppositely charged.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Campbell, Biology, 9th edition, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a water molecule, the hydrogen atoms carry positive charges while the oxygen atom has a negative charge. This charge polarization within the molecule allows it to align with adjacent molecules through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, rendering the bulk liquid cohesive. [[Van der Waals equation|Van der Waals gases]] such as [[methane]], however, have weak cohesion due only to [[Van der Waals forces]] that operate by induced [[Chemical polarity|polarity]]  in non-polar molecules.

Cohesion, along with [[adhesion]] (attraction between unlike molecules), helps explain phenomena such as [[meniscus]], [[surface tension]] and [[capillary action]].

[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] in a [[glass]] [[Laboratory flask|flask]] is a good example of the effects of the ratio between cohesive and adhesive forces. Because of its high cohesion and low adhesion to the glass, mercury does not spread out to cover the top of the flask, and if enough is placed in the flask to cover the bottom, it exhibits a strongly [[wikt:convex|convex]] meniscus, whereas the meniscus of water is [[wikt:concave|concave]]. Mercury will not [[Wetting|wet]] the glass, unlike water and many other [[liquid]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=MFQAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=mercury+cohesion#v=onepage&amp;q=mercury%20cohesion&amp;f=false ''Common science'' by Carleton Wolsey Washburne]&lt;/ref&gt; and if the glass is tipped, it will 'roll' around inside.

==Mathematical definition==
'''Radiant energy density''', denoted ''w''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with photometric quantities), is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;Rusňák&quot;&gt;Karel Rusňák. [http://www.kfy.zcu.cz/dokumenty/FYA2/prenos.en.elmg.vln.pdf Přenos energie elektromagnetickým vlněním]. Department of Physics, Faculty of Applied Sciences, [[University of West Bohemia]]. 2005-11. Visited 2013-10-06&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;w_\mathrm{e} = \frac{\partial Q_\mathrm{e}}{\partial V},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*∂ is the [[partial derivative]] symbol;
*''Q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the radiant energy;
*''V'' is the volume.

==Relation to other radiometric quantities==
Because radiation always ''transmits'' the energy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rusňák&quot; /&gt; it is useful to wonder what the speed of the transmission is. If all the radiation at given location propagates in the same direction, then the radiant flux through a unit area perpendicular to the propagation direction is given by the [[irradiance]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Rusňák&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{e} = c w_\mathrm{e},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the radiation propagation speed.

Contrarily if the radiation intensity is equal in all directions, like in a cavity in a [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], then the energy transmition is best described by [[radiance]]:&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck. [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7154661M The Theory of Heat Radiation]. Equation 21. 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_\mathrm{e} = \frac{c}{4\pi} w_\mathrm{e}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Radiant exitance]] through a small opening from such a cavity is:&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck. [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7154661M The Theory of Heat Radiation]. Equation 7. 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{e} = \pi L_\mathrm{e} = \frac{c}{4} w_\mathrm{e}.&lt;/math&gt;
These relations can be used for example in the [[black-body radiation]] equation's derivation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4896">In [[fluid mechanics]], '''displacement''' occurs when an object is immersed in a [[fluid]], pushing it out of the way and taking its place. The volume of the fluid displaced can then be measured, and from this the volume of the immersed object can be deduced (the volume of the immersed object will be exactly equal to the volume of the displaced fluid).

An object that sinks displaces an amount of fluid equal to the object's volume. Thus [[buoyancy]] is expressed through [[Archimedes' principle]], which states that the [[weight]] of the object is reduced by its volume multiplied by the [[density]] of the fluid. If the weight of the object is less than this displaced quantity, the object floats; if more, it sinks. The amount of fluid displaced is directly related (via Archimedes' Principle) to its volume.

In the case of an object that sinks (is totally submerged), the volume of the object is displaced. In the case of an object that floats, the amount of fluid displaced will be equal in '''weight''' to the displacing object.

[[Archimedes Principle]], physical law of buoyancy, stating that any body completely or partially submerged in a fluid (gas or liquid) at rest is acted upon by an upward, or buoyant, force the magnitude of which is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body. The volume of displaced fluid is equivalent to the volume of an object fully immersed in a fluid or to that fraction of the volume below the surface for an object partially submerged in a liquid. The weight of the displaced portion of the fluid is equivalent to the magnitude of the buoyant force. The buoyant force on a body floating in a liquid or gas is also equivalent in magnitude to the weight of the floating object and is opposite in direction; the object neither rises nor sinks. If the weight of an object is less than that of the displaced fluid, the object rises, as in the case of a block of wood that is released beneath the surface of water or a helium-filled balloon that is let loose in air. An object heavier than the amount of the fluid it displaces, though it sinks when released, has an apparent weight loss equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. In fact, in some accurate weighing, a correction must be made in order to compensate for the buoyancy effect of the surrounding air. The buoyant force, which always opposes gravity, is nevertheless caused by gravity. Fluid pressure increases with depth because of the (gravitational) weight of the fluid above. This increasing pressure applies a force on a submerged object that increases with depth. The result is buoyancy. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/32827/Archimedes-principle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of displacement==
This method can be used to [[measurement|measure]] the volume of a solid object, even if its form is not regular. Several methods of such measuring exist. In one case the increase of liquid level is registered as the object is immersed into the liquid (usually water). In the second case the object is immersed into a vessel full of liquid (called an [[overflow can]]), causing it to overflow. Then the spilled liquid is collected and its volume measured. In the third case the object is suspended under the surface of the liquid and the increase of weight of the vessel is measured. The increase in weight is equal to the amount of liquid displaced by the object, which is the same as the volume of the suspended object times the density of the liquid.&lt;ref name=&quot;StephenWHughes2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes |first1=Stephen W. |year=2005 |title=Archimedes revisited: a faster, better, cheaper method of accurately measuring the volume of small objects |journal=[[Physics Education]] |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=468–474 |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0031-9120/40/5/008/ |doi=10.1088/0031-9120/40/5/008 |bibcode = 2005PhyEd..40..468H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[Archimedes' principle]] is that an object immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The weight of the displaced fluid can be found mathematically. The mass of the displaced fluid can be expressed in terms of the density and its volume, {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''ρV''}}. The fluid displaced has a weight {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''mg''}}, where {{math|''g''}} is [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration due to gravity]]. Therefore, the weight of the displaced fluid can be expressed as {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''ρVg''}}. 

The weight of an object or substance can be measured by floating a sufficiently buoyant receptacle in the cylinder and noting the water level. After placing the object or substance in the receptacle, the difference in weight of the water level volumes will equal the weight of the object.

&lt;!--Do NOT redirect this page to &quot;Intensity&quot;. Radiant intensity is a different quantity, with different units!--&gt;

In [[radiometry]], '''radiant intensity'''&lt;!--DO NOT LINK: general use of term--&gt; is the [[radiant flux]] emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit [[solid angle]], and '''spectral intensity''' is the radiant intensity per unit [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]], depending on whether the [[Spectral radiometric quantity|spectrum]] is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. These are ''directional'' quantities. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of radiant intensity is the [[watt]] per [[steradian]] ({{nobreak|W/sr}}), while that of spectral intensity in frequency is the watt per steradian per [[hertz]] ({{nobreak|W·sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and that of spectral intensity in wavelength is the watt per steradian per metre ({{nobreak|W·sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}})—commonly the watt per steradian per nanometre ({{nobreak|W·sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·nm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}). Radiant intensity is distinct from [[irradiance]] and [[radiant exitance]], which are often called ''[[intensity (physics)|intensity]]'' in branches of [[physics]] other than radiometry. In [[radio-frequency engineering]], radiant intensity is sometimes called '''radiation intensity'''.

==Mathematical definitions==
===Radiant intensity===
'''Radiant intensity''', denoted ''I''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω&lt;/sub&gt; (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with photometric quantities, and &quot;Ω&quot; to indicate this is a ''directional'' quantity), is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16943|title=Thermal insulation — Heat transfer by radiation — Physical quantities and definitions|work=ISO 9288:1989|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] catalogue|year=1989|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{e},\Omega} = \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \Omega},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*∂ is the [[partial derivative]] symbol;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received;
*''Ω'' is the solid angle.

In general, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω&lt;/sub&gt; is a function of viewing angle ''θ'' and potentially [[azimuth angle]]. For the special case of a [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian surface]], ''I''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω&lt;/sub&gt; follows the [[Lambert's cosine law]] ''I''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω&lt;/sub&gt; = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; cos ''θ''.

When calculating the radiant intensity emitted by a source, ''Ω'' refers to the solid angle into which the light is emitted. When calculating radiance received by a detector, ''Ω'' refers to the solid angle subtended by the source as viewed from that detector.

===Spectral intensity===
'''Spectral intensity in frequency''', denoted ''I''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω,ν&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{e},\Omega,\nu} = \frac{\partial I_{\mathrm{e},\Omega}}{\partial \nu},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ν'' is the frequency.

'''Spectral intensity in wavelength''', denoted ''I''&lt;sub&gt;e,Ω,λ&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{e},\Omega,\lambda} = \frac{\partial I_{\mathrm{e},\Omega}}{\partial \lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' is the wavelength.

==Radio-frequency engineering==
Radiant intensity is used to characterize the emission of radiation by an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Antennas_for_all_applications&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Antennas for all applications|edition=3rd|first1=John|last1=de Kraus|first2=Ronald J.|last2=Marhefka|date=2002|isbn=0-07-232103-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{e},\Omega} = E_\mathrm{e}(r) \, r^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''E''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[irradiance]] of the antenna;
*''r'' is the distance from the antenna.

Unlike power density, radiant intensity does not depend on distance: because radiant intensity is defined as the power through a solid angle, the decreasing power density over distance due to the [[inverse-square law]] is offset by the increase in area with distance.

Radiant intensity can as well characterize [[X-ray tube]] with filtration. X-ray tube output is defined for this purpose.

In [[physics]], the '''angular velocity''' is defined as the rate of change of [[angular displacement]] and is a [[vector (geometry)|vector]] quantity (more precisely, a [[pseudovector]]) which specifies the [[angular speed]] ([[rotational speed]]) of an object and the axis about which the object is rotating. The [[SI]] unit of angular velocity is [[radians per second]], although it may be measured in other units such as degrees per second, degrees per hour, etc. Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol [[omega]] ('''ω''', rarely '''Ω''').

The direction of the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of rotation, in a direction which is usually specified by the [[right-hand rule]].&lt;ref name= EM1&gt;{{cite book

== Angular velocity of a particle ==

=== Particle in two dimensions ===
[[Image:Angular velocity1.svg|right|256 px|thumb|The angular velocity of the particle at P with respect to the origin O is determined by the [[perpendicular component]] of the velocity vector '''v'''.]]

[[Image:Angular velocity.svg|thumb|250px|The angular velocity describes the speed of [[rotation]] and the orientation of the instantaneous axis about which the rotation occurs. The direction of the angular velocity pseudovector will be along the axis of rotation; in this case (counter-clockwise rotation) the vector points up.]]

The angular velocity of a particle is measured around or relative to a point, called the origin. As shown in the diagram (with angles ''ɸ'' and ''θ'' in [[radian]]s), if a line is drawn from the origin (O) to the particle (P), then the velocity ('''v''') of the particle has a component along the radius (radial component, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;‖&lt;/sub&gt;) and a component perpendicular to the radius (cross-radial component, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;). If there is no radial component, then the particle moves in a circle. On the other hand, if there is no cross-radial component, then the particle moves along a straight line from the origin.

A radial motion produces no change in the direction of the particle relative to the origin, so for purposes of finding the angular velocity the radial component can be ignored. Therefore, the rotation is completely produced by the perpendicular motion around the origin, and the angular velocity is completely determined by this component.

In two dimensions the angular velocity ''ω'' is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{d\phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

This is related to the cross-radial (tangential) velocity by:&lt;ref name= EM1/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{v}_\perp=r\,\frac{d\phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

An explicit formula for  '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of '''v''' and ''θ'' is:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{v}_\perp=|\mathrm{\mathbf{v}}|\,\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the above equations gives a formula for ''ω'':

: &lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{|\mathrm{\mathbf{v}}|\sin(\theta)}{|\mathrm{\mathbf{r}}|}&lt;/math&gt;

In two dimensions the angular velocity is a single number with an orientation but no direction. The angular velocity in two dimensions is a [[pseudoscalar]], a quantity that changes its sign under a [[parity (physics)|parity inversion]] (for example if one of the axes is inverted or if axes are swapped). The positive direction of rotation is taken, by convention, to be in the direction towards the ''y'' axis from the ''x'' axis. If the parity is inverted, but the orientation of a rotation is not, then the sign of the angular velocity changes.

There are three types of angular velocity involved in the movement on an ellipse corresponding to the three anomalies (true, eccentric and mean).

=== Particle in three dimensions ===
In three dimensions, the angular velocity becomes a bit more complicated. The angular velocity in this case is generally thought of as a vector, or more precisely, a [[pseudovector]]. It now has not only a magnitude, but a direction as well. The magnitude is the angular speed, and the direction describes the [[axis of rotation]]. The [[right-hand rule]] indicates the positive direction of the angular velocity pseudovector.

Let &lt;math&gt;\bold u&lt;/math&gt; be a unitary vector along the instantaneous rotation axis, so that from the top of the vector the rotation is counter-clock-wise. The angular velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega&lt;/math&gt; is then defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega = \frac{d\phi}{dt}\bold u&lt;/math&gt;

Just as in the two dimensional case, a particle will have a component of its velocity along the radius from the origin to the particle, and another component perpendicular to that radius. The combination of the origin point and the perpendicular component of the velocity defines a [[plane of rotation]] in which the behavior of the particle (for that instant) appears just as it does in the two dimensional case. The axis of rotation is then a line normal to this plane, and this axis defined the direction of the angular velocity pseudovector, while the magnitude is the same as the pseudoscalar value found in the 2-dimensional case. Using the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\bold u&lt;/math&gt; defined before, the angular velocity vector may be written in a manner similar to that for two dimensions:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=\frac{|\bold v|\sin(\theta)}{|\bold r|}\bold u&lt;/math&gt;

which, by the definition of the [[cross product]], can be written:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=\frac{\bold r\times\bold v}{|\bold r|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Addition of angular velocity vectors ====
If a point rotates with &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt; in a [[Frame of a vector space|frame]] &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; which rotates itself with angular speed &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; with respect to an external frame &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt;, we can define the addition of &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 + \omega_2&lt;/math&gt; as the angular velocity vector of the point with respect to &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt;.

With this operation defined like this, angular velocity, which is a pseudovector, becomes also a real vector because it has two operations:
* An internal operation (addition) which is associative, commutative, distributive and with zero and unity elements
* An external operation (external product), with the normal properties for an external product.

This is the definition of a [[Vector space#Definition|vector space]]. The only property that presents difficulties to prove is the commutativity of the addition. This can be proven from the fact that the velocity tensor W (see below) is skew-symmetric. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;R=e^{Wt}&lt;/math&gt; is a rotation matrix and in a time dt is an infinitesimal rotation matrix. Therefore, it can be expanded as &lt;math&gt;R = I + W\cdot dt + {1 \over 2} (W \cdot dt)^2 + ...&lt;/math&gt;

The composition of rotations is not commutative, but when they are infinitesimal rotations the first order approximation of the previous series can be taken and &lt;math&gt;(I+W_1\cdot dt)(I+W_2 \cdot dt)=(I+W_2 \cdot dt)(I+W_1\cdot dt)&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 + \omega_2 = \omega_2 + \omega_1 &lt;/math&gt;

== Rotating frames ==
Given a rotating frame composed by three unitary vectors, all the three must have the same angular speed in any instant. In such a frame each vector is a particular case of the previous case (moving particle), in which the module of the vector is constant.

Though it just a particular case of a moving particle, this is a very important one for its relationship with the [[rigid body]] study, and special tools have been developed for this case. There are two possible ways to describe the angular velocity of a rotating frame: the angular velocity vector and the angular velocity tensor. Both entities are related and they can be calculated from each other.

=== Angular velocity vector for a frame ===
It is defined as the angular velocity of each of the vectors of the frame, in a consistent way with the general definition.

It is known by the [[Euler's rotation theorem]] that for a rotating frame there exists an [[instantaneous axis of rotation]] in any instant. In the case of a frame, the angular velocity vector is over the instantaneous axis of rotation.

Any transversal section of a plane perpendicular to this axis has to behave as a two dimensional rotation. Thus, the magnitude of the angular velocity vector at a given time ''t'' is consistent with the two dimensions case.

Angular velocity is a vector defining an addition operation. Components can be calculated from the derivatives of the parameters defining the moving frame (Euler angles or rotation matrices)

==== Addition of angular velocity vectors in frames ====
[[image:gimbaleuler.svg|thumb|Schematic construction for addition of angular velocity vectors for rotating frames]]

As in the general case, the addition operation for angular velocity vectors can be defined using movement composition. In the case of rotating frames, the movement composition is simpler than the general case because the final matrix is always a product of rotation matrices.

As in the general case, addition is commutative &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 + \omega_2 = \omega_2 + \omega_1 &lt;/math&gt;

==== Components from the vectors of the frame ====
Substituting in the expression

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=\frac{\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}}{|\mathrm{\mathbf{r}}|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

any vector '''e''' of the frame we obtain &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=\frac{\boldsymbol e\times\dot{\boldsymbol e}}{|{\mathbf e}|^2}&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega = \mathbf{e}_1\times\dot{\mathbf{e}}_1=\mathbf{e}_2\times\dot{\mathbf{e}}_2=\mathbf{e}_3\times\dot{\mathbf{e}}_3.&lt;/math&gt;

As the columns of the matrix of the frame are the components of its vectors, this allows also to calculate &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; from the matrix of the frame and its derivative.

==== Components from Euler angles ====
[[Image:Eulerframe.svg|thumb|Diagram showing Euler frame in green]]

The components of the angular velocity pseudovector were first calculated by [[Leonhard Euler]] using his [[Euler angles]] and an intermediate frame made out of the intermediate frames of the construction:
* One axis of the reference frame (the precession axis)
* The line of nodes of the moving frame respect the reference frame (nutation axis)
* One axis of the moving frame (the intrinsic rotation axis)

Euler proved that the projections of the angular velocity pseudovector over these three axes was the derivative of its associated angle (which is equivalent to decompose the instant rotation in three instantaneous [[Euler rotations]]). Therefore:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vti.mod.gov.rs/ntp/rad2007/3-07/hedr/hedr.pdf K.S.HEDRIH: Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) and rigid body dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega = \dot\alpha\bold u_1+\dot\beta\bold u_2+\dot\gamma \bold u_3&lt;/math&gt;

This basis is not orthonormal and it is difficult to use, but now the velocity vector can be changed to the fixed frame or to the moving frame with just a change of bases. For example, changing to the mobile frame:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega = (\dot\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma+\dot\beta\cos\gamma)\bold I+(\dot\alpha\sin\beta\cos\gamma-\dot\beta\sin\gamma)\bold J +(\dot\alpha\cos\beta+\dot\gamma)\bold K&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bold I,\bold J,\bold K&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors for the frame fixed in the moving body. This example has been made using the Z-X-Z convention for Euler angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeroengineering.info/angspeedconventions.html |title=online tool to calculate angular speed vectors |publisher=Aeroengineering.info |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Components from infinitesimal rotation matrices ====
The components of the angular velocity vector can be calculated from [[Skew-symmetric matrix#Infinitesimal rotations|infinitesimal rotations]] (if available) as follows:
* As any rotation matrix has a single real eigenvalue, which is +1, this eigenvalue shows the rotation axis.
* Its module can be deduced from the value of the infinitesimal rotation.

=== Angular velocity tensor ===
{{see also|Skew-symmetric matrix}}

It can be introduced from rotation matrices. Any vector &lt;math&gt;\vec r&lt;/math&gt; that rotates around an axis with an angular speed vector &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega&lt;/math&gt; (as defined before) satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d \vec r(t)} {dt} = \vec{\omega} \times\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;

We can introduce here the '''angular velocity tensor''' associated to the angular speed &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;

W(t) =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -\omega_z(t) &amp; \omega_y(t) \\
\omega_z(t) &amp; 0 &amp; -\omega_x(t) \\
-\omega_y(t) &amp; \omega_x(t) &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This tensor W(t) will act as if it were a &lt;math&gt;(\vec \omega \times)&lt;/math&gt; operator :

: &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega(t) \times \vec{r}(t) = W(t) \vec{r}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

Given the orientation matrix A(t) of a frame, we can obtain its instant '''angular velocity tensor''' W as follows. We know that:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {d \vec r(t)} {dt} = W \cdot \vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;

As angular speed must be the same for the three vectors of a rotating frame, if we have a matrix A(t) whose columns are the vectors of the frame, we can write for the three vectors as a whole:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dA(t)} {dt} = W \cdot A (t)&lt;/math&gt;

And therefore the angular velocity tensor we are looking for is:

: &lt;math&gt;W = \frac {dA(t)} {dt} \cdot A^{-1}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Properties of angular velocity tensors {{anchor|Angular velocity tensor}} ===
{{see also|Infinitesimal rotation}}

In general, the angular velocity in an n-dimensional space is the time derivative of the angular displacement tensor which is a second rank [[skew-symmetric tensor]].

This tensor W will have n(n-1)/2 independent components and this number is the dimension of the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Lie group]] of [[rotations]] of an ''n''-dimensional inner product space.&lt;ref name=&quot;baez&quot;&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/classical/galilei2.pdf Rotations and Angular Momentum] on the Classical Mechanics page of [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/README.html the website of John Baez], especially Questions 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Exponential of W ====
In three dimensions angular velocity can be represented by a pseudovector because second rank tensors are [[dual space|dual]] to pseudovectors in three dimensions.

As &lt;math&gt;\frac {dA(t)} {dt} = W\cdot A(t)&lt;/math&gt;. This can be read as a differential equation that defines A(t) knowing W(t).

:: &lt;math&gt;\frac {dA(t)} {A} = W \cdot {dt}&lt;/math&gt;

And if the angular speed is constant then {{math|W}} is also constant and the equation can be integrated. The result is:

:: &lt;math&gt;A(t) = e^{W \cdot t}A(0)&lt;/math&gt;

which shows a connection with the [[Lie group]] of rotations.

==== W is skew-symmetric ====
It is possible to prove that angular velocity tensor are [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew symmetric matrices]] which means that a &lt;math&gt;W = \frac {dR(t)}{dt}\cdot {R^T} &lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;W^T= -W&lt;/math&gt;.

To prove it we start taking the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}^T&lt;/math&gt; being R(t) a rotation matrix:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}^T&lt;/math&gt; because R(t) is a rotation matrix
: &lt;math&gt;0=\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^T+\mathcal{R}\frac{d\mathcal{R}^T}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the formula ('''AB''')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = '''B'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^T+\left(\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^T\right)^T = W + W^T&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, ''W'' is the negative of its transpose, which implies it is a skew symmetric matrix.

==== Duality with respect to the velocity vector ====
The tensor is a matrix with this structure:

: &lt;math&gt;

W(t) =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -\omega_z(t) &amp; \omega_y(t) \\
\omega_z(t) &amp; 0 &amp; -\omega_x(t) \\
-\omega_y(t) &amp; \omega_x(t) &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

As it is a [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew symmetric matrix]] it has a [[Hodge dual|Hodge dual vector]] which is precisely the previous angular velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=[\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z]&lt;/math&gt;

=== Coordinate-free description ===
At any instant, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the angular velocity tensor represents a linear map between the position vectors  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r}(t) &lt;/math&gt;
and their velocity vectors &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}(t) &lt;/math&gt; of a rigid body rotating around the origin:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = W\mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt;

where we omitted the &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; parameter, and regard &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt; as elements of the same 3-dimensional [[Euclidean vector space]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

The relation between this linear map and the angular velocity [[pseudovector]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the following.

Because of ''W'' is the derivative of an [[orthogonal transformation]], the

: &lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{s}) = (W\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{s} &lt;/math&gt;

[[bilinear form]] is [[skew-symmetric]]{{disambiguation needed|date=November 2014}}. (Here &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; stands for the [[scalar product]]). So we can apply the fact of [[exterior algebra]] that there is a unique [[linear form]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^2  V &lt;/math&gt; that

: &lt;math&gt;L(\mathbf{r}\wedge \mathbf{s}) = B(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{s})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\wedge \mathbf{s} \in \Lambda^2  V  &lt;/math&gt;  is the [[wedge product]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking the [[dual vector]] ''L''* of ''L'' we get

: &lt;math&gt; (W\mathbf{r})\cdot \mathbf{s} =  L^* \cdot (\mathbf{r}\wedge \mathbf{s}) &lt;/math&gt;

Introducing &lt;math&gt; \omega := *L^* &lt;/math&gt;, as the [[Hodge dual]] of ''L''*, and apply further Hodge dual identities we arrive at

: &lt;math&gt; (W\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{s}  = * ( *L^* \wedge \mathbf{r} \wedge \mathbf{s})  = * (\omega \wedge \mathbf{r} \wedge \mathbf{s}) =  *(\omega \wedge \mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{s} = (\omega \times \mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{s}  &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\omega \times \mathbf{r} := *(\omega \wedge \mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;

by definition.

Because &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;  is an arbitrary vector, from nondegeneracy of [[scalar product]] follows

: &lt;math&gt; W\mathbf{r} = \omega \times \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Angular velocity as a vector field ===
For angular velocity tensor maps velocities to positions, it is a [[vector field]]. In particular, this vector field is a [[Killing vector field]] belonging to an element of the [[Lie algebra]] so(3) of the 3-dimensional [[rotation group SO(3)]]. This element of so(3) can also be regarded as the angular velocity vector.

== Rigid body considerations ==
{{see also|axes conventions}}

[[Image:AngularVelocity02.svg|right|320 px|thumb|Position of point P located in the rigid body (shown in blue). '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the position with respect to the lab frame, centered at ''O''&amp;nbsp; and '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the position with respect to the rigid body frame, centered at ''O' ''&amp;nbsp;. The origin of the rigid body frame is at vector position '''R''' from the lab frame.]]

The same equations for the angular speed can be obtained reasoning over a rotating [[rigid body]]. Here is not assumed that the rigid body rotates around the origin. Instead it can be supposed rotating around an arbitrary point which is moving with a linear velocity V(t) in each instant.

To obtain the equations it is convenient to imagine a rigid body attached to the frames and consider a coordinate system that is fixed with respect to the rigid body. Then we will study the coordinate transformations between this coordinate and the fixed &quot;laboratory&quot; system.

As shown in the figure on the right, the lab system's origin is at point O, the rigid body system origin is at O' and the vector from O to O' is '''R'''. A particle (''i'') in the rigid body is located at point P and the vector position of this particle is '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in the lab frame, and at position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in the body frame. It is seen that the position of the particle can be written:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_i=\mathbf{R}+\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt;

The defining characteristic of a rigid body is that the distance between any two points in a rigid body is unchanging in time. This means that the length of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; is unchanging. By [[Euler's rotation theorem]], we may replace the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a 3x3 [[rotation matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the particle at some fixed point in time, say t=0. This replacement is useful, because now it is only the rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; which is changing in time and not the reference vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;, as the rigid body rotates about point O'. Also, since the three columns of the rotation matrix represent the three [[versor]]s of a reference frame rotating together with the rigid body, any rotation about any axis becomes now visible, while the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; would not rotate if the rotation axis were parallel to it, and hence it would only describe a rotation about an axis perpendicular to it (i.e., it would not see the component of the angular velocity pseudovector parallel to it, and would only allow the computation of the component perpendicular to it). The position of the particle is now written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_i=\mathbf{R}+\mathcal{R}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the time derivative yields the velocity of the particle:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i=\mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the velocity of the particle (in the lab frame) and '''V''' is the velocity of O' (the origin of the rigid body frame).  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a rotation matrix its inverse is its transpose.  So we substitute &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{R}^T\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{I}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^T\mathcal{R}\mathbf{r}_{io}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+\frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^T\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \mathbf{V}+W\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W = \frac{d\mathcal{R}}{dt}\mathcal{R}^T&lt;/math&gt; is the previous [[angular velocity tensor]].

It can be [[#W is skew-symmetric|proved]] that this is a [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew symmetric matrix]], so we can take its [[dual space|dual]] to get a 3 dimensional pseudovector which is precisely the previous angular velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega=[\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z]&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting ω for ''W'' into the above velocity expression, and replacing matrix multiplication by an equivalent cross product:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i=\mathbf{V}+\boldsymbol\omega\times\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that the velocity of a point in a rigid body can be divided into two terms – the velocity of a reference point fixed in the rigid body plus the cross product term involving the angular velocity of the particle with respect to the reference point. This angular velocity is the &quot;spin&quot; angular velocity of the rigid body as opposed to the angular velocity of the reference point O' about the origin O.

=== Consistency ===
We have supposed that the rigid body rotates around an arbitrary point. We should prove that the angular velocity previously defined is independent from the choice of origin, which means that the angular velocity is an intrinsic property of the spinning rigid body.

[[image:AngularVelocity03.svg|right| 320 px| thumb| Proving the independence of angular velocity from choice of origin]]

See the graph to the right: The origin of lab frame is O, while O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two fixed points on the rigid body, whose velocity is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Suppose the angular velocity with respect to O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Since point P and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have only one velocity,

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}_1 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_1\times\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{v}_2 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_2\times\mathbf{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{v}_1 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_1\times\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{v}_1 + \boldsymbol{\omega}_1\times (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2) &lt;/math&gt;

The above two yields that

: &lt;math&gt; (\boldsymbol{\omega}_1-\boldsymbol{\omega}_2) \times \mathbf{r}_2=0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since the point P (and thus &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt;) is arbitrary, it follows that

: &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega}_1 = \boldsymbol{\omega}_2 &lt;/math&gt;

If the reference point is the [[instantaneous axis of rotation]] the expression of velocity of a point in the rigid body will have just the angular velocity term. This is because the velocity of instantaneous axis of rotation is zero. An example of instantaneous axis of rotation is the hinge of a door. Another example is the point of contact of a purely rolling spherical (or, more generally, convex) rigid body.

==Angular velocity symbol==
When preparing electronic documents, some document editing software will attempt to use the Symbol typeface to render the ω character. Where the font is not supported, a w is displayed instead (&quot;v=rw&quot; instead of &quot;v=rω&quot;, for instance). As w represents weight, not angular velocity, this can lead to confusion.

The '''Tonti diagram''',&lt;ref&gt;Tonti, E.: The Mathematical Structure of Classical and Relativistic Physics, Birkhäuser (Springer) (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; created by the Italian physicist and mathematician Enzo Tonti, is a diagram that classifies variables and equations of physical theories of classical and relativistic physics. The theories involved are: ''particle dynamics, analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids, fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, gravitation, heat conduction,'' and ''irreversible thermodynamics''. The classification stems from the observation that each physical variable has a well-defined association with a space and a time element, as shown in Fig. 1, which can be grasped from the corresponding global variable and from its measuring process.

== Historical note ==
The starting point of this classification stems from a remark by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]. Speaking about analogies in different physical theories, Maxwell wrote in 1871:&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C.: Remarks on the Mathematical Classification of Physical Quantities. Proc.
London Math. Soc. 3 (34), 258-266 (1871) Reprinted by Niven, W.D.: The Scientific Papers of J.C. Maxwell. Dover, New York (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the factors which compose it [energy], one is referred to unit of length, and the other to unit of area. This gives what I regard as a very important distinction among vector quantities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This remark leads us to a distinction between vectors referred to lines and vectors referred to surfaces. This is not customarily considered in vector calculus or in physics. In electromagnetism, hence, vectors '''E''' and '''H''' are associated with lines, and vectors '''D''' and '''B''' are associated with surfaces. This distinction leads to a classification of physical variables based on their ''association'' with space elements. 
Maxwell continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is only through the progress of science in recent times that we have become acquainted with so large a number of physical quantities that a classification of them is desirable. [...] But the classification which I now refer to is founded on the mathematical or formal analogy of the different quantities, and not on the matter to which they belong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The classification diagram arises from an analysis of the ''association'' of physical variables in different physical theories, whatever their mathematical nature, i.e. scalars, vectors, tensors, etc., with space and time elements.

== The three kinds of physical quantities ==
Physics, compared to other natural sciences, has the great privilege of considering the [[quantity|quantitative]] attributes of physical systems and from these originate the [[physical quantity|physical quantities]], which can be [[scalar (physics)|scalars]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, [[tensor]]s, etc. Physical quantities can be divided into three main categories: '''physical variables''', '''physical parameters''' and [[physical constant|'''fundamental constants''']].

== Global variables in space and field variables ==
The term '''space-global variables''' refers to all physical variables that are not densities of other variables. Distinguishing  between global variables and corresponding densities is essential. Mass density is given by the ratio of mass to volume, mass being the ''global'' variable. Pressure is the ratio of the normal force on an element of plane surface to the surface area, therefore the normal force is the ''global'' variable and the pressure is its surface density. The strain of a bar is the ratio of the elongation to its original length, elongation being the ''global'' variable and strain the line density.
The very fact that we create volume, surface or line densities highlights that the corresponding global variables are ''associated'' with volumes, surfaces and lines.
Every density is obtained by dividing a global variable by the extension of the ''associated'' space element. The mathematical treatment of physics also customarily considers the limit of this ratio to obtain a pointwise density, i.e. a '''field variable'''. Generally, field variables are preferred to global variables, to the extent that we express the global variables as integrals of the respective field variables, and call them '''integral variables'''.
Integral variables are global variables, but there are also global variables which are ''associated'' with points, and which, therefore, cannot be considered integral variables. Hence, global variables form a broader class compared to integral variables; for which reason, in view of the classification, the use of the term “global variables” is preferred to that of &quot;integral variables&quot;.

== Global variables in time and rates ==
The term '''time-global variables''' is used to indicate variables that are not rates of other variables. Displacement, impulse, momentum and position vector are therefore global variables. Displacement and impulse are associated with time intervals, while momentum and position vector are associated with instants. This is evident if we think that we can perform the rates of the first two variables obtaining velocity and force respectively, while we cannot perform the rates of the last two variables.

== The three kinds of physical variables ==
The physical variables, both global variables and densities, in turn, can be divided into three classes: those characterising the ''configuration'' of a system or a field, those describing the ''source'' of a phenomenon or a field, and finally ''energy'' variables. Every physical system, even a field, has its own “configuration”, and the variables describing this configuration are called '''configuration variables'''. Each field has its sources (for example, electric charges are the source of electric fields, heat generators are the source of thermal fields and forces are the source of motion and deformation): variables describing sources are called '''source variables'''. The third category, that of '''energy variables''', is created by multiplying a configuration variable by a source variable.
The '''fundamental problem''' of a field is finding the configuration of the field at every time instant, given the spatial distribution and the intensity of its sources (which is to say: given the causes, determine the effects).

== Space and time elements ==
By the term &quot;space elements&quot; we intend '''points''', '''lines''', '''surfaces''' and '''volumes''', which are denoted '''P''','''L''','''S''' and '''V''' respectively.
By the term &quot;time elements&quot; we intend '''time instants''' and '''time intervals''', which are denoted '''I''' and '''T''' respectively.
Space elements are naturally classified according to their dimension, from the smallest to the biggest, i.e. points, lines, surfaces and volumes. The same classification applies to time elements, i.e. instants and intervals.

== Association with space elements ==
[[File:Schermata49.png|thumb | '''Figure 1'''.The figure shows a number of physical variables with the space and time elements they are ''associated'' with.]]

[[File:Margheritaq.png|thumb | '''Figure 2'''. Every space element can be endowed with one of the two possible orientations: inner and outer.]]

All fluxes (e.g. magnetic flux, electric flux, vortex flux)  make reference to a surface ('''S'''), all variables expressed by a line integral (e.g. electromotive force, velocity circulation, magnetomotive force) make reference to a line ('''L''') and all contents (e.g. of energy, mass, entropy, etc.) make reference to a volume ('''V'''). Lastly all potentials (e.g. electric potential, velocity potential, temperature) make reference to a point ('''P''').

== Association with time elements ==
A similar association exists between time-global variables and time elements. Therefore, a displacement is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''), whereas a position vector is ''associated'' with a time instant ('''I'''). In this association the measuring process must be taken into account, because temperature is ''referred'' to an instant but its measurement involves a time interval - the one needed to reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the temperature is said to be ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''). Similarly, the measurement of a force requires a mechanical equilibrium to be reached, hence it is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T''').

[[File:Ritaaa.png|thumb | '''Figure 3'''. ''Left'') A two-dimensional cell complex and its dual; ''right'') the classification of its space elements.]]

== Inherited association of field variables ==
Since in each field of physics the global variables are ''associated'' with a space and a time element, the association of the corresponding densities and the rates with the space and time element of the corresponding global variable is spontaneous. The densities and the rates are said to ''inherit'' the association from their corresponding global variables. The same inherited association remains once we have  performed the limit to obtain the field variables.

== Orientation of space elements ==
In this classification, the orientation of the space elements has a fundamental role. There are two kinds of orientation: '''inner''' and '''outer orientation''',&lt;ref&gt;Schouten, J.A.: Tensor Calculus for Physicists. 2nd ed., Dover, New York (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in Fig. 2.

There is a surprising correspondence between the role that a physical variable plays in a theory and the type of orientation of the corresponding space element: a detailed analysis of physical variables shows that ''the configuration variables are associated with the space elements endowed with inner orientation while the source and the energy variables are associated with the outer orientation.''

[[File:Greta copia.png|thumb | '''Figure 4'''. ''Left'') A three-dimensional cell complex and its dual; ''right'') the classification of its space elements.]]

== Cell complexes ==
To highlight the four space elements, it is expedient to divide a region of space into many cells, thus creating a '''cell complex'''. The vertices represent points, the edges lines, the faces surfaces and the cells themselves volumes.
Each of these elements can be given an inner orientation. Since we also need space elements with outer orientation, it is expedient to consider the '''dual complex''', obtained by joining the centroids of the cells belonging to the '''primal complex'''. Doing so, we see that the inner orientation of each element of the primal complex induces an outer orientation on the corresponding element of the dual complex.

Figures 3 and 4 show how the space elements of the primal complex, which are endowed with inner orientation, induce an outer orientation on the elements of the dual complex. Moreover, the space elements of the two complexes can be arranged in a diagram such as the one shown on the right-hand side of the figures.

A cell complex and its dual constitute a valid framework to describe the association of physical variables with the oriented space elements. To be precise, the configuration variables, which are associated with space elements with inner orientation, may be associated with the elements of the primal complex, while the source variables, which are associated with the space elements with an outer orientation, can be associated with the elements of the dual complex.

== Orientation of time elements ==

[[File:Tempo nuovo 2.png|thumb | '''Figure 5'''. Time elements. I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time instants; T&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time intervals; '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = position vector; '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = displacement.]]

At first glance, the notions of inner and outer orientation of a time element may appear strange, certainly unusual. Let us consider a subdivision of the time axis into many adjacent time intervals. Doing so, we have constructed a one-dimensional cell complex in time. 
Considering now the middle instants of each time interval we have a second cell complex in time. The first complex is called ''primal'' and the second ''dual''.
 
'''Primal complex, inner orientation''': the fact that the time axis is oriented implies that each time interval is oriented: this is the inner orientation of the primal time intervals.
Since the variation of a time function φ (t) is defined as Δφ = + φ (t + h)-φ (t),  in order to conceive the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; signs of this formula as incidence numbers between a time interval and its bounding instants, these should be considered as &quot;sinks&quot;.

'''Dual complex, outer orientation''': the middle instant of each time interval is called ''dual time instant'' and we can give it the same orientation of the primal time interval. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time instant. In turn, the time intervals connecting two adjacent dual time instants are called ''dual time intervals''. Once more we can assign them the orientation induced by the primal time instants, as shown in Fig. 5. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time intervals.

[[File:Ele1.png|thumb | '''Figure 6'''. Classification diagram for electrostatics.]]

The fact that physical variables are associated with space and time elements endowed with inner or outer orientation and that space and time elements of a primal and a dual cell complex can be classified as shown on the right-hand side of Figs. 3 and 4, suggests a corresponding classification of physical variables. 
Let us consider, as an example, the classification diagram of electrostatics, shown in Fig. 6. The left column includes those physical variables associated with the primal cell complex, whose elements are endowed with inner orientation: these are the ''configuration'' variables. The right column includes those physical variables associated with the dual cell complex, whose elements are endowed with outer orientation: these are the ''source'' variables.

The equations linking the variables are contained in the rectangular boxes. The equations in each vertical column are ''balance'' equations, ''circuital'' equations and ''gradient-forming'' equations. They have a topological structure and are called '''topological equations'''. Those that link configuration variables to source variables—contained in the horizontal links—are ''material'' or ''constitutive'' equations, and belong to the category of '''phenomenological equations'''.

==The time diagram==
[[File:Par1.png|thumb | '''Figure 7'''. Classification diagram for particle dynamics.]]
Particle dynamics, analytical mechanics and electric networks make use of space-global variables that depend only on the time variable. Referring here to particle dynamics, we see that configuration variables are geometrical and kinematic variables, while source variables are static and dynamic variables. In Fig. 7 we see that kinematic variables lie in the left column while dynamic variables lie in the right one. The diagram shows three phenomenological equations: those connecting two variables on the same level describe a reversible relation (i.e. a non-dissipative relation), while those linking force with velocity describe an irreversible relation (i.e. a dissipative relation). The dissipative nature is shown by the fact that one variable, velocity, changes sign under reversal of motion, while the other, force, does not.

==The space-time diagram==
[[File:E Tonti Classification diagrams mechanical and field theories.png|thumb | '''Figure 8'''. The two classification diagrams of space-time elements.]] 
Since every global physical variable is associated with both a time and a space element, it appears useful to have a classification diagram combining space and time elements.   
When the four space elements '''P''', '''L''', '''S''' and '''V''' are coupled with the two time elements  '''I''' and '''T''' we obtain eight possible combinations. Furthermore, if one considers that each space element and each time element can be endowed with two orientations, inner and outer, we must combine the 4x2 oriented space elements with the 2x2 oriented time elements, thus obtaining 32 possible space-time combinations. Fig. 8 shows the two possible classification diagrams of the space-time elements.
The first version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with inner orientation and vice versa: it is the case of mechanics in all its manifestations, such as particle and analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids and fluid mechanics. The second version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with outer orientation and vice versa. It is the case of field theories such as electromagnetism, gravitation, thermal conduction and irreversible thermodynamics.

The space-time diagrams show clearly which phenomenological equations describe irreversible phenomena: they are the ones that link variables that are on the same level but connect a box on the front-left side with a box on the back-right side.

'''Electrical resistivity''' (also known as '''resistivity''', '''specific electrical resistance''', or '''volume resistivity''') is an intrinsic property that quantifies how strongly a given material opposes the flow of [[electric current]]. A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows the flow of [[electric current]]. Resistivity is commonly represented by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] ρ ([[Rho (letter)|rho]]). The [[SI]] unit of electrical resistivity is the [[ohm]]⋅[[metre]] (Ω⋅m)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lowrie |title=Fundamentals of Geophysics |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h2-NjUg4RtEC&amp;pg=PA254 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-46595-3 |pages=254–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Narinder Kumar |title=Comprehensive Physics XII |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IryMtwHHngIC&amp;pg=PA282 |year=2003 |publisher=Laxmi Publications |isbn=978-81-7008-592-8 |pages=282–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Bogatin |title=Signal Integrity: Simplified |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_IiONSphoB4C&amp;pg=PA114 |year=2004 |publisher=Prentice Hall Professional |isbn=978-0-13-066946-9 |pages=114–}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other units like [[ohm]]⋅[[centimetre]] (Ω⋅cm) are also in use.  As an example, if a {{nowrap|1 m × 1 m × 1 m}} solid cube of material has sheet contacts on two opposite faces, and the resistance between these contacts is 1&amp;nbsp;Ω, then the resistivity of the material is 1&amp;nbsp;Ω⋅m.

'''Electrical conductivity''' or '''specific conductance''' is the reciprocal of electrical resistivity, and measures a material's ability to conduct an [[electric current]]. It is commonly represented by the Greek letter σ ([[Sigma (letter)|sigma]]), but κ ([[kappa]]) (especially in electrical engineering) or γ ([[gamma]]) are also occasionally used. Its SI unit is [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per [[metre]] (S/m) and [[Electrostatic units|CGSE unit]] is reciprocal [[second]] (s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

Another related quantity, widely used in the literature of plasma physics, is the [[magnetic diffusivity]] defined as &lt;math&gt; \eta=\rho/\mu_0\equiv 1/\sigma \mu_0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic permeability]]. The unit of the magnetic diffusivity, in [[SI]], is &lt;math&gt;mA^2 \Omega N^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==

=== Resistors or conductors with uniform cross-section ===
[[Image:Resistivity geometry.png|thumb|A piece of resistive material with electrical contacts on both ends.]]
Many [[resistor]]s and [[electrical conductor|conductors]] have a uniform cross section with a uniform flow of electric current, and are made of one material. (See the diagram to the right.) In this case, the electrical resistivity ''ρ'' (Greek: [[Rho (letter)|rho]]) is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = R \frac{A}{\ell}, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''R'' is the [[electrical resistance]] of a uniform specimen of the material (measured in [[ohm]]s, Ω)
:''&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[length]] of the piece of material (measured in [[metre]]s, m)
:''A'' is the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]] of the specimen (measured in [[Square metre|square metres]], m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The reason resistivity is defined this way is that it makes resistivity an ''[[intrinsic property]]'', unlike [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]]. All copper wires, irrespective of their shape and size, have approximately the same ''resistivity'', but a long, thin copper wire has a much larger ''resistance'' than a thick, short copper wire. Every material has its own characteristic resistivity – for example, resistivity of rubber is far larger than copper's.

In a [[hydraulic analogy]], passing current through a high-resistivity material is like pushing water through a pipe full of sand—while passing current through a low-resistivity material is like pushing water through an empty pipe. If the pipes are the same size and shape, the pipe full of sand has higher resistance to flow. Resistance, however, is not ''solely'' determined by the presence or absence of sand. It also depends on the length and width of the pipe: short or wide pipes have lower resistance than narrow or long pipes.

The above equation can be transposed to get '''Pouillet's law''' (named after [[Claude Pouillet]]):

:&lt;math&gt;R = \rho \frac{\ell}{A}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The resistance of a given material increases with length, but decreases with increasing cross-sectional area. From the above equations, resistivity has [[SI]] units of [[ohm]]⋅[[metre]]. Other units like ohm⋅cm or ohm⋅inch are also sometimes used.

The formula &lt;math&gt;R = \rho \ell / A&lt;/math&gt; can be used to intuitively understand the meaning of a resistivity value. For example, if &lt;math&gt;A=1\text{m}^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell=1\text{m}&lt;/math&gt; (forming a cube with perfectly conductive contacts on opposite faces), then the resistance of this element in ohms is numerically equal to the resistivity of the material it is made of in ohm-meters. Likewise, a 1 ohm⋅cm material would have a resistance of 1 ohm if contacted on opposite faces of a 1&amp;nbsp;cm×1&amp;nbsp;cm×1&amp;nbsp;cm cube.

Conductivity  ''σ'' (Greek: [[Sigma (letter)|sigma]]) is defined as the inverse of resistivity:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Conductivity has SI units of [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per meter (S/m).

=== General definition ===
The above definition was specific to resistors or conductors with a uniform cross-section, where current flows uniformly through them. A more basic and general definition starts from the fact that an [[electric field]] inside a material makes [[electric current]] flow. The electrical resistivity ''ρ'' is defined as the ratio of the electric field to the density of the current it creates:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{E}{J}, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''ρ'' is the resistivity of the conductor material (measured in ohm⋅metres, Ω⋅m),
:''E'' is the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the [[electric field]] (in [[volt]]s per [[metre]], V⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;),
:''J'' is the magnitude of the [[current density]] (in [[ampere]]s per [[square metre]], A⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;),

in which ''E'' and ''J'' are inside the conductor.

Conductivity is the inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho} = \frac{J}{E}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For example, rubber is a material with large ''ρ'' and small ''σ''—because even a very large electric field in rubber makes almost no current flow through it. On the other hand, copper is a material with small ''ρ'' and large ''σ''—because even a small electric field pulls a lot of current through it.

==Causes of conductivity==

===Band theory simplified===

{{see also|Band theory}}
{{Band structure filling diagram}}

[[Quantum mechanics]] states that electrons in an atom cannot take on any arbitrary energy value. Rather, the electrons must occupy fixed energy levels, and values between these levels are impossible. When a large number of such allowed energy levels are spaced close together (in energy-space)—i.e., have similar (minutely differing)—energies, we can talk about these energy levels together as an &quot;energy band.&quot; There can be many such energy bands in a material, depending on the atomic number {number of electrons (if atom is neutral)} and their distribution (besides external factors like environmental modification of the energy bands).

The material's electrons seek to minimize the total energy in the material by going to low energy states; however, the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] means that they cannot all go to the lowest state. The electrons instead &quot;fill up&quot; the band structure starting from the bottom. The characteristic energy level up to which the electrons have filled is called the [[Fermi level]]. The position of the Fermi level with respect to the band structure is very important for electrical conduction: only electrons in energy levels near the [[Fermi level]] are free to move around since the electrons can easily jump among the partially occupied states in that region. In contrast, the low energy states are rigidly filled with a fixed number of electrons at all times, and the high energy states are empty of electrons at all times.

In metals there are many energy levels near the Fermi level, meaning that there are many electrons available to move. This is what causes the high electronic conductivity in metals.

An important part of band theory is that there may be forbidden bands in energy: energy intervals that contain no energy levels. In insulators and semiconductors, the number of electrons happens to be just the right amount to fill a certain integer number of low energy bands, exactly to the boundary. In this case, the Fermi level falls within a band gap. Since there are no available states near the Fermi level, and the electrons are not freely movable, the electronic conductivity is very low.

===In metals===
[[Image:Newtons cradle animation book 2.gif|right|200px|thumb|Like balls in a [[Newton's cradle]], electrons in a metal quickly transfer energy from one terminal to another, despite their own negligible movement.]]
A [[metal]] consists of a [[Crystal lattice|lattice]] of [[atom]]s, each with an outer shell of electrons that freely dissociate from their parent atoms and travel through the lattice. This is also known as a positive ionic lattice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20120416024619/http://ibchem.com/IB/ibnotes/brief/bon-sl.htm Bonding (sl)]. ibchem.com&lt;/ref&gt; This 'sea' of dissociable electrons allows the metal to conduct electric current. When an electrical potential difference (a [[voltage]]) is applied across the metal, the resulting [[electric field]] causes electrons to drift towards the positive terminal. The actual [[drift velocity]] of electrons is very small, in the order of magnitude of a meter per hour. However, as the electrons are densely packed in the material, the electromagnetic field is [[Speed of electricity|propagated]] through the metal at the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref name=classroom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circuits/u9l2c.cfm#p6 |title=Current versus Drift Speed |publisher=The physics classroom |accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism is similar to transfer of momentum of balls in a [[Newton's cradle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/electronics-basics-direct-and-alternating-current.html |title=Electronics All-in-One For Dummies |last=Lowe |first=Doug |isbn=978-0-470-14704-7 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near [[room temperature]]s, metals have resistance. The primary cause of this resistance is the collision of electrons with the atoms that make up the crystal lattice. This acts to scatter electrons and lose their energy on collisions rather than on linear movement through the lattice. Also contributing to resistance in metals with impurities are the resulting imperfections in the lattice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/circuits/u9l3b.cfm |title=Current Electricity - Lesson 3 - Electrical Resistance|publisher=The physics classroom |accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger the cross-sectional area of the conductor, the more electrons per unit length are available to carry the current. As a result, the resistance is lower in larger cross-section conductors. The number of scattering events encountered by an electron passing through a material is proportional to the length of the conductor. The longer the conductor, therefore, the higher the resistance. Different materials also affect the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Suresh V Vettoor [http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Sept2003/pdf/Sept2003p41-48.pdf Electrical Conduction and Superconductivity]. ias.ac.in.

===In semiconductors and insulators===
{{main|Semiconductor|Insulator (electricity)}}
In metals, the [[Fermi level]] lies in the conduction band (see Band Theory, above) giving rise to free conduction electrons. However, in [[semiconductors]] the position of the Fermi level is within the band gap, approximately half-way between the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum for intrinsic (undoped) semiconductors. This means that at 0 kelvin, there are no free conduction electrons, and the resistance is infinite. However, the resistance continues to decrease as the charge carrier density in the conduction band increases. In extrinsic (doped) semiconductors, [[dopant]] atoms increase the majority charge carrier concentration by donating electrons to the conduction band or accepting holes in the valence band. For both types of donor or acceptor atoms, increasing dopant density reduces resistance. Hence, highly doped semiconductors behave metallically. At very high temperatures, the contribution of thermally generated carriers dominate over the contribution from dopant atoms, and the resistance decreases exponentially with temperature.

===In ionic liquids/electrolytes===
{{main|Conductivity (electrolytic)}}
In [[electrolyte]]s, electrical conduction happens not by band electrons or holes, but by full atomic species ([[ion]]s) traveling, each carrying an electrical charge. The resistivity of ionic liquids varies tremendously by the concentration – while distilled water is almost an insulator, [[Saline water|salt water]] is a very efficient electrical conductor. In [[cell membrane|biological membranes]], currents are carried by ionic salts. Small holes in the membranes, called [[ion channel]]s, are selective to specific ions and determine the membrane resistance.

===Superconductivity===
{{main|Superconductivity}}
The electrical resistivity of a metallic [[electrical conductor|conductor]] decreases gradually as temperature is lowered. In ordinary [[Electrical conductor|conductors]], such as [[copper]] or [[silver]], this decrease is limited by impurities and other defects. Even near [[absolute zero]], a real sample of a normal conductor shows some resistance. In a superconductor, the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature. An [[electric current]] flowing in a loop of [[superconducting wire]] can persist indefinitely with no power source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallop&quot;&gt;

In 1986, researchers discovered that some [[cuprate]]-[[perovskite (structure)|perovskite]] [[ceramic]] materials have a critical temperature above {{convert|90|K|°C|abbr=on|0}}.{{Reference needed|date=March 2015}} Such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a [[conventional superconductor]], so the researchers named these conductors ''[[high-temperature superconductors]]''. [[Liquid nitrogen]] boils at 77&amp;nbsp;K, facilitating many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures. In conventional superconductors, electrons are held together in pairs by an attraction mediated by lattice [[phonon]]s. The best available model of high-temperature superconductivity is still somewhat crude. There is a hypothesis that electron pairing in high-temperature superconductors is mediated by short-range spin waves known as paramagnons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Plasma===
{{main|Plasma (physics)}}
[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania 3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Lightning]]
is an example of plasma present at Earth's surface.
Typically, lightning discharges 30,000 amperes at up to 100 million volts, and emits light, radio waves, X-rays and even gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning]&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma temperatures in lightning can approach 28,000 Kelvin (28,000&amp;nbsp;°C) (50,000&amp;nbsp;°F) and electron densities may exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.]]

Plasmas are very good [[electrical conductor]]s and electric potentials play an important role.
The potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles, independent of the question of how it can be measured, is called the ''plasma potential'', or ''space potential''. If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential generally lies considerably below the plasma potential, due to what is termed a [[Debye sheath]]. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of ''quasineutrality'', which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;Z&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), but on the scale of the [[Debye length]] there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that ''[[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]]'' are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.

The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net [[charge density]]. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the [[Boltzmann relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;n_e \propto e^{e\Phi/k_BT_e}.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = -(k_BT_e/e)(\nabla n_e/n_e).&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small. Otherwise, the repulsive [[electrostatic force]] dissipates it.

In [[astrophysical]] plasmas, [[electric field screening|Debye screening]] prevents [[electric field]]s from directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the [[Debye length]]. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, [[magnetic field]]s. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of [[Debye length]]s. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated [[magnetic field]]s are studied in the [[academic discipline]] of [[magnetohydrodynamics]].

Plasma is often called the ''fourth state of matter'' after solid, liquids and gases.&lt;ref&gt;Yaffa Eliezer, Shalom Eliezer, ''The Fourth State of Matter: An Introduction to the Physics of Plasma'', Publisher: Adam Hilger, 1989, ISBN 978-0-85274-164-1, 226 pages, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bittencourt, J.A.|title=Fundamentals of Plasma Physics|publisher=Springer|year=2004|isbn=9780387209753|page=1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qCA64ys-5bUC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from these and other lower-energy [[states of matter]]. Although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no definite form or volume, it differs in a number of ways, including the following:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Property !! Gas !! Plasma
|-
! Electrical conductivity
| '''Very low''': Air is an excellent insulator until it breaks down into plasma at electric field strengths above 30 kilovolts per centimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/AliceHong.shtml|title=Dielectric Strength of Air|year=2000|first=Alice|last=Hong|work=The Physics Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| '''Usually very high''': For many purposes, the conductivity of a plasma may be treated as infinite.
|-
! Independently acting species
| '''One''': All gas particles behave in a similar way, influenced by [[gravity]] and by [[collision]]s with one another.
| '''Two or three''': [[Electron]]s, [[ion]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can be distinguished by the sign and value of their [[electric charge|charge]] so that they behave independently in many circumstances, with different bulk velocities and temperatures, allowing phenomena such as new types of [[waves in plasma|waves]] and [[Instability|instabilities]].
|-
! Velocity distribution
| '''[[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]''': Collisions usually lead to a Maxwellian velocity distribution of all gas particles, with very few relatively fast particles.
| '''Often non-Maxwellian''': Collisional interactions are often weak in hot plasmas and external forcing can drive the plasma far from local equilibrium and lead to a significant population of unusually fast particles.
|-
! Interactions
| '''Binary''': Two-particle collisions are the rule, three-body collisions extremely rare.
| '''Collective''': Waves, or organized motion of plasma, are very important because the particles can interact at long ranges through the electric and magnetic forces.

==Resistivity and conductivity of various materials== &lt;!-- [[Supercapacitor]] links here --&gt;
{{Main|Electrical resistivities of the elements (data page)}}
* A [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] such as a [[metal]] has high conductivity and a low resistivity.
* An [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] like [[glass]] has low conductivity and a high resistivity.
* The conductivity of a [[semiconductor]] is generally intermediate, but varies widely under different conditions, such as exposure of the material to electric fields or specific frequencies of [[light]], and, most important, with [[temperature]] and composition of the semiconductor material.

The degree of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] in semiconductors makes a large difference in conductivity. To a point, more doping leads to higher conductivity. The conductivity of a [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]] of [[Water (molecule)|water]] is highly dependent on its [[concentration]] of dissolved [[salts]], and other chemical species that [[Ionization|ionize]] in the solution. Electrical conductivity of water samples is used as an indicator of how salt-free, ion-free, or impurity-free the sample is; the purer the water, the lower the conductivity (the higher the resistivity). Conductivity measurements in water are often reported as ''specific conductance'', relative to the conductivity of pure water at {{val|25|u=°C}}. An [[EC meter]] is normally used to measure conductivity in a solution. A rough summary is as follows:

The effective temperature coefficient varies with temperature and purity level of the material. The 20&amp;nbsp;°C value is only an approximation when used at other temperatures. For example, the coefficient becomes lower at higher temperatures for copper, and the value 0.00427 is commonly specified at {{val|0|u=°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.bldrdoc.gov/docs/nbshb100.pdf Copper Wire Tables]. US Dep. of Commerce. National Bureau of Standards Handbook. February 21, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

The extremely low resistivity (high conductivity) of silver is characteristic of metals. [[George Gamow]] tidily summed up the nature of the metals' dealings with electrons in his science-popularizing book, ''One, Two, Three...Infinity'' (1947): &quot;The metallic substances differ from all other materials by the fact that the outer shells of their atoms are bound rather loosely, and often let one of their electrons go free. Thus the interior of a metal is filled up with a large number of unattached electrons that travel aimlessly around like a crowd of displaced persons. When a metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus forming what we call an electric current.&quot; More technically, the [[free electron model]] gives a basic description of electron flow in metals.

Wood is widely regarded as an extremely good insulator, but its resistivity is sensitively dependent on moisture content, with damp wood being a factor of at least {{val|e=10}} worse insulator than oven-dry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transmission Lines data&quot;/&gt; In any case, a sufficiently high voltage – such as that in lightning strikes or some high-tension powerlines – can lead to insulation breakdown and electrocution risk even with apparently dry wood.

==Temperature dependence==

===Linear approximation===
The electrical resistivity of most materials changes with temperature. If the temperature ''T'' does not vary too much, a [[linear approximation]] is typically used:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(T) = \rho_0[1+\alpha (T - T_0)]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''temperature coefficient of resistivity'', &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; is the resistivity at temperature &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; was measured at with a suffix, such as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{15}&lt;/math&gt;, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference.&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Ward (1971) ''Electrical Engineering Science'', pp. 36–40, McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; When the temperature varies over a large temperature range, the [[linear approximation]] is inadequate and a more detailed analysis and understanding should be used.

===Metals===
In general, electrical resistivity of [[metal]]s increases with [[temperature]]. Electron–[[phonon]] interactions can play a key role. At high temperatures, the resistance of a metal increases linearly with temperature. As the temperature of a metal is reduced, the temperature dependence of resistivity follows a power law function of temperature. Mathematically the temperature dependence of the resistivity ρ of a metal is given by the Bloch–Grüneisen formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(T)=\rho(0)+A\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_R}\right)^n\int_0^{\frac{\Theta_R}{T}}\frac{x^n}{(e^x-1)(1-e^{-x})}dx&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the residual resistivity due to defect scattering, A is a constant that depends on the velocity of electrons at the [[Fermi surface]], the [[Debye radius]] and the number density of electrons in the metal. &lt;math&gt;\Theta_R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Debye temperature]] as obtained from resistivity measurements and matches very closely with the values of Debye temperature obtained from specific heat measurements. n is an integer that depends upon the nature of interaction:

# n=5 implies that the resistance is due to scattering of electrons by [[phonon]]s (as it is for simple metals)
# n=3 implies that the resistance is due to s-d electron scattering (as is the case for transition metals)
# n=2 implies that the resistance is due to electron–electron interaction.

If more than one source of scattering is simultaneously present, Matthiessen's Rule
(first formulated by [[Augustus Matthiessen]] in the 1860s)
&lt;ref&gt;A. Matthiessen, Rep. Brit. Ass. 32, 144 (1862)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Matthiessen, Progg. Anallen, 122, 47 (1864)&lt;/ref&gt; says that the total resistance can be approximated by adding up several different terms, each with the appropriate value of ''n''.

As the temperature of the metal is sufficiently reduced (so as to 'freeze' all the phonons), the resistivity usually reaches a
constant value, known as the '''residual resistivity'''. This value depends not only on the type of metal, but on its purity and thermal history. The value of the residual resistivity of a metal is decided by its impurity concentration. Some materials lose all electrical resistivity at sufficiently low temperatures, due to an effect known as [[superconductivity]].

An investigation of the low-temperature resistivity of metals was the motivation to [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes|Heike Kamerlingh Onnes's]] experiments that led in 1911 to discovery of [[superconductivity]]. For details see [[History of superconductivity]].

===Semiconductors===
{{main|Semiconductor}}
In general, [[intrinsic semiconductor]] resistivity decreases with increasing temperature. The electrons are bumped to the [[conduction band|conduction energy band]] by thermal energy, where they flow freely, and in doing so leave behind [[Electron hole|holes]] in the [[valence band]], which also flow freely. The electric resistance of a typical [[intrinsic semiconductor|intrinsic]] (non doped) [[semiconductor]] decreases [[exponential decay|exponentially]] with temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho= \rho_0 e^{-aT}\,&lt;/math&gt;

An even better approximation of the temperature dependence of the resistivity of a semiconductor is given by the [[Steinhart–Hart equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;1/T = A + B \ln(\rho) + C (\ln(\rho))^3 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are the so-called '''Steinhart–Hart coefficients'''.

This equation is used to calibrate [[thermistor]]s.

[[Extrinsic semiconductor|Extrinsic (doped) semiconductors]] have a far more complicated temperature profile. As temperature increases starting from absolute zero they first decrease steeply in resistance as the carriers leave the donors or acceptors. After most of the donors or acceptors have lost their carriers the resistance starts to increase again slightly due to the reducing mobility of carriers (much as in a metal). At higher temperatures it behaves like intrinsic semiconductors as the carriers from the donors/acceptors become insignificant compared to the thermally generated carriers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Seymour (1972)  ''Physical Electronics'', chapter 2, Pitman&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-crystalline semiconductors, conduction can occur by charges [[quantum tunnelling]] from one localised site to another. This is known as [[variable range hopping]] and has the characteristic form of
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = A\exp(T^{-1/n})&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''n'' = 2, 3, 4, depending on the dimensionality of the system.

==Complex resistivity and conductivity==
When analyzing the response of materials to alternating [[electric field]]s ([[dielectric spectroscopy]]), in applications such as [[electrical impedance tomography]],&lt;ref&gt;Otto H. Schmitt, University of Minnesota [http://web.archive.org/web/20101013215436/http://www.otto-schmitt.org/OttoPagesFinalForm/Sounds/Speeches/MutualImpedivity.htm Mutual Impedivity Spectrometry and the Feasibility of its Incorporation into Tissue-Diagnostic Anatomical Reconstruction and Multivariate Time-Coherent Physiological Measurements]. otto-schmitt.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt; it is convenient to replace resistivity with a [[complex number|complex]] quantity called '''impeditivity''' (in analogy to [[electrical impedance]]). Impeditivity is the sum of a real component, the resistivity, and an imaginary component, the '''reactivity''' (in analogy to [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]]). The magnitude of impeditivity is the square root of sum of squares of magnitudes of resistivity and reactivity.

Conversely, in such cases the conductivity must be expressed as a [[complex number]] (or even as a matrix of complex numbers, in the case of [[anisotropic]] materials) called the ''[[Admittance|admittivity]]''. Admittivity is the sum of a real component called the conductivity and an imaginary component called the [[Susceptance|susceptivity]].

An alternative description of the response to alternating currents uses a real (but frequency-dependent) conductivity, along with a real [[permittivity]]. The larger the conductivity is, the more quickly the alternating-current signal is absorbed by the material (i.e., the more [[opacity (optics)|opaque]] the material is). For details, see [[Mathematical descriptions of opacity]].

==Tensor equations for anisotropic materials==
Some materials are [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]], meaning they have different properties in different directions. For example, a [[crystal]] of [[graphite]] consists microscopically of a stack of sheets, and current flows very easily through each sheet, but moves much less easily from one sheet to the next.&lt;ref name=Pierson/&gt;

For an anisotropic material, it is not generally valid to use the scalar equations
:&lt;math&gt; J = \sigma E \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, E = \rho J . \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
For example, the current may not flow in exactly the same direction as the electric field. Instead, the equations are generalized to the 3D tensor form&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Tyldesley (1975) ''An introduction to Tensor Analysis: For Engineers and Applied Scientists'', Longman, ISBN 0-582-44355-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Woan (2010) ''The Cambridge Handbook of Physics Formulas'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-57507-2&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E} \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, \mathbf{E} = \rho \mathbf{J} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where the conductivity ''σ'' and resistivity ''ρ'' are rank-2 [[tensor]]s (in other words, 3×3 matrices). The equations are compactly illustrated in component form (using [[index notation]] and the [[Einstein notation|summation convention]]):&lt;ref&gt;K.F. Riley, M.P. Hobson, S.J. Bence (2010) ''Mathematical methods for physics and engineering'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-86153-3&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; J_i = \sigma_{ij} E_j \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, E_i = \rho_{ij} J_j . \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The ''σ'' and ''ρ'' tensors are inverses (in the sense of a [[Invertible matrix|matrix inverse]]). The individual components are not necessarily inverses; for example, ''σ&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;'' may not be equal to 1/''ρ&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Resistance versus resistivity in complicated geometries==
Even if the material's resistivity is known, calculating the resistance of something made from it may, in some cases, be much more complicated than the formula &lt;math&gt;R = \rho \ell /A &lt;/math&gt; above. One example is [[spreading resistance profiling]], where the material is inhomogeneous (different resistivity in different places), and the exact paths of current flow are not obvious.

In cases like this, the formulas
:&lt;math&gt; J = \sigma E \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, E = \rho J \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
must be replaced with
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}) = \sigma(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \rho(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}), \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where '''E''' and '''J''' are now [[vector field]]s. This equation, along with the [[continuity equation]] for '''J''' and the [[Poisson's equation]] for '''E''', form a set of [[partial differential equation]]s. In special cases, an exact or approximate solution to these equations can be worked out by hand, but for very accurate answers in complex cases, computer methods like [[Finite element method|finite element analysis]] may be required.

==Resistivity density products==
In some applications where the weight of an item is very important resistivity density products are more important than absolute low resistivity – it is often possible to make the conductor thicker to make up for a higher resistivity; and then a low resistivity density product material (or equivalently a high conductance to density ratio) is desirable. For example, for long distance [[overhead power line]]s, aluminium is frequently used rather than copper because it is lighter for the same conductance.

Silver, although it is the least resistive metal known, has a high density and does poorly by this measure. Calcium and the alkali metals have the best resistivity-density products, but are rarely used for conductors due to their high reactivity with water and oxygen. Aluminium is far more stable. Two other important attributes, price and toxicity, exclude the (otherwise) best choice: Beryllium. Thus, aluminium is usually the metal of choice when the weight or cost of a conductor is the driving consideration.

'''Suction''' is the flow of a fluid into a partial [[vacuum]], or region of low pressure. The [[pressure gradient force|pressure gradient]] between this region and the ambient pressure will propel matter toward the low pressure area. Suction is popularly thought of as an attractive effect, which is incorrect since vacuums do not innately attract matter.  Dust is &quot;sucked&quot; into a [[vacuum cleaner]] when it is pushed in by the higher pressure air on the outside of the cleaner. The higher pressure of the surrounding fluid can push matter into a vacuum but a vacuum cannot attract matter.

Humans can create a sucking effect with the use of the lips, as in the case of drinking through a [[drinking straw|straw]].

==Pumps==
{{main|Pump}}
{{also|Suction pump}}
[[Pumps]] typically have an inlet where the fluid enters the pump and an outlet where the fluid comes out. The inlet location is said to be at the '''suction side''' of the pump. The outlet location is said to be at the '''discharge side''' of the pump. Operation of the pump creates suction (a lower pressure) at the suction side so that fluid can enter the pump through the inlet. Pump operation also causes higher pressure at the discharge side by forcing the fluid out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the pump's suction and/or discharge sides which control the operation of the pump. For example, if the suction pressure of a [[centrifugal pump]] is too low, a device may trigger the pump to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.

Under normal conditions of [[atmospheric pressure]] suction can draw pure water up to a maximum height of approximately 10.3 m (33.9 [[Foot (length)|feet]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Calvert|2000|loc=&quot;[http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/fluids/hydstat.htm#Maxh Maximum height to which water can be raised by a suction pump]&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Suction (medicine)|In medicine, suction]] devices are used to clear airways of materials that would impede breathing or cause infections, to aid in surgery, and for other purposes.

In the [[drilling industry]], the '''rate of penetration''' ('''ROP'''), is the speed at which a [[Drill bit#Well drilling bits|drill bit]] breaks the [[Rock (geology)|rock]] under it to deepen the [[borehole]]. Also known as ''[[penetration rate]]'' or ''[[drill rate]]''. It is normally measured in feet per minute or meters per hour, but sometimes it is expressed in minutes per foot.

Generally, ROP increases in fast drilling formation such as sandstone (positive drill break) and decreases in slow drilling formations such as shale (reverse break). ROP decreases in shale due to diagenesis and overburden stresses.

Over pressured zones can give twice of ROP as expected which is an indicative of a well kick. Drillers needs to stop and do the bottoms up.

'''Specific gravity''' is the ratio of the [[density]] of a substance to the density of a reference substance; equivalently, it is the ratio of the [[mass]] of a substance to the mass of a reference substance for the same given volume. ''Apparent'' specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a volume of the substance to the weight of an equal volume of the reference substance. The reference substance is nearly always [[water (molecule)|water]] at its densest (4°C) for liquids and for gases it is air at room temperature (21°C). Nonetheless, the temperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference. Pressure is nearly always 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (101.325 kPa).  Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry. In British beer brewing, the practice for specific gravity as specified above is to multiply it by 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, J.S., Briggs, D.E., Stevens, R and Young, T.W. Malting and Brewing Science, Vol. II Hopped Wort and Beer, Chapman and Hall, London, 1991, p. 881&lt;/ref&gt; Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as brines, hydrocarbons, sugar solutions (syrups, juices, honeys, brewers [[wort]], [[must]] etc.) and acids.

==Details==
Being a ratio of densities, specific gravity is a [[dimensionless quantity]]. Specific gravity varies with temperature and pressure; reference and sample must be compared at the same temperature and pressure or be corrected to a standard reference temperature and pressure. Substances with a specific gravity of 1 are neutrally buoyant in water. Those with SG greater than 1 are denser than water and will, disregarding [[surface tension]] effects, sink in it. Those with an SG less than 1 are less dense than water and will float on it. In scientific work, the relationship of mass to volume is usually expressed directly in terms of the density (mass per unit volume) of the substance under study. It is in industry where specific gravity finds wide application, often for historical reasons.

True specific gravity can be expressed mathematically as:

:&lt;math&gt; SG_\text{true} = \frac {\rho_\text{sample}}{\rho_{\rm H_2O}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{sample}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the sample and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\rm H_2O}&lt;/math&gt; is the density of water.

The apparent specific gravity is simply the ratio of the weights of equal volumes of sample and water in air:

:&lt;math&gt; SG_\text{apparent} = \frac {W_{A_\text{sample}}}{W_{A_{\rm H_2O}}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; W_{A_\text{sample}} &lt;/math&gt; represents the weight of sample and &lt;math&gt; W_{A_{\rm H_2O}} &lt;/math&gt; the weight of water, both measured in air.

It can be shown that true specific gravity can be computed from different properties:

:&lt;math&gt; SG_\text{true} = \frac {\rho_\text{sample}}{\rho_{\rm H_2O}} = \frac {(m_\text{sample}/V)}{(m_{\rm H_2O}/V)} = \frac {m_\text{sample}}{m_{\rm H_2O}} \frac{g}{g} = \frac {W_{V_\text{sample}}}{W_{V_{\rm H_2O}}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; is the local acceleration due to gravity, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the sample and of water (the same for both), &lt;math&gt;{\rho_\text{sample}}&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the sample, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\rm H_2O}&lt;/math&gt; is the density of water and &lt;math&gt; W_V &lt;/math&gt; represents a weight obtained in vacuum.

The density of water varies with temperature and pressure as does the density of the sample. So it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or weights were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at 1 nominal atmosphere (1013.25 mbar ± variations from changing weather patterns). But as specific gravity usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products), variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent specific gravity is being measured. For true (''in vacuo'') specific gravity calculations, air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation &lt;math&gt;(T_\text{s}/T_\text{r})&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;T_\text{s}&lt;/math&gt; representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and &lt;math&gt;T_\text{r}&lt;/math&gt; the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example, SG (20°C/4°C) would be understood to mean that the density of the sample was determined at 20°C and of the water at 4°C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures, we note that, while &lt;math&gt;SG_{\rm H_2O} = 1.000000 &lt;/math&gt; (20°C/20°C), it is also the case that &lt;math&gt;SG_{\rm H_2O} = 0.998203/0.999840 = 0.998363 &lt;/math&gt; (20°C/4°C). Here, temperature is being specified using the current [[ITS-90]] scale and the densities&lt;ref&gt;Bettin, H.; Spieweck, F.: &quot;Die Dichte des Wassers als Funktion der Temperatur nach Einführung des Internationalen Temperaturskala von 1990&quot; PTB-Mitteilungen 100 (1990) pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt; used here and in the rest of this article are based on that scale. On the previous IPTS-68 scale, the densities at 20 °C and 4 °C are 0.9982071 and 0.9999720 respectively, resulting in an SG (20°C/4°C) value for water of 0.9982343.

As the principal use of specific gravity measurements in industry is determination of the concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and as these are found in tables of SG vs concentration, it is extremely important that the analyst enter the table with the correct form of specific gravity. For example, in the brewing industry, the [[Plato scale|Plato table]] lists sucrose concentration by weight against true SG, and was originally (20°C/4°C)&lt;ref&gt;ASBC Methods of Analysis Preface to Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer, American Society of Brewing Chemists, St Paul, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. based on measurements of the density of sucrose solutions made at laboratory temperature (20 °C) but referenced to the density of water at 4 °C which is very close to the temperature at which water has its maximum density &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\rm H_2O}&lt;/math&gt; equal to 0.999972&amp;nbsp;g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in [[International System of Units|SI units]] (or 62.43&amp;nbsp;lb&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;·ft&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in [[United States customary units]]). The [[American Society of Brewing Chemists|ASBC]] table&lt;ref&gt;ASBC Methods of Analysis ''op. cit.'' Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer&lt;/ref&gt; in use today in North America, while it is derived from the original Plato table is for apparent specific gravity measurements at (20°C/20°C) on the IPTS-68 scale where the density of water is 0.9982071&amp;nbsp;g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries sucrose concentration by weight is taken from a table prepared by [[Brix|A. Brix]] which uses SG (17.5°C/17.5°C). As a final example, the British SG units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60F and are thus (15.56°C/15.56°C).

Given the specific gravity of a substance, its actual density can be calculated by rearranging the above formula:

:&lt;math&gt;{\rho_\text{substance}} = SG \times \rho_{\rm H_2O}.&lt;/math&gt;

Occasionally a reference substance other than water is specified (for example, air), in which case specific gravity means density relative to that reference.

==Measurement: apparent and true specific gravity==
===Pycnometer===

Specific gravity can be measured in a number of value ways. The following illustration involving the use of the [[pycnometer]] is instructive. A pycnometer is simply a bottle which can be precisely filled to a specific, but not necessarily accurately known volume, &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt;. Placed upon a balance of some sort it will exert a force .

:&lt;math&gt; F_b = g(m_b - \rho_a{m_b\over \rho_b}) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; m_b &lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the bottle and &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; the [[gravitational acceleration]] at the location at which the measurements are being made. &lt;math&gt; \rho_a &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the air at the ambient pressure and &lt;math&gt; \rho_b &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the material of which the bottle is made (usually glass) so that the second term is the mass of air displaced by the glass of the bottle whose weight, by [[Archimedes' principle#Archimedes' principle|Archimedes Principle]] must be subtracted. The bottle is, of course, filled with air but as that air displaces an equal amount of air the weight of that air is canceled by the weight of the air displaced. Now we fill the bottle with the reference fluid e.g. pure water. The force exerted on the pan of the balance becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; F_w = g(m_b - \rho_a{m_b\over \rho_b} + V\rho_w - V\rho_a). &lt;/math&gt;

If we subtract the force measured on the empty bottle from this (or tare the balance before making the water measurement) we obtain.

:&lt;math&gt;F_{w,n} = gV( \rho_w - \rho_a) &lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript n indicated that this force is net of the force of the empty bottle. The bottle is now emptied, thoroughly dried and refilled with the sample. The force, net of the empty bottle, is now:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{s,n} = gV(\rho_s - \rho_a) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \rho_s &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the sample. The ratio of the sample and water forces is:

:&lt;math&gt;SG_A = {gV(\rho_s - \rho_a) \over gV( \rho_w - \rho_a)} = {( \rho_s - \rho_a) \over ( \rho_w - \rho_a)}. &lt;/math&gt;

This is called the Apparent Specific Gravity, denoted by subscript A, because it is what we would obtain if we took the ratio of net weighings in air from an analytical balance or used a [[hydrometer]] (the stem displaces air). Note that the result does not depend on the calibration of the balance. The only requirement on it is that it read linearly with force. Nor does &lt;math&gt;SG_A&lt;/math&gt; depend on the actual volume of the pycnometer. 

Further manipulation and finally substitution of &lt;math&gt; SG_V &lt;/math&gt;,the true specific gravity,(the subscript V is used because this is often referred to as the specific gravity ''in vacuo'') for &lt;math&gt; \rho_s \over \rho_w &lt;/math&gt; gives the relationship between apparent and true specific gravity.

:&lt;math&gt;SG_A= {{\rho_s \over \rho_w}-{\rho_a \over \rho_w} \over 1 - {\rho_a \over \rho_w}} ={SG_V-{\rho_a \over \rho_w} \over 1 - {\rho_a \over \rho_w}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the usual case we will have measured weights and want the true specific gravity. This is found from

:&lt;math&gt;SG_V = SG_A - {\rho_a \over \rho_w }(SG_A-1).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the density of dry air at 1013.25 mb at 20 °C is&lt;ref&gt;DIN51 757 (04.1994): Testing of mineral oils and related materials; determination of density&lt;/ref&gt; 0.001205 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and that of water is 0.998203 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; the difference between true and apparent specific gravities for a substance with specific gravity (20°C/20°C) of about 1.100 would be 0.000120. Where the specific gravity of the sample is close to that of water (for example dilute ethanol solutions) the correction is even smaller.

===Digital density meters===
''Hydrostatic Pressure-based Instruments'': This technology relies upon Pascal's Principle which states that the pressure difference between two points within a vertical column of fluid is dependent upon the vertical distance between the two points, the density of the fluid and the gravitational force. This technology is often used for tank gauging applications as a convenient means of liquid level and density measure.  

''Vibrating Element Transducers'': This type of instrument requires a vibrating element to be placed in contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of specific gravity are made using [[oscillating U-tube]] meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80 °C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or true specific gravity and contain tables relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc. The vibrating fork immersion probe is another good example of this technology. This technology also includes many coriolis-type mass flow meters which are widely used in chemical and petroleum industry for high accuracy mass flow measurement and can be configured to also output density information based on the resonant frequency of the vibrating flow tubes.

''Ultrasonic Transducer'': Ultrasonic waves are passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a detector which measures the acoustic spectroscopy of the waves. Fluid properties such as density and viscosity can be inferred from the spectrum.

''Radiation-based Gauge'': Radiation is passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a scintillation detector, or counter. As the fluid density increases, the detected radiation &quot;counts&quot; will decrease. The source is typically the radioactive isotope [[cesium-137]], with a half-life of about 30 years. A key advantage for this technology is that the instrument is not required to be in contact with the fluid – typically the source and detector are mounted on the outside of tanks or piping. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohmartvega.com/en/nuclear_density_DSG.htm Density – VEGA Americas, Inc]. Ohmartvega.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Buoyant Force Transducer'': the buoyancy force produced by a float in a homogeneous liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid that is displaced by the float. Since buoyancy force is linear with respect to the density of the liquid within which the float is submerged, the measure of the buoyancy force yields a measure of the density of the liquid. One commercially available unit claims the instrument is capable of measuring specific gravity with an accuracy of +/- 0.005 SG units. The submersible probe head contains a mathematically characterized spring-float system. When the head is immersed vertically in the liquid, the float moves vertically and the position of the float controls the position of a permanent magnet whose displacement is sensed by a concentric array of Hall-effect linear displacement sensors. The output signals of the sensors are mixed in a dedicated electronics module that provides an output voltage whose magnitude is a direct linear measure of the quantity to be measured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardco.com/pages/density/electric_hydrometer.cfm Process Control Digital Electronic Hydrometer]. Gardco. Retrieved on 2011-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

''In-Line Continuous Measurement'': Slurry is weighed as it travels through the metered section of pipe using a patented, high resolution load cell. This section of pipe is of optimal length such that a truly representative mass of the slurry may be determined. This representative mass is then interrogated by the load cell 110 times per second to ensure accurate and repeatable measurement of the slurry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18399">In [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]], the mass [[moment of inertia]], usually denoted by {{mvar|I}}, measures the extent to which an object resists rotational acceleration about a particular axis, and is the rotational analogue to mass. Mass moments of inertia have [[physical unit|units]] of [[dimensional analysis|dimension]] ML&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;([mass] × [length]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It should not be confused with the [[second moment of area]], which is used in bending calculations. The mass moment of inertia is often also known as the rotational inertia, and sometimes as the angular mass.

For simple objects with geometric symmetry, one can often determine the moment of inertia in an exact [[closed-form expression]]. Typically this occurs when the [[mass density]] is constant, but in some cases the density can vary throughout the object as well. In general, it may not be straightforward to symbolically express the moment of inertia of shapes with more complicated mass distributions and lacking symmetry. When calculating moments of inertia, it is useful to remember that it is an additive function and exploit the [[parallel axis theorem|parallel axis]] and [[perpendicular axis theorem]]s.

This article mainly considers symmetric mass distributions, with constant density throughout the object, and the axis of rotation is taken to be through the [[center of mass]] unless otherwise specified.

==Moments of inertia==

Following are scalar moments of inertia. In general, the moment of inertia is a tensor, see below.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Description || Figure || Moment(s) of inertia
|-
| Point mass ''m'' at a distance ''r'' from the axis of rotation.

A point mass does not have a moment of inertia around its own axis, but using the [[parallel axis theorem]] a moment of inertia around a distant axis of rotation is achieved.

|align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:PointInertia.svg|170px]]
| &lt;math&gt; I = m r^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Two point masses, ''M'' and ''m'', with [[reduced mass]] ''μ'' and separated by a distance, ''x''.
|align=&quot;center&quot;|
| &lt;math&gt; I = \frac{ M m }{ M \! + \! m } x^2 = \mu x^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Rod (geometry)|Rod]] of length ''L'' and mass ''m'', rotating about its center.

This expression assumes that the rod is an infinitely thin (but rigid) wire. This is a special case of the thin rectangular plate with axis of rotation at the center of the plate, with ''w'' = ''L'' and ''h'' = ''0''.

| align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:moment of inertia rod center.svg|170px]]

|-
| [[Rod (geometry)|Rod]] of length ''L'' and mass ''m'', rotating about one end.

This expression assumes that the rod is an infinitely thin (but rigid) wire. This is also a special case of the thin rectangular plate with axis of rotation at the end of the plate, with ''h'' = ''L'' and ''w'' = ''0''.

| align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:moment of inertia rod end.svg|170px]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{end}} = \frac{m L^2}{3} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=&quot;serway&quot;/&gt;
|-
| Thin circular hoop of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This is a special case of a [[torus]] for ''b'' = 0 (see below), as well as of a thick-walled cylindrical tube with open ends, with ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h'' = 0.

| align=&quot;center&quot;|[[File:moment of inertia hoop.svg|170px]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_z = m r^2\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{m r^2}{2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Thin, solid [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This is a special case of the solid cylinder, with ''h'' = 0. That &lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{I_z}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a consequence of the [[Perpendicular axis theorem]].

|align=&quot;center&quot;| [[File:moment of inertia disc.svg|170px]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_z = \frac{m r^2}{2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{m r^2}{4}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Thin [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] shell with open ends, of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This expression assumes that the shell thickness is negligible. It is a special case of the thick-walled cylindrical tube for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Also, a point mass ''m'' at the end of a rod of length ''r'' has this same moment of inertia and the value ''r'' is called the [[radius of gyration]].&lt;/p&gt;

== List of 3D inertia tensors ==

This list of [[Moment of inertia#The inertia tensor|moment of inertia tensor]]s is given for [[Principal axis theorem|principal axes]] of each object.

To obtain the scalar moments of inertia ''I'' above, the tensor moment of inertia '''I''' is projected along some axis defined by a [[unit vector]] '''n''' according to the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{n}\equiv n_i I_{ij} n_j\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the dots indicate [[tensor contraction]] and we have used the [[Einstein summation convention]]. In the above table, '''n''' would be the unit [[Cartesian coordinate system#Representing a vector in the standard basis|Cartesian basis]] '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain ''I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively.

{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[List of thermodynamic properties|System properties]]}}
In [[thermodynamics]], '''vapour quality''' is the [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]] in a saturated mixture that is [[vapour]];&lt;ref name=boles&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Cengel | first1 = Yunus A. | last2 = Boles | first2 = Michael A. | title = Thermodynamics: an engineering approach | year = 2002 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = Boston  | isbn = 0-07-121688-X | pages = 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. saturated vapour has a &quot;quality&quot; of 100%, and saturated liquid has a &quot;quality&quot; of 0%.  Vapour quality is an [[intensive property]] which can be used in conjunction with other independent intensive properties to specify the [[thermodynamic state]] of the working fluid of a [[thermodynamic system]]. It has no meaning for substances which are not [[saturated fluid|saturated mixture]]s (i.e., compressed liquids or superheated fluids).

Quality &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by dividing the mass of the vapour by the mass of the total mixture:
:&lt;math&gt;\chi = \frac{m_{vapour}}{m_{total}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; indicates mass.

Another definition used by chemical engineers defines quality (q) of a fluid as the fraction that is saturated liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wankat|first=Philip C.|title=Equilibrium Staged Separations|publisher=Prentice Hall|place=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|year=1988|pages=119–121|isbn=0-13-500968-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition, a saturated liquid has q = 0. A saturated vapour has q = 1.&lt;ref&gt;Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook (7th Edition), p 13-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==
The above expression for vapour quality can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\chi = \frac{y - y_f}{y_g - y_f}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is equal to either [[specific enthalpy]], specific [[entropy]], [[specific volume]] or [[specific internal energy]], &lt;math&gt;y_f&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the specific property of saturated liquid state and &lt;math&gt;y_{g}-y_{f}&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the specific property of the substance in dome zone, which we can find both liquid &lt;math&gt;y_{f}&lt;/math&gt; and vapor &lt;math&gt;y_{g}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another expression of the same concept is:
:&lt;math&gt;\chi=\frac{m_v}{m_l + m_v}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m_v&lt;/math&gt; is the vapour mass and &lt;math&gt;m_l&lt;/math&gt; is the liquid mass.

==Steam quality==
The genesis of the idea of vapour quality was derived from the origins of [[thermodynamics]], where an important application was the steam engine. Low quality steam would contain a high [[moisture]] percentage and therefore damage components more easily{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. High quality steam would not [[corrode]] the steam engine. [[Steam engine]]s use water vapour ([[steam]]) to drive pistons or turbines which create work. The quality of steam can be quantitatively described by ''steam quality'' (steam dryness),  the proportion of [[#Saturated steam|saturated steam]] in a saturated water/steam mixture. I.e., a steam quality of 0 indicates 100% water while a steam quality of 1 (or 100%) indicates 100% steam.

The quality of steam on which [[steam whistle]]s are blown is variable and may affect [[frequency]]. Steam quality determines the [[velocity of sound]], which declines with decreasing dryness due to the [[inertia]] of the [[liquid phase]]. Also, the [[specific volume]] of steam for a given temperature decreases with decreasing dryness.&lt;ref&gt;Soo, Shao L. (1989). Particulates and Continuum: A Multiphase Fluid Dynamics. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menon, E. Sashi. (2005). Piping Calculations Manual. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam quality is very useful in determining [[enthalpy]] of saturated water/steam mixtures since the enthalpy of steam (gaseous state) is many orders of magnitude higher than enthalpy of water (liquid state).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4336">In [[physics]] and [[engineering]], '''surface power density''' or sometimes simply '''specific power'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec04.html]&lt;/ref&gt; is [[power (physics)|power]] per unit [[area]].

==Applications==
* The intensity of [[electromagnetic waves|electromagnetic radiation]] can be expressed in W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. An example of such a quantity is the [[solar constant]].
* [[Wind turbine]]s are often compared using a specific power measuring watts per [[square meter]] of turbine disk area, which is &lt;math&gt;\pi r^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''r'' is the length of a blade. This measure is also commonly used for [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s, at least for typical applications.
* [[Radiance]] is surface power density per unit of solid angle (steradians) in a specific direction.  [[Spectral radiance]] is radiance per unit of frequency (Hertz) at a specific frequency.

===Electromagnetic wave===
As an electromagnetic wave travels through space, energy is transferred from the source to other objects (receivers). The rate of this energy transfer depends on the strength of the EM field components. Simply put, the rate of energy transfer per unit area (power density) is the product of the electric field strength (E) times the magnetic field strength (H).&lt;ref name=OSHA-Pwr-density/&gt;

:Pd (Watts/meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = E × H (Volts/meter × Amperes/meter)
where
:Pd = the power density,
:E = the RMS electric field strength in volts per meter,
:H = the RMS magnetic field strength in amperes per meter.&lt;ref name=OSHA-Pwr-density/&gt;

The above equation yields units of W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; . The units of mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, are more often used when making surveys. One mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the same power density as 10 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The following equation can be used to obtain these units directly:&lt;ref name=OSHA-Pwr-density/&gt;

:Pd = 0.1 × E × H mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

The simplified relationships stated above apply at distances of about two or more wavelengths from the radiating source. This distance can be a far distance at low frequencies, and is called the far field. Here the ratio between E and H becomes a fixed constant (377 Ohms) and is called the [[characteristic impedance of free space]]. Under these conditions we can determine the power density by measuring only the E field component (or H field component, if you prefer) and calculating the power density from it.&lt;ref name=OSHA-Pwr-density/&gt;

This fixed relationship is useful for measuring radio frequency or microwave (electromagnetic) fields.Since power is the rate of energy transfer, and the squares of E and H are proportional to power, E&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are proportional to the energy transfer rate and the energy absorption of a given material.&lt;ref name=OSHA-Pwr-density&gt;

====Far field====

The region extending farther than about 2 [[wavelength]]s away from the source is called the [[far field]]. As the source emits [[electromagnetic radiation]] of a given wavelength, the far-field  [[electric field|electric component]] of the wave '''''E''''', the far-field [[magnetic field|magnetic component]] '''''H''''', and '''''power density''''' are related by the equations: E = H × 377 and Pd = E × H.

::E&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =  the square of the value of the electric field in volts RMS squared per meter squared.&lt;ref name=OSHA-Pwr-density/&gt;

The '''electrical resistance''' of an [[electrical conductor]] is a measure of the difficulty to pass an [[electric current]] through that conductor. The inverse quantity is '''electrical conductance''', the ease with which an electric current passes.  Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical [[friction]]. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of electrical resistance is the [[ohm]] ([[Omega|Ω]]), while electrical conductance is measured in [[siemens (unit)|siemens]] (S).

An object of uniform cross section has a resistance proportional to its [[resistivity]] and length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. All materials show some resistance, except for [[superconductor]]s, which have a resistance of zero.

The resistance (R) of an object is defined as the ratio of [[voltage]] across it (''V'') to [[Electric current|current]] through it (''I''), while the conductance (G) is the inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;R = {V\over I}, \qquad G = {I\over V} = \frac{1}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

For a wide variety of materials and conditions, ''V'' and ''I'' are directly proportional to each other, and therefore ''R'' and ''G'' are [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] (although they can depend on other factors like temperature or strain). This proportionality is called [[Ohm's law]], and materials that satisfy it are called ''ohmic'' materials.

In other cases, such as a [[diode]] or [[battery (electricity)|battery]], ''V'' and ''I'' are ''not'' directly proportional. The ratio V/I is sometimes still useful, and is referred to as a &quot;chordal resistance&quot; or &quot;static resistance&quot;,&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book | title = Engineering System Dynamics | author = Forbes T.

In other situations, the [[derivative]] &lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dI} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; may be most useful; this is called the &quot;differential resistance&quot;.

==Introduction==

[[File:ResistanceHydraulicAnalogy.svg|thumb|The [[hydraulic analogy]] compares electric current flowing through circuits to water flowing through pipes. When a pipe (left) is filled with hair (right), it takes a larger pressure to achieve the same flow of water. Pushing electric current through a large resistance is like pushing water through a pipe clogged with hair: It requires a larger push ([[electromotive force]]) to drive the same flow ([[electric current]]).]]

In the [[hydraulic analogy]], current flowing through a wire (or [[resistor]]) is like water flowing through a pipe, and the [[voltage drop]] across the wire is like the [[pressure drop]] that pushes water through the pipe. Conductance is proportional to how much flow occurs for a given pressure, and resistance is proportional to how much pressure is required to achieve a given flow. (Conductance and resistance are [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]].)

The [[voltage drop|voltage ''drop'']] (i.e., difference between voltages on one side of the resistor and the other), not the [[voltage]] itself, provides the driving force pushing current through a resistor. In hydraulics, it is similar: The pressure ''difference'' between two sides of a pipe, not the pressure itself, determines the flow through it. For example, there may be a large water pressure above the pipe, which tries to push water down through the pipe. But there may be an equally large water pressure below the pipe, which tries to push water back up through the pipe. If these pressures are equal, no water flows. (In the image at right, the water pressure below the pipe is zero.)

The resistance and conductance of a wire, resistor, or other element is mostly determined by two properties:

* geometry (shape), and 
* material

Geometry is important because it is more difficult to push water through a long, narrow pipe than a wide, short pipe. In the same way, a long, thin copper wire has higher resistance (lower conductance) than a short, thick copper wire.

Materials are important as well. A pipe filled with hair restricts the flow of water more than a clean pipe of the same shape and size. Similarly, [[electron]]s can flow freely and easily through a [[copper]] wire, but cannot flow as easily through a [[steel]] wire of the same shape and size, and they essentially cannot flow at all through an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] like [[rubber]], regardless of its shape. The difference between, copper, steel, and rubber is related to their microscopic structure and [[electron configuration]], and is quantified by a property called [[resistivity]].

In addition to geometry and material, there are various other factors that influence resistance and conductance, such as temperature; see [[#Dependence of resistance on other conditions|below]].

==Conductors and resistors==
[[File:Metal film resistor.jpg|thumb|250px|A 6.5 MΩ [[resistor]], as identified by its [[electronic color code]] (blue–green–black-yellow). &lt;!-- This resistor uses the 4 band variant of the colour code so the bands represent 6 - 5 - 0 - x10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; making 6 500 000 Ω ---&gt; An [[ohmmeter]] could be used to verify this value.]]

Substances in which electricity can flow are called [[electrical conductor|conductors]].  A piece of conducting material of a particular resistance meant for use in a circuit is called a [[resistor]].  Conductors are made of high-[[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] materials such as metals, in particular copper and aluminium. Resistors, on the other hand, are made of a wide variety of materials depending on factors such as the desired resistance, amount of energy that it needs to dissipate, precision, and costs.

==Ohm's law==
[[File:FourIVcurves.svg|thumb|500px|The [[current-voltage characteristic]]s of four devices: Two [[resistor]]s, a [[diode]], and a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. The horizontal axis is [[voltage drop]], the vertical axis is [[electric current|current]]. Ohm's law is satisfied when the graph is a straight line through the origin. Therefore, the two resistors are ''ohmic'', but the diode and battery are not.]]
{{main|Ohm's law}}
Ohm's law is an empirical law relating the voltage ''V'' across an element to the current ''I'' through it:
:&lt;math&gt;I \propto V&lt;/math&gt;

(''I'' is directly proportional to ''V''). This law is not always true: For example, it is false for [[diode]]s, [[battery (electrical)|batteries]], and other devices whose conductance is not constant. However, it is true to a very good approximation for wires and [[resistor]]s (assuming that other conditions, including temperature, are held constant). Materials or objects where Ohm's law is true are called ''ohmic'', whereas objects that do not obey Ohm's law are ''non-ohmic''.

== Relation to resistivity and conductivity ==
[[File:Resistivity geometry.png|thumb|A piece of resistive material with electrical contacts on both ends.]]
{{main|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}
The resistance of a given object depends primarily on two factors: What material it is made of, and its shape. For a given material, the resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area; for example, a thick copper wire has lower resistance than an otherwise-identical thin copper wire. Also, for a given material, the resistance is proportional to the length; for example, a long copper wire has higher resistance than an otherwise-identical short copper wire. The resistance {{math|R}} and conductance {{math|G}} of a conductor of uniform cross section, therefore, can be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  R &amp;= \rho \frac{\ell}{A}, \\
  G &amp;= \sigma \frac{A}{\ell}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the conductor, measured in [[metre]]s [m], ''A'' is the cross-sectional area of the conductor measured in [[square metre]]s [m²], σ ([[Sigma (letter)|sigma]]) is the [[electrical conductivity]] measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per meter (S·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), and ρ ([[Rho (letter)|rho]]) is the [[electrical resistivity]] (also called ''specific electrical resistance'') of the material, measured in ohm-metres (Ω·m). The resistivity and conductivity are proportionality constants, and therefore depend only on the material the wire is made of, not the geometry of the wire. Resistivity and conductivity are [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]]: &lt;math&gt;\rho=1/\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Resistivity is a measure of the material's ability to oppose electric current.

This formula is not exact, as it assumes the [[current density]] is totally uniform in the conductor, which is not always true in practical situations. However, this formula still provides a good approximation for long thin conductors such as wires.

Another situation for which this formula is not exact is with [[alternating current]] (AC), because the [[skin effect]] inhibits current flow near the center of the conductor. For this reason, the ''geometrical'' cross-section is different from the ''effective'' cross-section in which current actually flows, so resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors near each other carry AC current, their resistances increase due to the [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]. At [[utility frequency|commercial power frequency]], these  effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as [[busbar]]s in an [[electrical substation]],&lt;ref&gt;Fink and Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', page 17-19&lt;/ref&gt; or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.

===What determines resistivity?===
{{main|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}
The resistivity of different materials varies by an enormous amount: For example, the conductivity of [[PTFE|teflon]] is about 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; times lower than the conductivity of copper. Why is there such a difference? Loosely speaking, a metal has large numbers of &quot;delocalized&quot; electrons that are not stuck in any one place, but free to move across large distances, whereas in an insulator (like teflon), each electron is tightly bound to a single molecule, and a great force is required to pull it away. [[Semiconductor]]s lie between these two extremes. More details can be found in the article: [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]]. For the case of [[electrolyte]] solutions, see the article: [[Conductivity (electrolytic)]].

Resistivity varies with temperature. In semiconductors, resistivity also changes when exposed to light. See [[#Dependence of resistance on other conditions|below]].

==Measuring resistance==
{{main|ohmmeter}}

An instrument for measuring resistance is called an [[ohmmeter]].  Simple ohmmeters cannot measure low resistances accurately because the resistance of their measuring leads causes a voltage drop that interferes with the measurement, so more accurate devices use [[four-terminal sensing]].

{{see also|Small-signal model}}

Many electrical elements, such as [[diode]]s and [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] do ''not'' satisfy [[Ohm's law]]. These are called ''non-ohmic'' or ''non-linear'', and are characterized by an [[I–V curve|''I–V'' curve]], which is ''not'' a straight line through the origin.

Resistance and conductance can still be defined for non-ohmic elements.  However, unlike ohmic resistance, non-linear resistance is not constant but varies with the voltage or current through the device; i.e., its [[Biasing|operating point]].  There are two types of resistance:&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser/&gt;

*'''Static resistance''' (also called ''chordal'' or ''DC resistance'') - This corresponds to the usual definition of resistance; the voltage divided by the current 
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {V}{I} \,&lt;/math&gt;. 
:It is the slope of the line ([[chord (geometry)|chord]]) from the origin through the point on the curve.  Static resistance determines the power dissipation in an electrical component.  Points on the ''IV'' curve located in the 2nd or 4th quadrants, for which the slope of the chordal line is negative, have ''negative static resistance''.  [[Passivity (engineering)|Passive]] devices, which have no source of energy, cannot have negative static resistance.  However active devices such as transistors or [[op-amp]]s can synthesize negative static resistance with feedback, and it is used in some circuits such as [[gyrator]]s.

*'''Differential resistance''' (also called ''dynamic'', ''incremental'' or ''small signal resistance'') - [[Electrical resistance#Static and differential resistance|Differential resistance]] is the derivative of the voltage with respect to the current; the [[slope]] of the ''IV'' curve at a point 
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{diff} = \frac {dV}{dI}  \,&lt;/math&gt;.
:If the ''IV'' curve is non[[monotonic]] (with peaks and troughs), the curve has a negative slope in some regions—so in these regions the device has ''[[negative differential resistance]]''.  Devices with negative differential resistance can amplify a signal applied to them, and are used to make amplifiers and oscillators.  These include [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s, [[magnetron]] tubes, and [[unijunction transistor]]s.

==AC circuits==

===Impedance and admittance===
[[File:VI phase.png|thumb|right|300px|The voltage (red) and current (blue) versus time (horizontal axis) for a [[capacitor]] (top) and [[inductor]] (bottom). Since the [[amplitude]] of the current and voltage [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]s are the same, the [[absolute value]] of [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is 1 for both the capacitor and the inductor (in whatever units the graph is using). On the other hand, the [[phase (waves)|phase difference]] between current and voltage is -90° for the capacitor; therefore, the [[argument (complex analysis)|complex phase]] of the [[electrical impedance|impedance]] of the capacitor is -90°. Similarly, the [[phase (waves)|phase difference]] between current and voltage is +90° for the inductor; therefore, the complex phase of the impedance of the inductor is +90°.]]
{{main|Electrical impedance|Admittance}}
When an alternating current flows through a circuit, the relation between current and voltage across a circuit element is characterized not only by the ratio of their magnitudes, but also the difference in their [[Phase (waves)|phases]]. For example, in an ideal resistor, the moment when the voltage reaches its maximum, the current also reaches its maximum (current and voltage are oscillating in phase). But for a [[capacitor]] or [[inductor]], the maximum current flow occurs as the voltage passes through zero and vice versa (current and voltage are oscillating 90° out of phase, see image at right). [[Complex number]]s are used to keep track of both the phase and magnitude of current and voltage:
:&lt;math&gt;V(t)=\text{Re}(V_0 e^{j\omega t}), \quad I(t)=\text{Re}(I_0 e^{j\omega t}), \quad Z=\frac{V_0}{I_0}, \quad Y=\frac{I_0}{V_0}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*''t'' is time,
*''V''(''t'') and ''I''(''t'') are, respectively, voltage and current as a function of time,
*''V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''Z'', and ''Y'' are complex numbers,
*''Z'' is called [[electrical impedance|impedance]],
*''Y'' is called [[admittance]],
*Re indicates [[real part]],
*&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the AC current,
*&lt;math&gt;j=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]].
The impedance and admittance may be expressed as complex numbers that can be broken into real and imaginary parts:
:&lt;math&gt;Z=R+jX, \quad Y=G+jB&lt;/math&gt;
where ''R'' and ''G'' are resistance and conductance respectively, ''X'' is [[electrical reactance|reactance]], and ''B'' is [[susceptance]]. For ideal resistors, ''Z'' and ''Y'' reduce to ''R'' and ''G'' respectively, but for AC networks containing [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s, ''X'' and ''B'' are nonzero.

&lt;math&gt;Z=1/Y&lt;/math&gt; for AC circuits, just as &lt;math&gt;R=1/G&lt;/math&gt; for DC circuits.

===Frequency dependence of resistance===
Another complication of AC circuits is that the resistance and conductance can be frequency-dependent. One reason, mentioned above is the [[skin effect]] (and the related [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]). Another reason is that the resistivity itself may depend on frequency (see [[Drude model]], [[deep-level trap]]s, [[resonant frequency]], [[Kramers–Kronig relations]], etc.)

==Energy dissipation and Joule heating==
[[File:Cartridge-heater-hot.jpg|thumb|Running current through a material with high resistance creates heat, in a phenomenon called [[Joule heating]]. In this picture, a [[cartridge heater]], warmed by Joule heating, is [[Incandescence|glowing red hot]].]]
{{main|Joule heating}}
Resistors (and other elements with resistance) oppose the flow of electric current; therefore, electrical energy is required to push current through the resistance. This electrical energy is dissipated, heating the resistor in the process. This is called ''[[Joule heating]]'' (after [[James Prescott Joule]]), also called ''ohmic heating'' or ''resistive heating''.

The dissipation of electrical energy is often undesired, particularly in the case of [[electric power transmission|transmission losses]] in [[overhead power line|power lines]]. [[Electric power transmission|High voltage transmission]] helps reduce the losses by reducing the current for a given power.

On the other hand, Joule heating is sometimes useful, for example in [[electric stove]]s and other [[electric heating|electric heaters]] (also called ''resistive heaters''). As another example, [[incandescent lamp]]s rely on Joule heating: the filament is heated to such a high temperature that it glows &quot;white hot&quot; with [[thermal radiation]] (also called [[incandescence]]).

The formula for Joule heating is:
:&lt;math&gt;P=I^2R&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is the [[electric power|power]] (energy per unit time) converted from electrical energy to thermal energy, ''R'' is the resistance, and ''I'' is the current through the resistor.

== Dependence of resistance on other conditions ==

=== Temperature dependence ===
{{main|Electrical resistivity and conductivity#Temperature dependence}}
Near room temperature, the resistivity of metals typically increases as temperature is increased, while the resistivity of semiconductors typically decreases as temperature is increased. The resistivity of insulators and electrolytes may increase or decrease depending on the system. For the detailed behavior and explanation, see [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]].

As a consequence, the resistance of wires, resistors, and other components often change with temperature. This effect may be undesired, causing an electronic circuit to malfunction at extreme temperatures. In some cases, however, the effect is put to good use. When temperature-dependent resistance of a component is used purposefully, the component is called a [[resistance thermometer]] or [[thermistor]]. (A resistance thermometer is made of metal, usually platinum, while a thermistor is made of ceramic or polymer.)

Resistance thermometers and thermistors are generally used in two ways. First, they can be used as [[thermometer]]s: By measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, they can be used in conjunction with [[Joule heating]] (also called self-heating): If a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor's temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components can be used in a circuit-protection role similar to [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s, or for [[feedback]] in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, self-heating can turn a resistor into a [[nonlinear element|nonlinear]] and [[hysteresis|hysteretic]] circuit element. For more details see [[Thermistor#Self-heating effects]].

If the temperature ''T'' does not vary too much, a [[linear approximation]] is typically used:
:&lt;math&gt;R(T) = R_0[1+\alpha (T - T_0)]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''temperature coefficient of resistance'', &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance at temperature &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; was measured at with a suffix, such as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{15}&lt;/math&gt;, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, MR, ''Electrical Engineering Science'', pp36–40, McGraw-Hill, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temperature coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is typically +3×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to +6×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for metals near room temperature. It is usually negative for semiconductors and insulators, with highly variable magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]] for a table. The temperature coefficient of resistivity is similar but not identical to the temperature coefficient of resistance. The small difference is due to [[thermal expansion]] changing the dimensions of the resistor.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strain dependence ===
{{main|Strain gauge}}
Just as the resistance of a conductor depends upon temperature, the resistance of a conductor depends upon [[strain (materials science)|strain]]. By placing a conductor under [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] (a form of [[stress (physics)|stress]] that leads to strain in the form of stretching of the conductor), the length of the section of conductor under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing the resistance of the strained section of conductor. Under compression (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section of conductor decreases. See the discussion on [[strain gauge]]s for details about devices constructed to take advantage of this effect.

=== Light illumination dependence ===
{{main|Photoresistor|Photoconductivity}}
Some resistors, particularly those made from [[semiconductor]]s, exhibit ''[[photoconductivity]]'', meaning that their resistance changes when light is shining on them. Therefore, they are called ''[[photoresistor]]s'' (or ''light dependent resistors''). These are a common type of [[photodetector|light detector]].

==Superconductivity==
{{main|Superconductivity}}
[[Superconductor]]s are materials that have exactly zero resistance and infinite conductance, because they can have V=0 and I≠0. This also means there is no [[joule heating]], or in other words no [[dissipation]] of electrical energy. Therefore, if superconductive wire is made into a closed loop, current flows around the loop forever. Superconductors require cooling to temperatures near 4 K with [[liquid helium]] for most metallic superconductors like [[Niobium|Nb]][[Tin|Sn]] alloys, or cooling to temperatures near 77K with [[liquid nitrogen]] for the expensive, brittle and delicate ceramic [[high temperature superconductors]].
Nevertheless, there are many [[technological applications of superconductivity]], including [[superconducting magnet]]s.

'''Acceleration''', in [[physics]], is the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of [[velocity]] of an object. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all [[force]]s acting on the object, as described by [[Newton's Second Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Principles of Mechanics |first=Henry |last=Crew |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2008 |isbn=0-559-36871-2 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for acceleration is [[metre per second squared]] (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Accelerations are [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities (they have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]]) and add according to the [[parallelogram law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativity and Common Sense |first=Hermann |last=Bondi |pages=3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1980 |isbn=0-486-24021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics the Easy Way |pages=27 |first=Robert L. |last=Lehrman |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=1998 |isbn=0-7641-0236-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Vector space|vector]], the calculated net [[force]] is equal to the product of the object's mass (a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity) and the acceleration.

For example, when a car starts from a standstill (zero relative velocity) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel. If the car turns there is an acceleration toward the new direction. For this example, we can call the accelerating of the car forward a &quot;linear acceleration&quot;, which passengers in the car might experience as force pushing them back into their seats. When changing directions, we might call this &quot;non-linear acceleration&quot;, which passengers might experience as a sideways force. If the speed of the car decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction of the direction of the vehicle, sometimes called '''deceleration'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raymond A. Serway, Chris Vuille, Jerry S. Faughn |title=College Physics, Volume 10 |year=2008 |publisher=Cengage |isbn=9780495386933 |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CX0u0mIOZ44C&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers may experience deceleration as a force lifting them away from their seats.  Mathematically, there is no separate formula for deceleration, as both are changes in velocity. Each of these accelerations (linear, non-linear, deceleration) might be felt by passengers until their velocity (speed and direction) match that of the car.

== Definition and properties ==

===Average acceleration===
[[File:Acceleration as derivative of velocity along trajectory.svg|right|thumb|Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. At any point on a trajectory, the magnitude of the acceleration is given by the rate of change of velocity in both magnitude and direction at that point. The true acceleration at time ''t'' is found in the limit as [[time interval]] ''Δt'' → 0 of ''Δ'''''v'''/''Δt'']]

An object's average acceleration over a period of [[time in physics|time]] is its change in [[velocity]] &lt;math&gt;( \Delta \mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt; divided by the duration of the period &lt;math&gt;( \Delta t)&lt;/math&gt;. Mathematically,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\bar{a}} = \frac{\Delta \mathbf{v}}{\Delta t}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Instantaneous acceleration===
[[File:1-D kinematics.svg|thumb|right|'''From bottom to top''': {{bulleted list
 | an acceleration function ''a''(''t'');
 | the integral of the acceleration is the velocity function ''v''(''t'');
 | and the integral of the velocity is the distance function ''s''(''t'').
}}]]
Instantaneous acceleration, meanwhile, is the [[limit of a function|limit]] of the average acceleration over an [[infinitesimal]] interval of time. In the terms of [[calculus]], instantaneous acceleration is the [[derivative]] of the velocity vector with respect to time:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \lim_{{\Delta t}\to 0} \frac{\Delta \mathbf{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

(Here and elsewhere, if [[Rectilinear motion|motion is in a straight line]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities can be substituted by [[Scalar (physics)|scalars]] in the equations.)

It can be seen that the [[integral]] of the acceleration function {{math|''a''(''t'')}} is the velocity function {{math|''v''(''t'')}}; that is, the area under the curve of an acceleration vs. time ({{math|''a''}} vs. {{math|''t''}}) graph corresponds to velocity.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} =  \int \mathbf{a} \  dt&lt;/math&gt;

Given the fact that acceleration is defined as the derivative of velocity, {{math|'''v'''}}, with respect to time {{math|''t''}} and velocity is defined as the derivative of position, {{math|'''x'''}}, with respect to time, acceleration can be thought of as the [[second derivative]] of {{math|'''x'''}} with respect to {{math|''t''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} =  \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2\mathbf{x}}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Units===
Acceleration has the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of velocity (L/T) divided by time, i.e., [[length|L]]/[[time|T]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of acceleration is the [[metre per second squared]] (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); this can be called more meaningfully &quot;metre per second per second&quot;, as the velocity in metres per second changes by the acceleration value, every second.

===Other forms===
An object moving in a circular motion&amp;mdash;such as a satellite orbiting the earth&amp;mdash;is accelerating due to the change of direction of motion, although the magnitude (speed) may be constant. When an object is executing such a motion where it changes direction, but not speed, it is said to be undergoing ''centripetal'' (directed towards the center) acceleration. Oppositely, a change in the speed of an object, but not its direction of motion, is a ''tangential'' acceleration.

[[Proper acceleration]], the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall condition, is measured by an instrument called an [[accelerometer]].

In [[classical mechanics]], for a body with constant mass, the (vector) acceleration of the body's center of mass is proportional to the net [[force]] vector (i.e., sum of all forces) acting on it ([[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a} \quad \to \quad \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{F}/m&lt;/math&gt;
where '''F''' is the net force acting on the body, ''m'' is  the [[mass]] of the body, and '''a''' is the center-of-mass acceleration. As speeds approach the [[speed of light]], [[Special relativity|relativistic effects]] become increasingly large and acceleration becomes less.

== Tangential and centripetal acceleration ==
[[File:Oscillating pendulum.gif|thumb|left|An oscillating pendulum, with velocity and acceleration marked. It experiences both tangential and centripetal acceleration.]]
[[File:Acceleration components.JPG|right|thumb|Components of acceleration for a curved motion. The tangential component '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is due to the change in speed of traversal, and points along the curve in the direction of the velocity vector (or in the opposite direction). The normal component (also called centripetal component for circular motion) '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is due to the change in direction of the velocity vector and is normal to the trajectory, pointing toward the center of curvature of the path.]]
{{see also|Centripetal force#Local coordinates|l1=Local coordinates}}

The velocity of a particle moving on a curved path as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of time can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} (t) =v(t) \frac {\mathbf{v}(t)}{v(t)} = v(t) \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(t) , &lt;/math&gt;

with ''v''(''t'') equal to the speed of travel along the path, and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t} = \frac {\mathbf{v}(t)}{v(t)} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

a [[Differential geometry of curves#Tangent vector|unit vector tangent]] to the path pointing in the direction of motion at the chosen moment in time. Taking into account both the changing speed ''v(t)'' and the changing direction of '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;, the acceleration of a particle moving on a curved path can be written using the [[chain rule]] of differentiation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChainRule.html|title= Chain Rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the product of two functions of time as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{3}
\mathbf{a} &amp; = \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} \\
           &amp; =  \frac{\mathrm{d}v }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t} +v(t)\frac{d \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}}{dt} \\
           &amp; = \frac{\mathrm{d}v }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}+ \frac{v^2}{r}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}\ , \\
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the  unit (inward) [[Differential geometry of curves#Normal or curvature vector|normal vector]] to the particle's trajectory (also called ''the principal normal''), and '''r''' is its instantaneous [[Curvature#Curvature of plane curves|radius of curvature]] based upon the [[Osculating circle#Mathematical description|osculating circle]] at time ''t''. These components are called the [[tangential acceleration]] and the normal or radial acceleration (or centripetal acceleration in circular motion, see also [[circular motion]] and [[centripetal force]]).

== Special cases ==

===Uniform acceleration===
[[File:Strecke und konstante Beschleunigung.png|thumb|Calculation of the speed difference for a uniform acceleration.]]
''Uniform'' or ''constant'' acceleration is a type of motion in which the [[velocity]] of an object changes by an equal amount in every equal time period.

A frequently cited example of uniform acceleration is that of an object in [[free fall]] in a uniform gravitational field. The acceleration of a falling body in the absence of resistances to motion is dependent only on the [[gravitational field]] strength ''[[standard gravity|g]]'' (also called ''acceleration due to gravity''). By [[Newton's Second Law]] the [[force]], ''F'', acting on a body is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = m  \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the simple algebraic properties of constant acceleration in the one-dimensional case (that is, the case of acceleration aligned with the initial velocity), there are simple formulas relating the quantities [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] ''s'', initial [[velocity]] ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, final velocity ''v'', acceleration ''a'', and [[time in physics|time]] ''t'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics for you: revised national curriculum edition for GCSE |author=Keith Johnson |publisher=Nelson Thornes |year=2001 |edition=4th |page=135 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D4nrQDzq1jkC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=suvat#v=onepage&amp;q=suvat&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7487-6236-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v = v_0 + a t &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; s = v_0 t+ \frac{1}{2} at^2 = \frac{v_0+v}{2}t &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; |v|^2= |v_0|^2 + 2 \, a \cdot s &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = displacement

:&lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; = initial velocity

:&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; = final velocity

:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; = uniform acceleration

:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = time.

In the case of uniform acceleration of an object that is initially moving in a direction not aligned with the acceleration, the motion can be resolved into two orthogonal parts, one of constant velocity and the other according to the above equations.  As [[Galileo]] showed, the net result is parabolic motion, as in the trajectory of a cannonball, neglecting air resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding physics |author=David C. Cassidy, Gerald James Holton, and F. James Rutherford |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-387-98756-9 |page=146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPsKvL_ATygC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=parabolic+arc+uniform-acceleration+galileo#v=onepage&amp;q=parabolic%20arc%20uniform-acceleration%20galileo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circular motion===
Uniform [[circular motion]], that is constant speed along a circular path, is an example of a body experiencing acceleration resulting in velocity of a constant magnitude but change of direction. In this case, because the direction of the object's motion is constantly changing, being tangential to the circle, the object's linear [[velocity]] vector also changes, but its speed does not. This acceleration is a radial acceleration since it is always directed toward the centre of the circle and takes the magnitude:

:&lt;math&gt; \textrm{a} = {{v^2} \over {r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the object's linear [[speed]] along the circular path. Equivalently, the radial acceleration vector (&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {a}&lt;/math&gt;) may be calculated from the object's [[angular velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {a}= {-\omega^2}  \mathbf {r} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt; is a vector directed from the centre of the circle and equal in magnitude to the radius. The negative shows that the acceleration vector is directed towards the centre of the circle (opposite to the radius).

The acceleration and the net force acting on a body in uniform circular motion are directed ''toward'' the centre of the circle; that is, it is [[centripetal force|centripetal]]. Whereas the so-called '[[centrifugal force]]' appearing to act outward on the body is really a [[pseudo force]] experienced in the [[frame of reference]] of the body in circular motion, due to the body's [[linear momentum]] at a tangent to the circle.

With nonuniform circular motion, i.e., the speed along the curved path changes, a transverse acceleration is produced equal to the rate of change of the angular speed around the circle times the radius of the circle. That is,

:&lt;math&gt; a = r \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

The transverse (or tangential) acceleration is directed at right angles to the radius vector and takes the sign of the [[angular acceleration]] (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

== Relation to relativity ==

===Special relativity===
{{main|Special relativity}}
The special theory of relativity describes the behavior of objects traveling relative to other objects at speeds approaching that of light in a vacuum. [[Newtonian mechanics]] is exactly revealed to be an approximation to reality, valid to great accuracy at lower speeds. As the relevant speeds increase toward the speed of light, acceleration no longer follows classical equations.

As speeds approach that of light, the acceleration produced by a given force decreases, becoming infinitesimally small as light speed is approached; an object with mass can approach this speed [[asymptotically]], but never reach it.

===General relativity===
{{main|General relativity}}
Unless the state of motion of an object is known, it is totally impossible to distinguish whether an observed force is due to [[gravity]] or to acceleration—gravity and inertial acceleration have identical effects. [[Albert Einstein]] called this the [[principle of equivalence]], and said that only observers who feel no force at all—including the force of gravity—are justified in concluding that they are not accelerating.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Greene, ''[[The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality]]'', page 67.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32808">In [[physics]], '''jerk''', also known as '''jolt''', '''surge''', or '''lurch''', is the rate of change of [[acceleration]]; that is, the [[derivative]] of acceleration with respect to time, and as such the [[second derivative]] of [[velocity]], or the third derivative of [[position (vector)|position]]. Jerk is defined by any of the following equivalent expressions:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec j(t)=\frac {\mathrm{d} \vec a(t)} {\mathrm{d}t}=\dot {\vec a}(t)=\frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \vec v(t)} {\mathrm{d}t^2}=\ddot{\vec v}(t)=\frac {\mathrm{d}^3 \vec r(t)} {\mathrm{d}t^3}=\overset{...}{\vec r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\vec a&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; is velocity,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec r&lt;/math&gt; is position,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{t}&lt;/math&gt; is time.

Jerk is a vector, and there is no generally used term to describe its [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] magnitude (more precisely, its [[Inner_product_space#Norms_on_inner_product_spaces|norm]], e.g. &quot;speed&quot; as the norm of the velocity vector).

According to the result of [[dimensional analysis]] of jerk, [length/time&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;], the [[SI base unit|SI units]] are m/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (or m·s&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). There is no universal agreement on the symbol for jerk, but &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is commonly used. [[Newton's notation]] for the time derivative (&lt;math&gt;\dot{ a},\;\ddot{ v},\;\overset{...}{r}&lt;/math&gt;) is also applied.

The fourth derivative of position, equivalent to the first derivative of jerk, is [[jounce]].

Because of involving third derivatives, in [[mathematics]] differential equations of the form
:: &lt;math&gt;J\left(\overset{...}{x},\ddot{x},\dot {x},x\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
are called ''jerk equations''. It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first order, ordinary, non-linear differential equations, is in a certain sense the minimal setting for solutions showing [[Chaos theory|chaotic behaviour]]. This motivates mathematical interest in ''jerk systems''. Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are accordingly called ''hyperjerk systems''.

==Physiological effects and human perception of physical jerk==
The smooth movement and also the rest state of an alert human body is achieved by balancing the forces of several [[Antagonist (muscle)|antagonistic muscles]] which are controlled across [[Nervous system|neural paths]] by the brain (for directed movement) or sometimes across [[reflex arc]]s. In balancing some given force (holding or pulling up a weight, e.g.) the [[postcentral gyrus]] establishes a [[control loop]] to achieve this [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] by adjusting the [[Muscle contraction|muscular tension]] according to the sensed position of the actuator. If the load changes faster than the current state of this control loop is capable of supplying a suitable, [[Transient response|adaptive response]], the balance cannot be upheld, because the tensioned muscles cannot relax or build up tension fast enough and overshoot in either direction, until the neural control loop manages to take control again. Of course the time to react is limited from below by physiological bounds and also depends on the [[attention]] level of the brain: an ''expected'' change will be stabilized faster than a ''sudden'' drop or increase of load.

So passengers in transportation, who need this time to adapt to stress changes and to adjust their muscle tension, or else suffer conditions such as [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]], can be safely subjected both only to a less than maximum acceleration, and to a less than maximum jerk,&lt;ref name=&quot;thetartan2007&quot;/&gt; so to avoid loss of control over their body motion thereby endangering their physical integrity.  Even where occupant safety is not an issue, excessive jerk may result in an uncomfortable ride on [[elevator]]s, [[tram]]s, and the like, and engineers expend considerable design effort to minimize &quot;jerky motion&quot;.

Since forces, changing at a suitable rate in time (that is, ''suitable'' jerk) are the cause of vibrations, and vibrations significantly impair the quality of transportation, there is good reason to simply ''minimize'' jerk in transportation vehicles.

As an everyday example, driving in a car can show effects of acceleration and jerk. The more experienced drivers accelerate smoothly, but beginners provide a ''jerky'' ride.
* Changing gears, especially with a foot-operated clutch, offers well-known examples: although the accelerating force is bounded by the engine power, an inexperienced driver lets you experience severe jerk, because of intermittent force closure over the clutch.
* High-powered sports cars offer the feeling of being pressed into the cushioning, but this is the force of the acceleration. Only in the very first moments, when the torque of the engine grows with the rotational speed, the acceleration grows remarkably and a slight whiplash effect is noticeable in the neck, mostly masked by the jerk of gear switching.
* The beginning of an emergency braking lets the body whip forward faster than the achieved acceleration value alone would accomplish, and a collision does so to an even greater degree, but quantitative testing on living humans (and, for some, on animals) runs afoul of ethical concerns, with the effect that [[cadaver]]s or [[Crash test dummy|crash test dummies]] must be substituted, which, of course, do not show the physiological reactions to jerk caused by an active control loop described above.
* A highly reproducible experiment to demonstrate jerk is as follows: Brake a car starting at a ''modest'' speed in two different ways: 
*# apply a constant, modest force on the pedal till the car comes to a halt, only then release the pedal;
*# apply the same, constant, modest force on the pedal, but just before the halt, reduce the force on the pedal, optimally releasing the pedal fully, exactly when the car stops.
:The reason for the by far bigger jerk in the first way to brake is a ''[[Discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]]'' of the acceleration, which is initially at a ''constant'' value, due to the constant force on the pedal, and ''drops to zero'' immediately, when the wheels stop rotating. Note that there would be ''no jerk'' if the car started to move ''backwards'' with the same acceleration. Every experienced driver knows how to start and how to stop braking with low jerk. See also below in the motion profile, segment 7: ''Deceleration ramp-down''.

For some remarks on how the human perception of various motions is organized in the proprioceptors, the vestibular organ and by visual impressions, and how to deceive it, see the article on [[motion simulator]]s.

== Forces and path derivatives ==

=== Position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; itself, zeroth derivative ===
The most prominent force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; associated with the ''position'' of a particle relates via [[Hooke law|Hooke's Law]] to the ''rigid'' stiffness &lt;math&gt;k_r&lt;/math&gt; of a spring.
::&lt;math&gt;F= -k_r x\,&lt;/math&gt;
This is a force opposing the increase in displacement.

=== Speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, magnitude of the first derivative ===
A particle moving in a viscous fluid environment experiences a [[Drag (physics)|drag force]] &lt;math&gt;F_D&lt;/math&gt;, which, depending on the [[Reynolds number]] and its area, ranges between being proportional to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; up to being proportional to &lt;math&gt;v^2&lt;/math&gt; according to the [[drag equation]]:
::&lt;math&gt;F_D\, =\, \tfrac12\, \rho\, v^2\, C_D\, A&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluid,
:&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of the object relative to the fluid,
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area, and
:&lt;math&gt;C_D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[drag coefficient]] – a [[dimensionless number]].
The drag coefficient depends on the scalable shape of the object and on the Reynolds number, which itself depends on the speed.

=== Acceleration ''a'', magnitude of the second derivative ===
The acceleration &lt;math&gt; a&lt;/math&gt; is according to [[Newton's Second Law]]
::&lt;math&gt;F=m\cdot a&lt;/math&gt;
bound to a force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, via the proportionality given by the mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Higher derivatives ===
In [[classical mechanics]] of rigid bodies there are ''no forces'' associated with the higher derivatives of the path, nevertheless not only the physiological effects of jerk, but also oscillations and deformation propagation along and in non-ideally rigid bodies, require various techniques for controlling motion to avoid the resulting destructive forces. It is often reported (where?) that [[NASA]] in designing the [[Hubble Telescope]] not only limited the jerk in their requirement specification, but also the next higher derivative, the [[jounce]].

For a recoil force on accelerating ''charged'' particles emitting radiation, which is proportional to their jerk and the square of their charge, see the [[Abraham–Lorentz force]]. A more advanced theory, applicable in a relativistic and quantum environment, accounting for [[self-energy]] is provided in [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]].

==Jerk in an idealized setting==
In real world environments, because of [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]], [[granularity#Molecular dynamics|granularity]] at least at the [[Planck scale]], i.e. quanta-effects, and other reasons, discontinuities in acceleration do not occur. However, frequently used idealized settings ([[Rigid body|rigid bodies]], smooth representations of paths, no friction, and the like) applied to an also idealized [[point mass]] moving along a [[piecewise]] [[Smooth function|smooth]] and as a whole continuous path, suffice for the phenomenon of a jump-discontinuity in acceleration at the points where the path is not smooth, and accordingly for an unbounded jerk in this simplified model of classical mechanics (see two examples below). Extrapolating from the idealized settings, the effect of jerk in real situations can be qualitatively described, explained and predicted.

The jump-discontinuity in acceleration may be modeled by a [[Dirac delta]] in the jerk, scaled with the height of this jump. Integrating jerk over time generally gives the according acceleration; doing so across such a Dirac delta reconstructs exactly the jump discontinuity in the acceleration belonging to the Dirac delta in the jerk.

Assume a path along a circular arc with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, which [[tangent#Tangent line to a curve|tangentially]] connects to a straight line. The whole path is continuous and its pieces are smooth. Now let a point particle move with constant speed along this path, so its [[acceleration#Tangential and centripetal acceleration|tangential acceleration]] is zero, and consider the acceleration orthogonal to the path: it is zero along the straight part and &lt;math&gt;v^2/r&lt;/math&gt; along the circle ([[acceleration#Tangential and centripetal acceleration|centripetal acceleration]]). This gives a jump-discontinuity in the magnitude of the acceleration by &lt;math&gt;v^2/r&lt;/math&gt;, and the particle undergoes a jerk measured by a Dirac delta scaled with this value, for purely geometric reasons, when it passes the connection of the pieces. See below for a more concrete application.

If we assume an idealized [[Spring (device)|spring]] and idealized, [[friction|kinetic frictional forces]], proportional to the [[normal force]] and directed oppositely to the velocity, there is another example of discontinuous acceleration. Let a mass, connected to an ideal spring, oscillate on a flat, idealized surface with friction. Each time the velocity changes sign (at the maxima of [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]]), the magnitude of the force on the mass, which is the vectorial sum of the spring force and the kinetic frictional force, changes by twice the magnitude of the frictional force, since the spring force is continuous and the frictional force ''reverses'' its direction when the velocity does. Therefore the acceleration jumps by this amount divided by the mass. That is, the mass experiences a discontinuous acceleration and the jerk contains a Dirac delta, each time the mass passes through the (decreasing) maximal displacements, until it comes to a halt, because the static friction force adapts to the residual spring force, establishing equilibrium with zero net force and zero velocity.

The car example relies on the way the [[Vehicle brake|brakes]] operate on a rotating drum or on a disc. As long as the disc rotates the [[brake pad]]s act to decelerate the vehicle via the kinetic frictional forces which create a constant braking [[torque]] on the disk. This decreases the rotation ''linearly'' to zero with ''constant'' angular acceleration, but when the rotation reaches exactly zero, this hitherto constant frictional force ''suddenly'' drops to zero, as well as the torque, and the associated acceleration of the car. This, of course, neglects all effects of tire sliding, dipping of suspension, real deflection of all ideally rigid mechanisms, etc. A sudden drop in acceleration indicates a Dirac delta in the ''physical'' jerk, which is smoothed down by the ''real'' environment, the cumulative effects of which are analogous to damping, to the ''physiologically'' perceived ''jerk''.

Another example of significant jerk, analogous to the first setting, is given by cutting the rope twirling a particle around a center. When the rope is cut, the circular path with non-zero centripetal acceleration changes abruptly to a straight path with suddenly no force in the direction to the former center. Imagine a monomolecular fiber, cut by a laser and you arrive at very high rates of jerk, because of the extremely short cutting time.

== Jerk in rotation ==
[[File:Animiertes Prinzip Malteserkreuzgetriebe 3D.gif|thumbnail|Animation showing a four-position external Geneva drive in operation]]
[[File:Chronogrammes croix malte 4 branches complet.svg|thumbnail|right|Timing diagram over one rev. for angle, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and angular jerk]]

Consider a rotational movement of a rigid body about a fixed axis in an [[inertial frame of reference#Newton's inertial frame of reference|inertial frame]]. The orientation of the solid can be expressed by an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the angular position, from which one can express:

:the [[angular velocity|angular speed]] &lt;math&gt;\omega(t)=\dot\theta(t)=\frac{\mathrm {d}\theta(t)} {\mathrm {d}t}&lt;/math&gt; as the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:the [[angular acceleration]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha(t)=\dot\omega(t)=\frac{\mathrm {d}\omega(t)} {\mathrm {d} t}&lt;/math&gt; as the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;\omega(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

Differentiating the &lt;math&gt;\alpha(t)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to time, defines an angular jerk &lt;math&gt;\zeta(t)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(t) = \dot {\alpha}(t) =\ddot\omega(t) = \overset{...}{ \theta}(t)&lt;/math&gt; .

The angular acceleration corresponds to the quotient of the [[torque]] acting on the body and the [[moment of inertia]] of the body with respect to the momentary axis of rotation. An abrupt change of the torque results in an important angular jerk.

The general case of a rigid body movement in space can be modeled by a kinematic [[Screw theory|screw]], which specifies at each instant one [[pseudovector|(axial) vector]], the angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\vec \Omega(t)&lt;/math&gt; and one [[pseudovector|(polar) vector]], the linear velocity &lt;math&gt;\vec v(t)&lt;/math&gt;. From this the angular acceleration is defined as
:    &lt;math&gt;\vec {\alpha}(t) = \frac {\mathrm {d}} {\mathrm {d} t} \vec {\Omega}(t)= \dot {\vec \Omega}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
and thus the angular jerk
:    &lt;math&gt;\vec \zeta(t) = \frac {\mathrm {d}}{\mathrm {d}t}\vec{\alpha}(t)=\dot{\vec\alpha}(t)&lt;/math&gt; .

Consider for example a [[Geneva drive]], a device for creating an intermittent rotation of the driven wheel (blue) from a continuous rotation of the driving wheel (red). On one cycle of the driving wheel there is a variation of the angular position &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; of the driven wheel by one quarter of a cycle, and a constant angular position on the remainder of the cycle.

Because of the necessary finite thickness of the fork making up the slot for the driving pin this device generates a discontinuity in the angular acceleration &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore an unbounded angular jerk &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; in the driven wheel.

This does not preclude the mechanism from being used in e.g. movie projectors to stepwise transport the film with high reliability (very long life) and just slight noise, since the load is very low - the system drives just that part of the film which is within the corridor of projection, so a very low mass (a few centimeters thin plastic film), with low friction, at a moderate speed (2.4&amp;nbsp;m/s, 8.6&amp;nbsp;km/h) is affected.

To avoid the jerk inherent in a single cam device, a dual cam device can be used instead, bulkier and more expensive, but also quieter. This operates two cams on one axis in continuous rotation and shifting another axle about a fraction of a full revolution. The pictures show a step drive by one sixth and one third rotation, respectively per full revolution of the driving axle. Note that two of the arms of the stepped wheel are always in contact with the double cam, so there is no radial clearance. To follow the detailed operation of the dual cam devices it is advisable to have a look at the enlarged pictures.

Generally, combined contacts may be used to avoid jerk (and also wear and noise) associated with one single follower, e.g. gliding along a slot and thereby changing its contact point from one side of the slot to the other, by using two followers always sliding along the same, one side each.

A force/acceleration acting on an elastically deformable mass will affect a [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] which depends on its [[stiffness]] and the acceleration applied. If the change of this force is slow, the jerk is small, and the propagation of this deformation through the body may be considered instantaneously compared to the change in acceleration. The distorted body acts as if it were in a [[Quasistatic loading|quasi-static regime]]. It is the common thread that only a changing force, i.e. a non-zero jerk, can cause mechanical (or on a charged particle: electromagnetic) waves to be radiated. So for non-zero to high jerk a [[shock wave]] and its [[Wave propagation|propagation]] through the body is to be considered. The left picture shows the propagation of a deformation as a compressional, [[plane wave]] through an elastically deformable material. For angular jerk the deformation waves are arranged [[Jacobi–Anger expansion|circularly]] and cause [[shear stress]] as shown in the picture to the right, which also might cause other [[Normal mode|modes]] of vibration. As usual with waves, one has to consider their reflections along all boundaries and the emerging [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference patterns]], i.e. destructive as well as constructive interference, which may lead to exceeding boundaries of [[structural integrity and failure|structural integrity]]. As a rough estimate the deformation waves result in [[vibration]]s of the whole device and, generally, vibrations cause noise, wear, and, especially in resonance cases, even disruption.

[[File:Acceleration et deformation elastique.svg|thumbnail|left|Pole with massive top]]

The picture to the left shows a massive top bending the elastic pole, to which it is connected, to the left, when the bottom block is accelerated to the right. When the block stops accelerating, the top on the pole will start a ([[Damping|damped]]) oscillation under the regime of the stiffness of the pole. This could make plausible, how a bigger (periodic) jerk might excite a bigger amplitude of the oscillations, because any small oscillations are damped before they get reinforced by another amplitude of the shock wave.

[[File:Chronogrammes loi sinusoidale par partie en vitesse.svg|thumbnail|right|Sinusoidal acceleration profile]]

One can also argue that a ''steeper'' slope of the acceleration, i.e. a bigger jerk, excites bigger wave components in the shockwave with higher frequencies, belonging to higher [[Fourier series|Fourier coefficients]], and so an increased probability of exciting a [[Resonance|resonant mode]].

As a general rule, to reduce the amplitude of excited stress waves, causing vibrations, any motion of massive parts has to be shaped by limiting the jerk, i.e. making the acceleration continuous and keep its slopes as flat as possible. Since the described effects are almost not amenable to abstract models anymore, the various suggested algorithms for reducing vibrations include still higher derivatives such as the [[jounce]] or suggest continuous regimes not only for the acceleration, but also for the jerk. One concept is e.g. shaping the acceleration and deceleration sinusoidal with zero-acceleration in between (see the profile to the right), making the speed look sinusoidal with constant maximal speed, too. The jerk however will remain discontinuous at the points when the acceleration enters and leaves its zero-phases.

== Applied considerations of Jerk ==
Although jerk is not directly involved in Newton's Laws, it has to be considered in [[engineering]] in various places. Normally, only speed and acceleration are used for analysis. For example, the jerk produced by falling from [[outer space]] to the Earth is not particularly useful given the [[gravitational acceleration]] changes very slowly. Sometimes the analysis has to include the jerk for a particular reason.

=== Geometric design of roads and tracks ===
[[File:Easement curve.svg|thumb|widthpx|Easement curve]]

The principles of geometric design apply to the jerk oriented orthogonally to the path of motion, considering the centripetal acceleration, whereas the velocity along the path is assumed to be constant, and so the tangential jerk is zero. Any change in curvature of the path implies non-zero jerk, arising from purely geometric reasons. To avoid the unbounded (centripetal) jerk when moving from a straight path into a curve or vice versa, [[track transition curve]]s are constructed, which limit the jerk by gradually increasing the centripetal acceleration, i.e. the curvature, to the value that belongs to the radius of the circle and the speed of travel. The theoretical optimum is achieved by the [[Euler spiral]], which linearly increases the acceleration, i.e. minimal constant jerk. As a design rule a maximum value of 0.5&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and for convenience purposes a value of 0.35&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are recommended in railway design. The picture shows a piece of an Euler spiral leading as track transition curve from a straight line to an arc of a circle. In the real scenario the plane of the track is inclined in the course of the curve and so also this vertical acceleration of the necessary lifting of the center of mass of the rail car has to be considered to minimize the wear on the embankment and the tracks by following a slightly different curve. This has been patented as the ''Wiener Kurve'' (Viennese Curve).&lt;ref&gt;https://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?window=1&amp;space=menu&amp;content=treffer&amp;action=pdf&amp;docid=AT000000412975B&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mplusm.at/ifg/download/Presle-05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roller coaster]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;thetartan2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetartan.org/2007/4/16/scitech/work |title=How Things Work: Roller Coasters - The Tartan Online |publisher=Thetartan.org |date=2007-04-16 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; are of course also subject to these design considerations, when rolling into a loop. The acceleration values range up to 4g in this environment and it would not be possible to ride loopings without track transitions, as well as one cannot smoothly drive along a figure eight consisting of circles. Any '''S'''-shaped curve must contain some jerk-reducing transition.

=== Motion control ===
In [[motion control]] the focus is on straight linear motion, where the need is to move a system from one steady position to another (point-to-point motion). So effectively, the jerk resulting from tangential acceleration is under control. Prominent applications are elevators in people transportation, and the support of tools in machining. It is reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howkins|first1=Roger E.|title=Elevator Ride Quality - The Human Ride Experience|url=http://www.lift-report.de/index.php/news/176/368/Elevator-Ride-Quality|publisher=VFZ-Verlag für Zielgruppeninformationen GmbH &amp; Co. KG|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that most passengers rate a vertical jerk of 2.0&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in a lift ride as acceptable, 6.0&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; as intolerable and for a hospital environment 0.7&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is suggested. In any case, limiting jerk is considered essential for riding convenience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schindler.com/content/ie/internet/en/mobility-solutions/products/elevators/schindler-5300/_jcr_content/rightPar/downloadlist/downloadList/3_1340031711862.download.asset.3_1340031711862/05SML9039_Inform_Sheet_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ISO&amp;nbsp;18&amp;nbsp;738&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ISO 18738-1:2012|title=Measurement of ride quality -- Part 1: Lifts (elevators)|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=54395|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines how to measure elevator ride quality with respect to jerk, acceleration, vibrations and noise, but does not venture into defining what are different levels of elevator ride quality.

Achieving the shortest possible transition time, thereby not exceeding given limit magnitudes for speed, acceleration, and jerk, will result in a third-order motion profile, with quadratic ramping and de-ramping phases in the velocity, as illustrated below:

[[File:Schematic diagram of Jerk, Acceleration, and Speed.png|center|This picture shows a schematic diagram of jerk, acceleration, and speed, assuming all three are limited in their magnitude, when linearly going from one point to another, which are sufficiently far apart to reach the respective maxima.]]

This motion profile consists of up to seven segments defined by the following:
# '''acceleration build-up''': ''limit jerk'' implies ''linear increase'' of acceleration to the ''limit acceleration'', ''quadratic increase'' of speed
# '''limit acceleration:''' implies ''zero jerk'' and ''linear increase'' of speed
# '''acceleration ramp-down:''' approaching the desired limit velocity with negative limit jerk, i.e. ''linear decrease'' of acceleration, ''(negative) quadratic increase'' of speed
# '''limit speed:''' implies ''zero jerk'' and ''zero acceleration''
# '''deceleration build-up:''' ''limit negative jerk'' implies ''linear decrease'' of acceleration to the ''negative limit acceleration'', ''(negative) quadratic decrease'' of speed 
# '''limit deceleration:''' implies ''zero jerk'' and ''linear decrease'' of speed
# '''deceleration ramp-down:''' ''limit jerk'' implies ''linear increase'' of acceleration to zero, ''quadratic decrease'' of speed, approaching the desired position at zero speed and zero acceleration

The time allotted to segment 4, concerning constant velocity, is to be varied to suit the distance between the two positions. If the initial and final positions are so close together that a complete omission of this 4. segment does not suffice, the segments 2. and 6. with constant acceleration are equally reduced and the limit of speed would not be reached in this variant of the profile. If also this does not reduce the crossed distance sufficiently, in a next step the ramping segments 1., 3., 5., and 7. are to be shortened by an equal amount and the limit of acceleration is not reached, also.

There are also other strategies to design a motion profile, e.g. minimizing the square of the jerk for a given transition time, to be selected according to the varying applications in machines, people movers, chain hoists, automotive industries, robot design, and many more. For a sinusoidal-shaped acceleration profile, with sinusoidal-shaped speed and bounded jerk also, see above.

=== Jerk in manufacturing ===
Jerk is also important to consider in [[manufacturing]] processes. Rapid changes in acceleration of a cutting tool can lead to premature tool wear and result in uneven cuts. This is why modern [[motion controller]]s include jerk limitation features.
In mechanical engineering, jerk is considered, in addition to velocity and acceleration, in the development of cam profiles because of [[tribology|tribological]] implications and the ability of the actuated body to follow the cam profile without [[Machining vibrations|chatter]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, G., &quot;Making the Cam&quot;, ''Race Engine Technology '' 10, September/October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
Jerk must be often considered when the excitation of vibrations is a concern. A device that measures jerk is called a &quot;jerkmeter&quot;.

If the tube were connected directly to the power line, the falling tube voltage would cause more and more current to flow, until it destroyed itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aluf&quot; /&gt; To prevent this, fluorescent tubes are connected to the power line through a ''[[electrical ballast|ballast]]''. The ballast adds positive [[electrical impedance|impedance]] (AC resistance) to the circuit to counteract the negative resistance of the tube, limiting the current.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair&quot; /&gt;]]

In [[electronics]], '''negative resistance''' ('''NR''') is a property of some [[electrical circuit]]s and devices in which an increase in [[voltage]] across the device's terminals results in a decrease in [[electric current]] through it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amos&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v/i\,&lt;/math&gt;, and ''differential resistance'', the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta v/\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;. The term negative resistance refers to '''negative differential resistance (NDR)''', &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can [[amplifier|amplify]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Aluf&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suzuki&quot;&gt;&quot;''In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify.''&quot; {{cite journal

In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as [[transistor]]s and [[op amp]]s with [[positive feedback]] can have negative differential resistance. These are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] and [[active filter]]s.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive &quot;ohmic&quot; resistances usually encountered in [[electric circuit]]s. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilmore&quot; /&gt; Therefore, there is no real &quot;negative resistor&quot; analogous to a positive [[resistor]], which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

==How it works==
One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions that current and electric power flow between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:
{|
|-
| The voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the [[passive sign convention]]; positive [[conventional current]] is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power '''''P''''' flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traylor&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Glisson&quot; /&gt; This applies to both DC and AC current. The diagram shows the directions for positive values of the variables. || [[File:Passive sign convention.svg|140px]]
|-
| In a '''positive static resistance''', &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, so '''''v''''' and '''''i''''' have the same sign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chua2&quot;&gt;{{cite book

  | id = 
  | isbn = 0071166505}}, [http://www.webcitation.org/6ZzbS4wuW archived]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, from the passive sign convention above, conventional current (positive charge) flows through the device from the positive to the negative terminal, in the direction of the [[electric field]] '''''E''''' (decreasing [[electric potential|potential]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Traylor&quot; /&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt; so the charges lose [[potential energy]] doing [[work (physics)|work]] on the device, and electric power flows from the circuit into the device,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chua2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karady&quot; /&gt; where it is converted to heat or some other form of energy ''(yellow)''. If AC voltage is applied, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle i&lt;/math&gt; periodically reverse direction, but the instantaneous &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle i&lt;/math&gt; always flows from the higher potential to the lower potential. || [[File:Electric load animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a '''power source''', &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v/i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Simin&quot; /&gt; so &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle i&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chua2&quot; /&gt; This means current is forced to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simin&quot; /&gt; The charges gain potential energy, so power flows out of the device into the circuit:&lt;ref name=&quot;Simin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chua2&quot; /&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P\;=\;vi\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Work ''(yellow)'' must be done on the charges by some power source in the device to make them move in this direction against the force of the electric field. || [[File:Electric power source animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a passive '''negative differential resistance''', &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r_\text{diff}\;=\;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, only the ''AC component'' of the current flows in the reverse direction. The static resistance is positive&lt;ref name=&quot;Shanefield&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gottlieb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesurf&quot; /&gt; so the current flows from positive to negative: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. But the current (rate of charge flow) decreases as the voltage increases. So when a time-varying (AC) voltage is applied in addition to a DC voltage ''(right)'', the time-varying current &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; and voltage &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; components have opposite signs, so &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_\text{AC}\;=\;\Delta v\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghadiri&quot; /&gt; This means the instantaneous &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; flows through the device in the direction of increasing &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt;, so AC power flows out of the device into the circuit. The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghadiri&quot; /&gt; enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suzuki&quot; /&gt; || [[File:Negative differential resistance animation.gif|150px]]

He has a black box with two terminals, labelled &quot;−10 kilohms&quot; and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional ''negative'' current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify.

[[File:Battery and resistor circuit 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law|KVL]], the static resistance of a power source (''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Morecroft&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliyannis&quot; /&gt; ]]

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current '''''v/i''''' at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morecroft&quot; /&gt; For electric power ([[potential energy]]) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, [[conventional current]] (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Simin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler&quot; /&gt; So the direction of the instantaneous current is ''out'' of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the [[passive sign convention]] so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {v}{i} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This can also be proved from [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Simin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morecroft&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = iv = i^2 R_\mathrm{static} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_\text{static}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chua2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot; /&gt; Whether or not this quantity is referred to as &quot;resistance&quot; when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aluf&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chua2&quot; /&gt; but this is not to be regarded as &quot;resistance&quot; in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to [[conservation of energy]] it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit ''(right)''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morecroft&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deliyannis&quot; /&gt;

[[Work (physics)|Work]] must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so [[conservation of energy]] requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aluf&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Simin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solymar&quot;&gt;{{cite book

This derives a slightly more complicated circuit where the two voltage divider resistors are different to allow scaling, but it reduces to the text circuit by setting ''R2'' and ''R3'' in the source to ''R1'' in the text, and ''R1'' in source to ''Z'' in the text. The ''I–V'' curve is the same.&lt;/ref&gt; will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

==Negative differential resistance==
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the ''I–V'' curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesurf&quot; /&gt;

The reason is that in [[linear circuit]]s if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by [[hysteresis]] the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an [[astable multivibrator]], and the [[bistability|bistable]] region is considered the &quot;stable&quot; one. This article uses the former &quot;linear&quot; definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter &quot;switching circuit&quot; definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;'''N'''&quot; type): In this type the current is a [[Single-valued function|single valued]], [[continuous function]] of the voltage, but the voltage is a [[multivalued function]] of the current.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kumar&quot; /&gt; In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter &quot;N&quot;. As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then increases again.

Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r&lt;/math&gt;. For stability &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R\,&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler&quot; /&gt; Using the formula for a [[voltage divider]], the AC output voltage is&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_o = \frac{-r}{R-r}v_i = \frac{r}{r-R}v_i \,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;so the [[voltage gain]] is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;G_v = \frac{r}{r-R} \,&lt;/math&gt;
In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r - R\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than the resistance of the diode alone &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r\,&lt;/math&gt; so the AC output voltage &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_o&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the input  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_i&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage gain &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G_v\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, and increases without limit as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the [[superposition principle]] the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V_{bias},\;I_{bias}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and an AC component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta v,\;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; 
Since a positive change in voltage &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; causes a ''negative'' change in current &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° [[out of phase]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Radmanesh&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler&quot;&gt;{{cite web

With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an [[amplifier]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler&quot; /&gt; or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. Unlike in a [[two port]] amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals ([[two port|port]]) as the input signal enters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golio2&quot; /&gt;

In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesurf&quot; /&gt; the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesurf&quot; /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;|P_\text{AC}| \le I_\text{bias} V_\text{bias} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing AC power with no power input.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aluf&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesurf&quot; /&gt; The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the AC power out.

However, because of the different shapes of the curves, the condition for stability is different for VCNR and CCNR types of negative resistance:&lt;ref name=&quot;Golio2&quot;&gt;Golio (2000) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=UIHMnx0k9oAC&amp;pg=SA7-PA29&amp;dq=golio+%22open+circuit+stable The RF and Microwave Handbook]'', pp. 7.25–7.26, 7.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crisson2&quot;&gt;Crisson (1931) ''[http://www3.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol10-1931/articles/bstj10-3-485.pdf Negative Impedances and the Twin 21-Type Repeater]'', pp. 488–492&lt;/ref&gt;

The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_S - IR\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) occur where the DC load line intersects the ''I–V'' curve. For stability&lt;ref name=&quot;Krugman&quot; /&gt;
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}}, such as a [[voltage source]].
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}} such as a [[current source]], or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; facing the device. Increasing &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions ''(see diagrams)'', depending on &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kumar&quot; /&gt;
*'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;Stable region (green)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the ''I–V'' curve at one point ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kumar&quot; /&gt; For nonreactive circuits it is a [[Stability theory|stable equilibrium]] ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance [[amplifier]]s operate in this region. However, due to [[hysteresis]], with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear [[relaxation oscillator]] ([[astable multivibrator]]) or a [[Monostable Multivibrator|monostable multivibrator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gottlieb2&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22negative+resistance Gottlieb 1997 ''Practical Oscillator Handbook'', pp. 105–108]&lt;/ref&gt;
**VCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
**CCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''Unstable point''' (Line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): When &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_L\;=\;r&lt;/math&gt; the load line is tangent to the ''I–V'' curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the ''jω'' axis), so it is unstable and with a [[tuned circuit]] can oscillate. Linear [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to ''eventual passivity'' the negative resistance ''r'' decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where&lt;ref name=&quot;Nahin&quot; /&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r\;=\;R_L&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Bistable region (red)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): In this region the load line can intersect the ''I–V'' curve at three points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kumar&quot; /&gt; The center point (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point of [[unstable equilibrium]] (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[stable equilibria]]. So with correct biasing the circuit can be [[Bistability|bistable]], it will converge to one of the two points ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s ([[bistable multivibrator]]s) and [[Schmidt trigger]]s operate in this region. 
**VCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt; 
**CCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;

If an [[LC circuit]] is connected across the input of a positive feedback amplifier like that above, the negative differential input resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_\text{if}&lt;/math&gt; can cancel the positive loss resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r_\text{loss}&lt;/math&gt; inherent in the tuned circuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters&quot;&gt;this property was often called &quot;resistance neutralization&quot; in the days of vacuum tubes, see {{cite journal

===Q enhancement===
A tuned circuit connected to a negative resistance which cancels some but not all of its parasitic loss resistance (so &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |R_\text{if}|\;&lt;\;r_\text{loss}&lt;/math&gt;) will not oscillate, but the negative resistance will decrease the damping in the circuit (moving its [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s toward the ''jω'' axis), increasing its [[Q factor]] so it has a narrower [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and more [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Li&quot;&gt;{{cite conference

A common example of an &quot;active resistance&quot; circuit is the [[negative impedance converter]] (NIC)&lt;ref name=&quot;HorowitzVideo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hickman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Linvill&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \,&lt;/math&gt;
So if a voltage &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v\,&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied &quot;backwards&quot; across &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt;, causing current to flow through it out of the input.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hickman&quot; /&gt; The current is
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \, &lt;/math&gt;
So the input impedance to the circuit is&lt;ref name=&quot;Muthuswamy&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The circuit converts the impedance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt; to its negative. If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt; is a resistor of value &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt;, within the linear range of the op amp &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V_\text{S}/2\;&lt;\;v\;&lt;\;-V_\text{S}/2&lt;/math&gt; the input impedance acts like a linear &quot;negative resistor&quot; of value &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle -R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hickman&quot; /&gt; The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component.

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt; in the above circuit with a capacitor {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C&lt;/math&gt;) or inductor (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle L&lt;/math&gt;)}}, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghadiri&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hickman&quot; /&gt; A negative capacitance will have an ''I–V'' relation and an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_\text{C}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to ''discharge''; its voltage will ''decrease''. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an ''I–V'' characteristic and impedance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_\text{L}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of 
:&lt;math&gt;v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \,&lt;/math&gt; 
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hickman&quot; /&gt; NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hickman&quot; /&gt; Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance&lt;ref name=&quot;Hickman&quot; /&gt; Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are &quot;non-Foster&quot; circuits which violate [[Foster's reactance theorem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The common [[Gunn diode]] oscillator ''(circuit diagrams)''&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesurf&quot; /&gt; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode ''D'' has voltage controlled (&quot;N&quot; type) negative resistance and the voltage source &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle dv/di\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt;. The [[choke (electronics)|choke]] ''RFC'' prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesurf&quot; /&gt; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle LC&lt;/math&gt;, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] gives a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesurf&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesurf&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the current through the circuit, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, varies with time about the DC [[Q point]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle I_\text{bias}&lt;/math&gt;. When started from a nonzero initial current &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle i(t)\;=\;i_0&lt;/math&gt; the current oscillates [[sinusoidal]]ly at the [[resonant frequency]] '''''ω''''' of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing [[exponential function|exponentially]], depending on the value of '''''α'''''. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r&lt;/math&gt;, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesurf&quot; /&gt;
#[[File:Sinusoid decreasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &lt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solymar&quot; /&gt; So the circuit does not oscillate.
#[[File:Sinusoid constant amplitude.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles on '''''jω''''' axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solymar&quot; /&gt; This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#[[File:Sinusoid increasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &gt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solymar&quot; /&gt; This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellinger&quot; /&gt; A widely used rule of thumb is to make &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R\;=\;r/3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kung2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r&lt;/math&gt; to be the &quot;average&quot; resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R\;-\;r&lt;/math&gt; and the damping &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesurf&quot; /&gt;

In circuits in which &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; is far below &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r&lt;/math&gt;, the swing extends further into the nonlinear part of the curve, the clipping distortion of the output sine wave is more severe,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kung2&quot; /&gt; and the frequency will be increasingly dependent on the supply voltage.

*'''Negative resistance (voltage controlled) oscillator:''' Since VCNR (&quot;N&quot; type) devices require a low impedance bias and are stable for load impedances less than ''r'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Krugman&quot; /&gt; the ideal oscillator circuit for this device has the form shown at top right, with a voltage source ''V''&lt;sub&gt;bias&lt;/sub&gt; to bias the device into its negative resistance region, and [[RLC circuit|parallel resonant circuit]] load ''LC''. The resonant circuit has high impedance only at its resonant frequency, so the circuit will be unstable and oscillate only at that frequency. 
[[File:Negative resistance oscillator circuit CCNR.svg|right|160px]]
*'''Negative conductance (current controlled) oscillator:''' CCNR (&quot;S&quot; type) devices, in contrast, require a high impedance bias and are stable for load impedances greater than ''r''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krugman&quot; /&gt; The ideal oscillator circuit is like that at bottom right, with a current source bias ''I''&lt;sub&gt;bias&lt;/sub&gt; (which may consist of a voltage source in series with a large resistor) and series resonant circuit ''LC''. The series LC circuit has low impedance only at its resonant frequency and so will only oscillate there.

===Conditions for oscillation===
Most oscillators are more complicated than the Gunn diode example, since both the active device and the load may have reactance (''X'') as well as resistance (''R''). Modern negative resistance oscillators are designed by a [[frequency domain]] technique due to K.

:&lt;math&gt;R_N \le -R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;X_N = -X_L \,&lt;/math&gt;
For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellinger&quot; /&gt;

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the [[reflection coefficient]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank&quot; /&gt; The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, while that of the resonator part &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Räisänen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohde&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]] for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellinger&quot; /&gt; so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurokawa&quot; /&gt; which are often used instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maas&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellinger&quot; /&gt;

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make [[amplifier]]s, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golio2&quot; /&gt; Because negative resistance devices have only one ''port'' (two terminals), unlike [[two-port network|two-port]] devices such as [[transistor]]s, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iniewski&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Golio2&quot; /&gt; Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is ''bilateral''; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golio2&quot; /&gt; To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] devices such as [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s and [[directional coupler]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golio2&quot; /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A circulator is a [[Reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] component with three [[two port|ports]] (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode ''N'' is attached through a filter ''F'' to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing &quot;reflected&quot; amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the input and output [[transmission line]]s, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter ''F'' is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Linkhart&quot; /&gt;

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
The output power from the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[power gain]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G_P&lt;/math&gt; of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient&lt;ref name=&quot;Das&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Linkhart&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_\text{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the negative resistance of the diode '''''−r'''''. Assuming the filter is matched to the diode so &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_1\;=\;-X_N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Button&quot; /&gt; then the gain is
:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{P} = |\Gamma|^2 = {(r + R_1)^2 + 4X_N^2 \over (r - R_1)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_1\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Button&quot; /&gt; while a CCNR amplifier is stable for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_1\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the point of oscillation at &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Button&quot; /&gt; This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Willardson&quot; /&gt; contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward &quot;leakage&quot; coupling between circulator ports.

[[Maser]]s and [[parametric amplifier]]s are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linkhart&quot; /&gt;

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in [[switching circuit]]s in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kumar2&quot; /&gt; The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a [[relaxation oscillator]], [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] or memory cell can be built with a single active device,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abraham&quot; /&gt; whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the [[Multivibrator|Eccles-Jordan multivibrator]], requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*''[[Astable multivibrator]]'' – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.
*''[[Monostable Multivibrator|Monostable multivibrator]]'' – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and [[digital counter]]s.

===Arc transmitters===
[[George Francis Fitzgerald]] first realized in 1892 that if the damping resistance in a resonant circuit could be made zero or negative, it would produce continuous oscillations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzgerald&quot;&gt;G.

[[William Duddell]], a student of Ayrton at London Central Technical College, brought Thomson's arc oscillator to public attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nahin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gethemann&quot; /&gt; Due to its negative resistance, the current through an arc was unstable, and [[arc lamp|arc lights]] would often produce hissing, humming, or even howling noises. In 1899, investigating this effect, Duddell connected an [[LC circuit]] across an arc and the negative resistance excited oscillations in the tuned circuit, producing a musical tone from the arc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nahin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gethemann&quot; /&gt; To demonstrate his invention Duddell wired several tuned circuits to an arc and played a tune on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gethemann&quot; /&gt; Duddell's &quot;[[William Duddell|singing arc]]&quot; oscillator was limited to audio frequencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nahin&quot; /&gt; However, in 1903 Danish engineers [[Valdemar Poulsen]] and P.

===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong&quot; /&gt; [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan&quot; /&gt; Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that [[mercury vapor lamp]]s could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&amp;T had used them to build amplifying [[repeater]]s for [[telephone line]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong&quot; /&gt;

In 1918 Albert Hull at [[General Electric|GE]] discovered that [[vacuum tube]]s could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called [[secondary emission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gottlieb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

This represents a current ''away'' from the plate, reducing the plate current.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gottlieb&quot; /&gt; Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a ''decrease'' in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the [[dynatron oscillator]]. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the [[magnetron]] invented by Hull in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilmour&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23845">This is a list of '''[[physical quantity|physical quantities]]'''.

The first table lists the base quantities used in the [[International System of Units]] to define the physical dimension of physical quantities for [[dimensional analysis]]. Note that the angle and solid angle are included in this list but are actually dimensionless quantities. The second table list the other physical quantities.

Note : neither the names nor the symbols used for the physical quantities are international standards. Some quantities are known as several different names such as the magnetic ''B-field'' which known as the ''magnetic flux density'', the ''magnetic induction'' or simply as the ''magnetic field'' depending on the context. Similarly, surface tension can be denoted by either ''σ'', ''γ'' or ''T''. The table usually lists only one name and symbol.

The final column lists some special properties some of the quantities have such as their scaling behavior (i.e. whether the quantity is [[intensive and extensive properties|intensive or extensive]]), their transformation properties (i.e. whether the quantity is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]] or [[tensor]]) or whether the quantity is conserved.

A '''physical property''' is any [[Property (philosophy)|property]] that is [[Measurement|measurable]], whose value describes a state of a [[physical system]]. The changes in the physical properties of a system can be used to describe its transformations or evolutions between its momentary states. Physical properties are often referred to as [[observable]]s. They are not [[modal property|modal properties]].

Physical properties are often characterized as [[intensive and extensive properties]]. An intensive property does not depend on the size or extent of the system, nor on the amount of matter in the object, while an extensive property shows an additive relationship. These classifications are in general only valid in cases when smaller subdivisions of the sample do not interact in some physical or chemical process when combined.

Properties may also be classified with respect to the directionality of their nature. For example, [[isotropy|isotropic]] properties do not change with the direction of observation, and [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] properties do have spatial variance. 

It may be difficult to determine whether a given property is a material property or not.  [[Color]], for example, can be seen and measured; however, what one perceives as color is really an interpretation of the reflective properties of a surface and the light used to illuminate it. In this sense, many ostensibly physical properties are called [[supervenience|supervenient]]. A supervenient property is one which is actual, but is secondary to some underlying reality. This is similar to the way in which objects are supervenient on atomic structure. A cup might have the physical properties of mass, shape, color, temperature, etc., but these properties are supervenient on the underlying atomic structure, which may in turn be supervenient on an underlying quantum structure.

Physical properties are contrasted with [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] which determine the way a material behaves in a [[chemical reaction]].

{{Electromagnetism}}
'''Voltage''', '''electric potential difference''', '''electric pressure ''' or '''electric tension''' (denoted {{math|∆''V''}} or {{math|∆''U''}}) is the difference in [[electric potential energy]] between two points per unit [[electric charge]]. The voltage between two points is equal to the [[Work (electrical)|work]] done per [[Test charge|unit of charge]] against a static [[electric field]] to move the charge between two points and is measured in units of ''[[volt]]s'' (a [[joule]] per [[coulomb]]).

Voltage can be caused by static electric fields, by [[electric current]] through a [[magnetic field]], by time-varying magnetic fields, or some combination of these three.&lt;ref&gt;Demetrius T. Paris and F. Kenneth Hurd, ''Basic Electromagnetic Theory'', McGraw-Hill, New York 1969, ISBN 0-07-048470-8, pp. 512, 546&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Hammond, ''Electromagnetism for Engineers'', p. 135, Pergamon Press 1969 {{OCLC|854336}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[voltmeter]] can be used to measure the voltage (or potential difference) between two points in a system; often a common reference potential such as the [[ground (electricity)|ground]] of the system is used as one of the points. A voltage may represent either a source of energy ([[electromotive force]]), or lost, used, or stored energy ([[voltage drop|potential drop]]).

==Definition==
Given two points in space, A and B, voltage is the difference in [[electric potential]] between those two points. From the definition of electric potential it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V_{BA} = V_B - V_A = - \int_{r_0}^{B} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} - \left( - \int_{r_0}^{A} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt; = \int_{B}^{r_0} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} + \int_{r_0}^{A} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = \int_{B}^{A} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Opfindelsernes bog3 fig282.png|thumb|The electric field around the rod exerts a force on the charged pith ball, in an [[electroscope]]]]
[[File:Electrostatic definition of voltage.svg|thumb|In a static field, the work is independent of the path]]
Voltage is electric potential energy per unit charge, measured in joules per coulomb ( = volts). It is often referred to as &quot;electric potential&quot;, which then must be distinguished from electric potential energy by noting that the &quot;potential&quot; is a &quot;per-unit-charge&quot; quantity. Like mechanical potential energy, the zero of potential can be chosen at any point, so the difference in voltage is the quantity which is physically meaningful. The difference in voltage measured when moving from point A to point B is equal to the work which would have to be done, per unit charge, against the electric field to move the charge from A to B. The voltage between the two ends of a path is the total energy required to move a small electric charge along that path, divided by the magnitude of the charge.  Mathematically this is expressed as the [[line integral]] of the  [[electric field]] and the time rate of change of magnetic field along that path. In the general case, both a static (unchanging) electric field and a dynamic (time-varying) electromagnetic field must be included in determining the voltage between two points.

Historically this quantity has also been called &quot;tension&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Tension | url = http://www.collinslanguage.com/results.aspx?context=3&amp;reversed=False&amp;action=define&amp;homonym=0&amp;text=tension | encyclopedia = CollinsLanguage}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;pressure&quot;. Pressure is now obsolete but tension is still used, for example within the phrase &quot;[[High voltage|high tension]]&quot; (HT) which is commonly used in thermionic valve ([[vacuum tube]]) based electronics.

Voltage is defined so that negatively charged objects are pulled towards higher voltages, while positively charged objects are pulled towards lower voltages. Therefore, the [[conventional current]] in a wire or [[resistor]] always flows from higher voltage to lower voltage. Current can flow from lower voltage to higher voltage, but only when a [[electromotive force|source of energy]] is present to &quot;push&quot; it against the opposing electric field. For example, inside a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], chemical reactions provide the energy needed for current to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.

The electric field is not the only factor determining charge flow in a material, and different materials naturally develop electric potential differences at equilibrium ([[Galvani potential]]s). The electric potential of a material is not even a well defined quantity, since it varies on the subatomic scale. A more convenient definition of 'voltage' can be found instead in the concept of [[Fermi level]]. In this case the voltage between two bodies is the [[thermodynamic work]] required to move a unit of charge between them. This definition is practical since a real voltmeter actually measures this work, not differences in electric potential.

==Volt==
{{main|Volt}}
The volt (symbol: {{math|'''V'''}}) is the [[SI derived unit|derived unit]] for [[electric potential]], [[electric potential difference]] (voltage), and [[electromotive force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-2/table3.html| title = SI Brochure, Table 3 (Section 2.2.2)| accessdate = 2007-07-29|year= 2006| publisher = BIPM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volt is named in honour of the Italian physicist [[Alessandro Volta]]  (1745&amp;ndash;1827), who invented the [[voltaic pile]], possibly the first chemical [[battery (electricity)|battery]].

==Hydraulic analogy==
{{Main|Hydraulic analogy}}

A simple analogy for an [[electric circuit]] is water flowing in a closed circuit of [[pipework]], driven by a mechanical [[pump]].  This can be called a &quot;water circuit&quot;.  Potential difference between two points corresponds to the [[fluid pressure|pressure difference]] between two points. If the pump creates a pressure difference between two points, then water flowing from one point to the other will be able to do work, such as driving a [[turbine]]. Similarly, work can be done by an [[electric current]] driven by the potential difference provided by a [[electric battery|battery]]. For example, the voltage provided by a sufficiently-charged automobile battery can &quot;push&quot; a large current through the windings of an automobile's [[starter motor]]. If the pump isn't working, it produces no pressure difference, and the turbine will not rotate. Likewise, if the automobile's battery is very weak or &quot;dead&quot; (or &quot;flat&quot;), then it will not turn the starter motor.

The hydraulic analogy is a useful way of understanding many electrical concepts. In such a system, the work done to move water is equal to the [[pressure]] multiplied by the [[volume]] of water moved. Similarly, in an electrical circuit, the work done to move electrons or other charge-carriers is equal to &quot;electrical pressure&quot; multiplied by the quantity of electrical charges moved. In relation to &quot;flow&quot;, the larger the &quot;pressure difference&quot; between two points (potential difference or water pressure difference), the greater the flow between them (electric current or water flow). (See &quot;[[Electric power#Definition|Electric power]]&quot;.)

== Applications ==
[[File:US Navy 110315-N-0278E-002 High-voltage electricians from Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Hawaii reconfigure electrical circuitry and.jpg|thumb|upright|Working on [[high voltage]] power lines]]
Specifying a voltage measurement requires explicit or implicit specification of the points across which the voltage is measured.  When using a voltmeter to measure potential difference, one electrical lead of the voltmeter must be connected to the first point, one to the second point.

A common use of the term &quot;voltage&quot; is in describing the voltage dropped across an electrical device (such as a resistor). The [[voltage drop]] across the device can be understood as the difference between measurements at each terminal of the device with respect to a common reference point (or [[ground (electricity)|ground]]). The voltage drop is the difference between the two readings. Two points in an electric circuit that are connected by an ideal conductor without resistance and not within a changing [[magnetic field]] have a voltage of zero. Any two points with the same potential may be connected by a conductor and no current will flow between them.

===Addition of voltages===
The voltage between ''A'' and ''C'' is the sum of the voltage between ''A'' and ''B'' and the voltage between ''B'' and ''C''. The various voltages in a circuit can be computed using [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]].

When talking about [[alternating current]] (AC) there is a difference between instantaneous voltage and average voltage. Instantaneous voltages can be added for [[direct current]] (DC) and AC, but average voltages can be meaningfully added only when they apply to signals that all have the same frequency and phase.

==Measuring instruments==

[[File:9VBatteryWithMeter.jpg|thumb|[[Multimeter]] set to measure voltage]]
Instruments for measuring voltages include the [[voltmeter]], the [[Potentiometer (measuring instrument)|potentiometer]], and the [[oscilloscope]]. The voltmeter works by measuring the current through a fixed resistor, which, according to [[Ohm's Law]], is proportional to the voltage across the resistor. The potentiometer works by balancing the unknown voltage against a known voltage in a [[bridge circuit]]. The cathode-ray oscilloscope works by amplifying the voltage and using it to deflect an [[electron]] beam from a straight path, so that the deflection of the beam is proportional to the voltage.

==Typical voltages==
{{main|Mains electricity#Choice of voltage}}
A common voltage for [[Battery (electricity)|flashlight batteries]] is 1.5&amp;nbsp;volts (DC). 
A common voltage for [[Automotive battery|automobile batteries]] is 12&amp;nbsp;volts (DC).

Common voltages supplied by power companies to consumers are 110 to 120 volts (AC) and 220 to 240&amp;nbsp;volts (AC). The voltage in [[electric power transmission]] lines used to distribute electricity from power stations can be several hundred times greater than consumer voltages, typically 110 to 1200&amp;nbsp;kV (AC).

The voltage used in [[overhead line]]s to power railway locomotives is between 12&amp;nbsp;kV and 50&amp;nbsp;kV (AC).

==Galvani potential vs. electrochemical potential==
{{main|Galvani potential|Electrochemical potential|Fermi level}}
Inside a conductive material, the energy of an electron is affected not only by the average electric potential, but also by the specific thermal and atomic environment that it is in.
When a [[voltmeter]] is connected between two different types of metal, it measures not the electrostatic potential difference, but instead something else that is affected by thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09QI-assq1cC&amp;pg=PA22 |title=Fundamentals of electrochemistry|first= Vladimir Sergeevich|last= Bagotskii|page=22|isbn=978-0-471-70058-6|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The quantity measured by a voltmeter is the negative of difference of [[electrochemical potential]] of electrons ([[Fermi level]]) divided by electron charge, while the pure unadjusted [[electrostatic potential]] (not measurable with voltmeter) is sometimes called [[Galvani potential]].
The terms &quot;voltage&quot; and &quot;electric potential&quot; are ambiguous in that, in practice, they can refer to ''either'' of these in different contexts.

The '''density''', or more precisely, the '''volumetric mass density''', of a substance is its [[mass]] per unit [[volume]]. The symbol most often used for density is '''''ρ''''' (the lower case Greek letter [[Rho (letter)|rho]]), although the Latin letter ''D'' can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/fluden.html | title =Gas Density Glenn research Center | author =''[[National Aeronautic and Space Administration|The National Aeronautic and Atmospheric Administration's]]'' ''[[Glenn Research Center]]'' | publisher =grc.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{m}{V},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the density, ''m'' is the mass, and ''V'' is the volume. In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its [[weight]] per unit [[volume]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oilgasglossary.com/density.html |title=Density definition in Oil Gas Glossary |publisher=Oilgasglossary.com |accessdate=September 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100805010226/http://oilgasglossary.com:80/density.html |archivedate=August 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called [[specific weight]].

For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]].
Different materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to [[buoyancy]], purity and [[packaging]]. [[Osmium]] and [[iridium]] are the densest known elements at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] but certain chemical compounds may be denser.

To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the [[dimensionless]] quantity &quot;[[relative density]]&quot; or &quot;[[specific gravity]]&quot;, i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.

The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance (with a few exceptions) decreases its density by increasing its volume. In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in [[convection]] of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid. This causes it to rise relative to more dense unheated material.

The reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its [[specific volume]], a term sometimes used in [[thermodynamics]]. Density is an [[intensive property]] in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass.

== History ==
In a well-known but probably apocryphal tale, [[Archimedes]] was given the task of determining whether [[Hiero II of Syracuse|King Hiero]]'s [[goldsmith]] was embezzling [[gold]] during the manufacture of a golden [[wreath]] dedicated to the gods and replacing it with another, cheaper [[alloy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lpt/archimedes.htm Archimedes, A Gold Thief and Buoyancy] – by Larry &quot;Harris&quot; Taylor, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes knew that the irregularly shaped wreath could be crushed into a cube whose volume could be calculated easily and compared with the mass; but the king did not approve of this. Baffled, Archimedes is said to have taken an immersion bath and observed from the rise of the water upon entering that he could calculate the volume of the gold wreath through the [[Displacement (fluid)|displacement]] of the water. Upon this discovery, he leapt from his bath and ran naked through the streets shouting, &quot;Eureka! Eureka!&quot; (Εύρηκα! Greek &quot;I have found it&quot;). As a result, the term &quot;[[Eureka (word)|eureka]]&quot; entered common parlance and is used today to indicate a moment of enlightenment.

The story first appeared in written form in [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura|books of architecture]]'', two centuries after it supposedly took place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html Vitruvius on Architecture, Book IX], paragraphs 9–12, translated into English and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html in the original Latin].&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have doubted the accuracy of this tale, saying among other things that the method would have required precise measurements that would have been difficult to make at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.305.5688.1219e|title=EXHIBIT: The First Eureka Moment|year=2004|journal=Science|volume=305|issue=5688|pages=1219e }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=5F1935E9-E7F2-99DF-3F1D1235AF1D2CD1 Fact or Fiction?: Archimedes Coined the Term &quot;Eureka!&quot; in the Bath], ''Scientific American'', December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the equation for density (''ρ'' = ''m'' / ''V''), mass density has units of mass divided by volume. As there are many units of mass and volume covering many different magnitudes there are a large number of units for mass density in use. The [[SI]] unit of [[kilogram]] per [[cubic metre]] (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and the [[cgs]] unit of [[gram]] per [[cubic centimetre]] (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) are probably the most commonly used units for density.{{nowrap|1,000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} equals 1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  (The cubic centimeter can be alternately called a ''millilitre'' or a ''cc''.) In industry, other larger or smaller units of mass and or volume are often more practical and [[US customary units]] may be used. See below for a list of some of the most common units of density.

== Measurement of density ==

===Homogeneous materials===
The density at all points of a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] object equals its total [[mass]] divided by its total volume. The mass is normally measured with a [[weighing scale|scale or balance]]; the volume may be measured directly (from the geometry of the object) or by the displacement of a fluid. To determine the density of a liquid or a gas, a [[hydrometer]], a [[dasymeter]] or a [[Coriolis flow meter]] may be used, respectively. Similarly, [[hydrostatic weighing]] uses the displacement of water due to a submerged object to determine the density of the object.

===Heterogeneous materials===
If the body is not homogeneous, then its density varies between different regions of the object. In that case the density around any given location is determined by calculating the density of a small volume around that location. In the limit of an infinitesimal volume the density of an inhomogeneous object at a point becomes: {{math|ρ(&lt;math&gt;\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;) {{=}} dm/dV}}, where {{math|dV}} is an elementary volume at position {{math|r}}. The mass of the body then can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;
 m = \int_V \rho(\vec{r})\,dV.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Non-compact materials ===
In practice, bulk materials such as sugar, sand, or snow contain voids. Many materials exist in nature as flakes, pellets, or granules.

Voids are regions which contain something other than the considered material.  Commonly the void is air, but it could also be vacuum,  liquid, solid, or a different gas or gaseous mixture.

The bulk volume of a material&amp;mdash;inclusive of the void fraction&amp;mdash;is often obtained by a simple measurement (e.g. with a calibrated measuring cup) or geometrically from known dimensions.

Mass divided by ''bulk'' volume determines [[bulk density]].  This is not the same thing as volumetric mass density.

To determine volumetric mass density, one must first discount the volume of the void fraction. Sometimes this can be determined by geometrical reasoning.  For the [[close-packing of equal spheres]] the non-void fraction can be at most about 74%.  It can also be determined empirically.  Some bulk materials, however, such as sand, have a ''variable'' void fraction which depends on how the material is agitated or poured. It might be loose or compact, with more or less air space depending on handling.

In practice, the void fraction is not necessarily air, or even gaseous.  In the case of sand, it could be water, which can be advantageous for measurement as the void fraction for sand saturated in water&amp;mdash;once any air bubbles are thoroughly driven out&amp;mdash;is potentially more consistent than dry sand measured with an air void.

In the case of non-compact materials, one must also take care in determining the mass of the material sample. If the material is under pressure (commonly ambient air pressure at the earth's surface) the determination of mass from a measured sample weight might need to account for buoyancy effects due to the density of the void constituent, depending on how the measurement was conducted. In the case of dry sand, sand is so much denser than air that the buoyancy effect is commonly neglected (less than one part in one thousand).

Mass change upon displacing one void material with another while maintaining constant volume can be used to estimate the void fraction, if the difference in density of the two voids materials is reliably known.

== Changes of density ==
{{Main|Compressibility|Thermal expansivity}}

In general, density can be changed by changing either the [[pressure]] or the [[temperature]]. Increasing the pressure always increases the density of a material. Increasing the temperature generally decreases the density, but there are notable exceptions to this generalization. For example, the density of [[water]] increases between its melting point at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 4&amp;nbsp;°C; similar behavior is observed in [[silicon]] at low temperatures.

The effect of pressure and temperature on the densities of liquids and solids is small. The [[compressibility]] for a typical liquid or solid is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (1&amp;nbsp;bar = 0.1&amp;nbsp;MPa) and a typical [[thermal expansivity]] is 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This roughly translates into needing around ten thousand times atmospheric pressure to reduce the volume of a substance by one percent. (Although the pressures needed may be around a thousand times smaller for sandy soil and some clays.) A one percent expansion of volume typically requires a temperature increase on the order of thousands of degrees [[Celsius]].

In contrast, the density of gases is strongly affected by pressure. The density of an [[ideal gas]] is

:&lt;math&gt;
 \rho = \frac {MP}{RT}, \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|M}} is the [[molar mass]], {{math|P}} is the pressure, {{math|R}} is the [[Gas constant|universal gas constant]], and {{math|T}} is the [[absolute temperature]]. This means that the density of an ideal gas can be doubled by doubling the pressure, or by halving the absolute temperature.

In the case of volumic thermal expansion at constant pressure and small intervals of temperature the temperature dependence of density is :
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac {{\rho_{T_0}}}{{(1 + \alpha \cdot \Delta T)}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{T_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the density at a reference temperature, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal expansion coefficient of the material at temperatures close to &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Density of solutions ==
The density of a [[solution]] is the sum of [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass (massic) concentrations]] of the components of that solution.

Mass (massic) concentration of each given component ρ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in a solution sums to density of the solution.
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \sum_i \varrho_i \,&lt;/math&gt;

Expressed as a function of the densities of pure components of the mixture and their [[volume concentration|volume participation]], it allows the determination of [[excess molar quantity|excess molar volumes]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \sum_i  \rho_i \frac{V_i}{V}\,= \sum_i  \rho_i \varphi_i =\sum_i  \rho_i \frac{V_i}{\sum_i V_i + \sum_i V_i^{E}}&lt;/math&gt;
provided that there is no interaction between the components.

Knowing the relation between excess volumes and activity coefficients of the  components, one can determine the activity coefficients.
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{V^E}_i= RT \frac{\partial (ln(\gamma_i))}{\partial P}&lt;/math&gt;

== Common units ==
The [[SI]] unit for density is:
* [[kilogram]]s per [[cubic meter]] (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

Litres and metric tons are not part of the SI, but are acceptable for use with it, leading to the following units:
* [[kilogram]]s per [[liter]] (kg/L)
* [[gram]]s per [[milliliter]] (g/mL)
* [[metric ton]]s per cubic meter (t/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

Densities using the following metric units all have exactly the same numerical value, one thousandth of the value in (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Liquid [[water]] has a density of about 1&amp;nbsp;kg/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, making any of these SI units numerically convenient to use as most [[solid]]s and [[liquid]]s have densities between 0.1 and 20&amp;nbsp;kg/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* kilograms per cubic decimetre (kg/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* grams per cubic centimetre (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
** 1 gram/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* megagrams (metric tons) per cubic metre (Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

In [[US customary units]] density can be stated in:
* [[Avoirdupois ounce]]s per [[cubic inch]] (oz/cu&amp;nbsp;in)
* [[Pound (mass)|Avoirdupois pounds]] per cubic inch (lb/cu&amp;nbsp;in)
* pounds per [[cubic foot]] (lb/cu&amp;nbsp;ft)
* pounds per [[cubic yard]] (lb/cu&amp;nbsp;yd)
* pounds per [[US liquid gallon]] (lb/gal)
* pounds per US [[bushel]] (lb/bu)
* [[slug (mass)|slugs]] per cubic foot

[[Imperial units]] differing from the above (as the Imperial gallon and bushel differ from the US units) in practice are rarely used, though found in older documents. The density of [[precious metal]]s could conceivably be based on [[Troy weight|Troy]] ounces and pounds, a possible cause of confusion.

A '''characteristic property''' is a [[Chemical property|chemical]] or [[physical property]] that helps identify and classify substances. The characteristic properties of a substance are always the same whether the [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] one is observing is large or small. Examples of characteristic properties include freezing/melting point, boiling/condensing point, [[density]], [[magnetism]], and [[solubility]].&lt;ref name=&quot;def1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuesd.tehama.k12.ca.us/maywood/staff/farmer/characteristic_properties.htm|title=Characteristic Properties|publisher=www.cuesd.tehama.k12.ca.us|accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying a substance==

Every characteristic property is unique to one given substance. Scientists use characteristic properties to identify an unknown substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Characteristic Properties|url=http://www.emsb.qc.ca/laurenhill/science/characteristic.html|publisher=EMSB|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristic properties are used because the sample size and the shape of the substance does not matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Density as a Characteristic Property|url=http://www.propertiesofmatter.si.edu/Density_Characteristic_Property.html|work=Properties of Matter|publisher=NSRC|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1 gram of lead is still the same color as 100 tons of lead.

'''Electric field intensity''' is defined as the strength of an [[electric field]] at any point in the space. It is equal to the Electric force per unit charge experienced by a test charge placed at that point. The unit of measurement is the [[volt]]/[[meter]] or [[Newton]]/[[Coulomb]].
This physical quantity has dimensions as MLT(-3)A(-1). 

Electric Field Intensity Is defined as :-&quot;The electric field intensity due to point charge at any point in the electric field is defined as the electrostatic force exerted by it on a unit positive charge placed at that point.&quot;

'''Electric charge''' is the [[physical property]] of [[matter]] that causes it to experience a [[force]] when placed in an electromagnetic field. There are two types of electric charges: [[proton|positive]] and [[electron|negative]]. Positively charged substances are repelled from other positively charged substances, but attracted to negatively charged substances; negatively charged substances are repelled from negative and attracted to positive. An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of [[electron]]s, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The [[Systeme International|SI]] derived unit of electric charge is the [[coulomb]] (C), although in electrical engineering it is also common to use the [[ampere-hour]] (Ah), and in [[chemistry]] it is common to use the [[elementary charge]] (''e'') as a unit. The symbol ''Q'' is often used to denote charge. The early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called [[classical electrodynamics]], and is still very accurate if [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]] do not need to be considered.

The ''electric charge'' is a fundamental  [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved property]] of some [[subatomic particle]]s, which determines their [[electromagnetic interaction]]. Electrically charged matter is influenced by, and produces, [[electromagnetic field]]s. The interaction between a moving charge and an electromagnetic field is the source of the [[electromagnetic force]], which is one of the four [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] (See also: [[magnetic field]]).

Twentieth-century [[Oil-drop experiment|experiments]] demonstrated that electric charge is ''[[charge quantization|quantized]]''; that is, it comes in integer multiples of individual small units called the [[elementary charge]], ''e'', approximately equal to {{val|1.602|e=-19|u=coulombs}} (except for particles called [[quark]]s, which have charges that are integer multiples of ''e/3''). The [[proton]] has a charge of +''e'', and the [[electron]] has a charge of −''e''. The study of charged particles, and how their interactions are mediated by [[photons]], is called [[quantum electrodynamics]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Electric field point lines equipotentials.svg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram showing field lines and [[equipotential]]s around an [[electron]], a negatively charged particle. In an electrically neutral [[atom]], the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons (which are positively charged), resulting in a net zero overall charge]]

Charge is the fundamental property of forms of matter that exhibit [[electrostatic]] attraction or repulsion in the presence of other matter.
Electric charge is a characteristic property of many [[charged particle|subatomic particles]]. The charges of free-standing particles are integer multiples of the [[elementary charge]] ''e''; we say that electric charge is ''quantized''. [[Michael Faraday]], in his [[electrolysis]] experiments, was the first to note the discrete nature of electric charge. [[Robert Millikan]]'s [[oil-drop experiment]] demonstrated this fact directly, and measured the elementary charge.

By convention, the charge of an [[electron]] is −1, while that of a [[proton]] is +1. Charged particles whose charges have the same sign repel one another, and particles whose charges have different signs attract. [[Coulomb's law]] quantifies the electrostatic [[force]] between two particles by asserting that the force is proportional to the product of their charges, and [[inverse square|inversely proportional to the square]] of the distance between them.

The charge of an [[antiparticle]] equals that of the corresponding particle, but with opposite sign. [[Quark]]s have fractional charges of either −{{sfrac|1|3}} or +{{sfrac|2|3}}, but free-standing quarks have never been observed (the theoretical reason for this fact is [[asymptotic freedom]]).

The electric charge of a [[macroscopic]] object is the sum of the electric charges of the particles that make it up. This charge is often small, because matter is made of [[atom]]s, and atoms typically have equal numbers of [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s, in which case their charges cancel out, yielding a net charge of zero, thus making the atom neutral.

An ''[[ion]]'' is an atom (or group of atoms) that has lost one or more electrons, giving it a net positive charge (cation), or that has gained one or more electrons, giving it a net negative charge (anion). ''Monatomic ions'' are formed from single atoms, while ''polyatomic ions'' are formed from two or more atoms that have been bonded together, in each case yielding an ion with a positive or negative net charge.

During formation of macroscopic objects, constituent atoms and ions usually combine to form structures composed of neutral ''ionic compounds'' electrically bound to neutral atoms. Thus macroscopic objects tend toward being neutral overall, but macroscopic objects are rarely perfectly net neutral.

Sometimes macroscopic objects contain ions distributed throughout the material, rigidly bound in place, giving an overall net positive or negative charge to the object. Also, macroscopic objects made of conductive elements, can more or less easily (depending on the element) take on or give off electrons, and then maintain a net negative or positive charge indefinitely. When the net electric charge of an object is non-zero and motionless, the phenomenon is known as [[static electricity]]. This can easily be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together, such as rubbing [[amber]] with [[fur]] or [[glass]] with [[silk]]. In this way non-conductive materials can be charged to a significant degree, either positively or negatively. Charge taken from one material is moved to the other material, leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind. The law of ''[[conservation of charge]]'' always applies, giving the object from which a negative charge has been taken a positive charge of the same magnitude, and vice versa.

Even when an object's net charge is zero, charge can be distributed non-uniformly in the object (e.g., due to an external [[electromagnetic field]], or bound polar molecules). In such cases the object is said to be [[Polarization density|polarized]].  The charge due to polarization is known as [[bound charge]], while charge on an object produced by electrons gained or lost from outside the object is called ''free charge''. The motion of electrons in conductive [[metal]]s in a specific direction is known as [[electric current]].

== Units ==
The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of [[quantity of electricity|quantity of electric charge]] is the [[coulomb]], which is equivalent to about {{val|6.242|e=18|u=''[[elementary charge|e]]''}} (''e'' is the charge of a proton).  Hence, the charge of an electron is approximately {{val|-1.602|e=-19|u=C}}.  The coulomb is defined as the quantity of charge that has passed through the [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of an [[electrical conductor]] carrying one [[ampere]] within one [[second]].  The symbol ''Q'' is often used to denote a quantity of electricity or charge.  The quantity of electric charge can be directly measured with an [[electrometer]], or indirectly measured with a [[galvanometer|ballistic galvanometer]].

After finding the [[charge quantization|quantized]] character of charge, in 1891 [[George Johnstone Stoney|George Stoney]] proposed the unit 'electron' for this fundamental unit of electrical charge. This was before the discovery of the particle by [[J. J. Thomson|J.J. Thomson]] in 1897. The unit is today treated as nameless, referred to as &quot;elementary charge&quot;, &quot;fundamental unit of charge&quot;, or simply as &quot;e&quot;. A measure of charge should be a multiple of the elementary charge ''e'', even if at [[macroscopic scale|large scales]] charge seems to behave as a [[real number|real quantity]]. In some contexts it is meaningful to speak of fractions of a charge; for example in the charging of a [[capacitor]], or in the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].

In systems of units other than SI such as [[cgs]], electric charge is expressed as combination of only three fundamental quantities such as length, mass and time and not four as in SI where electric charge is a combination of length, mass, time and electric current.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== History ==
[[File:Bcoulomb.png|thumb|Coulomb's [[Torsion balance#Torsion balance|torsion balance]]]]
As reported by the ancient Greek mathematician [[Thales of Miletus]] around 600 BC, charge (or ''electricity'') could be accumulated by rubbing [[fur]] on various substances, such as [[amber]]. The Greeks noted that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such as [[hair]].  They also noted that if they rubbed the amber for long enough, they could even get an [[electric spark]] to jump.  This property derives from the [[triboelectric effect]].

In 1600, the English scientist [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] returned to the subject in ''De Magnete'', and coined the [[New Latin]] word ''electricus'' from {{lang|grc|ἤλεκτρον}} (ēlektron), the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word for ''amber'', which soon gave rise to the English words &quot;electric&quot; and &quot;electricity.&quot; He was followed in 1660 by [[Otto von Guericke]], who invented what was probably the first [[electrostatic generator]].  Other European pioneers were [[Robert Boyle]], who in 1675 stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a [[vacuum]]; [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]], who in 1729 classified materials as [[electrical conductor|conductors]] and [[electrical insulation|insulators]]; and [[C. F. du Fay]], who proposed in 1733&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparkmuseum.com/BOOK_DUFAY.HTM Two Kinds of Electrical Fluid: Vitreous and Resinous – 1733]&lt;/ref&gt; that electricity comes in two varieties that cancel each other, and expressed this in terms of a two-fluid theory.  When [[glass]] was rubbed with [[silk]], du Fay said that the glass was charged with ''[[Glass|vitreous]] electricity'', and, when amber was rubbed with fur, the amber was said to be charged with ''resinous electricity''. In 1839, [[Michael Faraday]] showed that the apparent division between [[static electricity]], [[electric current|current electricity]], and [[bioelectricity]] was incorrect, and all were a consequence of the behavior of a single kind of [[electricity]] appearing in opposite [[electrical polarity|polarities]]. It is arbitrary which polarity is called positive and which is called negative. Positive charge can be defined as the charge left on a glass rod after being rubbed with silk.&lt;ref&gt;Electromagnetic Fields (2nd Edition), Roald K. Wangsness, Wiley, 1986. ISBN 0-471-81186-6 (intermediate level textbook)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the foremost experts on electricity in the 18th century was [[Benjamin Franklin]], who argued in favour of a one-[[fluid theory of electricity]].  Franklin imagined electricity as being a type of invisible fluid present in all matter; for example, he believed that it was the [[glass]] in a [[Leyden jar]] that held the accumulated charge. He posited that rubbing insulating surfaces together caused this fluid to change location, and that a flow of this fluid constitutes an electric current.  He also posited that when matter contained too little of the fluid it was &quot;negatively&quot; charged, and when it had an excess it was &quot;positively&quot; charged.  For a reason that was not recorded, he identified the term &quot;positive&quot; with vitreous electricity and &quot;negative&quot; with resinous electricity.  [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] arrived at the same explanation at about the same time.

== Static electricity and electric current ==
[[Static electricity]] and [[electric current]] are two separate phenomena. They both involve electric charge, and may occur simultaneously in the same object.  Static electricity refers to the electric charge of an object and the related [[electrostatic discharge]] when two objects are brought together that are not at equilibrium.  An electrostatic discharge creates a change in the charge of each of the two objects.  In contrast, electric current is the flow of electric charge through an object, which produces no net loss or gain of electric charge.

=== Electrification by friction ===
{{further|triboelectric effect}}
{{close paraphrasing|section|source=https://archive.org/details/ATreatiseOnElectricityMagnetism-Volume1|free=yes|date=November 2014}}
When a piece of glass and a piece of resin—neither of which exhibit any electrical properties—are rubbed together and left with the rubbed surfaces in contact, they still exhibit no electrical properties. When separated, they attract each other.

A second piece of glass rubbed with a second piece of resin, then separated and suspended near the former pieces of glass and resin causes these phenomena:

* The two pieces of glass repel each other.
* Each piece of glass attracts each piece of resin.
* The two pieces of resin repel each other.

This attraction and repulsion is an ''electrical phenomena,'' and the bodies that exhibit them are said to be ''electrified'', or ''electrically charged''. Bodies may be electrified in many other ways, as well as by friction. The electrical properties of the two pieces of glass are similar to each other but opposite to those of the two pieces of resin: The glass attracts what the resin repels and repels what the resin attracts.

If a body electrified in any manner whatsoever behaves as the glass does, that is, if it repels the glass and attracts the resin, the body is said to be 'vitreously' electrified, and if it attracts the glass and repels the resin it is said to be 'resinously' electrified. All electrified bodies are found to be either vitreously or resinously electrified.

It is the established convention of the scientific community to define the vitreous electrification as positive, and the resinous electrification as negative. The exactly opposite properties of the two kinds of electrification justify our indicating them by opposite signs, but the application of the positive sign to one rather than to the other kind must be considered as a matter of arbitrary convention, just as it is a matter of convention in [[mathematical diagram]] to reckon positive distances towards the right hand.

No force, either of attraction or of repulsion, can be observed between an electrified body and a body not electrified.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell]] ''A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'', pp. 32-33, Dover Publications Inc., 1954 ASIN: B000HFDK0K, 3rd ed. of 1891&lt;/ref&gt;

Actually, all bodies are electrified, but may appear not to be so by the relative similar charge of neighboring objects in the environment. An object further electrified + or – creates an equivalent or opposite charge by default in neighboring objects, until those charges can equalize. The effects of attraction can be observed in high-voltage experiments, while lower voltage effects are merely weaker and therefore less obvious. The attraction and repulsion forces are codified by [[Coulomb's Law]] (attraction falls off at the square of the distance, which has a corollary for acceleration in a gravitational field, suggesting that gravitation may be merely electrostatic phenomenon between relatively weak charges in terms of scale). See also the [[Casimir effect]].

It is now known that the Franklin/Watson model was fundamentally correct.  There is only one kind of electrical charge, and only one variable is required to keep track of the amount of charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;one-kind&quot;&gt;[http://www.av8n.com/physics/one-kind-of-charge.htm One Kind of Charge]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, just knowing the charge is not a complete description of the situation.  Matter is composed of several kinds of electrically charged particles, and these particles have many properties, not just charge.

The most common charge carriers are the positively charged [[proton]] and the negatively charged [[electron]].  The movement of any of these charged particles constitutes an electric current.  In many situations, it suffices to speak of the ''[[conventional current]]'' without regard to whether it is carried by positive charges moving in the direction of the conventional current or by negative charges moving in the opposite direction.  This macroscopic viewpoint is an approximation that simplifies electromagnetic concepts and calculations.

At the opposite extreme, if one looks at the microscopic situation, one sees there are many ways of carrying an [[electric current]], including: a flow of electrons; a flow of electron &quot;[[Electron hole|holes]]&quot; that act like positive particles; and both negative and positive particles ([[ion]]s or other charged particles) flowing in opposite directions in an [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] [[solution]] or a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].

Beware that, in the common and important case of metallic wires, the direction of the conventional current is opposite to the [[drift velocity]] of the actual charge carriers, i.e., the electrons.  This is a source of confusion for beginners.

== Properties ==
{{Flavour quantum numbers}}

Aside from the properties described in articles about [[electromagnetism]], charge is a [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[Charge invariance|invariant]].  This means that any particle that has charge ''Q'', no matter how fast it goes, always has charge ''Q''.  This property has been experimentally verified by showing that the charge of ''one'' [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s bound together in a nucleus and moving around at high speeds) is the same as ''two'' [[deuterium]] nuclei (one proton and one neutron bound together, but moving much more slowly than they would if they were in a helium nucleus).{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

== Conservation of electric charge ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Conservation law (physics)|Conservation law]] --&gt;
{{Main|Charge conservation}}
The total electric charge of an [[isolated system]] remains constant regardless of changes within the system itself. This law is inherent to all processes known to physics and can be derived in a local form from [[gauge invariance]] of the [[wave function]]. The conservation of charge results in the charge-current [[continuity equation]]. More generally, the net change in [[charge density]] ''ρ'' within a volume of integration ''V'' is equal to the area integral over the [[current density]] '''J''' through the closed surface ''S'' = ∂''V'', which is in turn equal to the net [[Electric current|current]] ''I'':

:{{oiint|preintegral=&lt;math&gt;- \frac{d}{dt} \int_V \rho \, \mathrm{d}V = &lt;/math&gt;|intsubscpt=&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \partial V&lt;/math&gt;|integrand=&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J \cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf S = \int J \mathrm{d}S \cos\theta = I.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Thus, the conservation of electric charge, as expressed by the continuity equation, gives the result:

:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The charge transferred between times &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{f}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by integrating both sides:

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \int_{t_{\mathrm{i}}}^{t_{\mathrm{f}}} I\, \mathrm{d}t &lt;/math&gt;

where ''I'' is the net outward current through a closed surface and ''Q'' is the electric charge contained within the volume defined by the surface.

In [[optics]] the '''refractive index''' or '''index of refraction''' ''n'' of an [[optical medium|material]] is a [[dimensionless number]] that describes how [[EM radiation|light]], propagates through that medium. It is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{c}{v},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]] and ''v'' is the speed of light in the medium. For example, the refractive index of water is 1.33, meaning that light travels 1.33 times faster in a vacuum than it does in water

[[File:Refraction at interface.svg|thumb|170px|Refraction of a light ray.|alt=Illustration of the incidence and refraction angles]]

The refractive index determines how much light is bent, or [[refraction|refracted]], when entering a material. This is the first documented use of refractive indices and is described by [[Snell's law]] of refraction,
''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;sin''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;sin''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,
where ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[angles of incidence]] and refraction, respectively, of a ray crossing the interface between two media with refractive indices ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The refractive indices also determine the amount of light that is [[reflectivity|reflected]] when reaching the interface, as well as the critical angle for [[total internal reflection]] and [[Brewster's angle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hecht&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | author = Hecht, Eugene  | title = Optics | publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-321-18878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refractive index can be seen as the factor by which the speed and the [[wavelength]] of the radiation are reduced with respect to their vacuum values: the speed of light in a medium is ''v'' = ''c''/''n'', and similarly the wavelength in that medium is ''λ'' = ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'', where ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the wavelength of that light in vacuum. This implies that vacuum has a refractive index of 1, and that the [[frequency]] (''f'' = ''v''/''λ'') of the wave is not affected by the refractive index.

The refractive index varies with the wavelength of light. This is called [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] and causes the splitting of white light into its constituent colors in [[Prism (optics)|prisms]] and [[rainbow]]s, and [[chromatic aberration]] in lenses. Light propagation in [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbing]] materials can be described using a [[complex number|complex]]-valued refractive index.&lt;ref name=&quot;Attwood&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Soft X-rays and extreme ultraviolet radiation: principles and applications|author=Attwood, David |page=60|isbn=0-521-02997-X|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] part then handles the [[attenuation]], while the [[Real number|real]] part accounts for refraction.

The concept of refractive index is widely used within the full [[electromagnetic spectrum]], from [[X-ray]]s to [[radio wave]]s. It can also be used with [[wave]] phenomena such as [[sound]]. In this case the speed of sound is used instead of that of light and a reference medium other than vacuum must be chosen.&lt;ref name=Kinsler&gt;{{cite book | author = Kinsler, Lawrence E. | title = Fundamentals of Acoustics | publisher = John  Wiley | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-471-84789-5 | page = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The refractive index ''n'' of an optical medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum, ''c'' = {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}, and the [[phase velocity]] ''v'' of light in the medium,&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n=\frac{c}{v}.&lt;/math&gt;
The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests or the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the [[wave]] moves, which may be different from the [[group velocity]], the speed at which the pulse of light or the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the wave moves.

The definition above is sometimes referred to as the '''absolute refractive index''' or the '''absolute index of refraction''' to distinguish it from definitions where the speed of light in other reference media than vacuum is used.&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt; Historically [[air]] at a standardized [[pressure]] and [[temperature]] have been common as a reference medium.

==History==
[[File:Thomas Young (scientist).jpg|thumb|120px|alt=Stipple engraving of Thomas Young|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] coined the term ''index of refraction''.]]

[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] was presumably the person who first used, and invented, the name &quot;index of refraction&quot;, in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Thomas|title=A course of lectures on natural philosophy and the mechanical arts|year=1807|page=413|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YPRZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA413}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the same time he changed this value of refractive power into a single number, instead of the traditional ratio of two numbers. The ratio had the disadvantage of different appearances. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], who called it the &quot;proportion of the sines of incidence and refraction&quot;, wrote it as a ratio of two numbers, like &quot;529 to 396&quot; (or &quot;nearly 4 to 3&quot;; for water).&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Opticks: Or, A Treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and Colours of Light|year=1730|page=247|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GnAFAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Francis Hauksbee|Hauksbee]], who called it the &quot;ratio of refraction&quot;, wrote it as a ratio with a fixed numerator, like &quot;10000 to 7451.9&quot; (for urine).&lt;ref name=Hauksbee&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rstl.1710.0015|last=Hauksbee|first=Francis|title=A Description of the Apparatus for Making Experiments on the Refractions of Fluids|year=1710|page=207|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=27|issue=325–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles Hutton|Hutton]] wrote it as a ratio with a fixed denominator, like 1.3358 to 1 (water).&lt;ref name=Hutton&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Charles|title=Philosophical and mathematical dictionary|year=1795|page=299|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lsdJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young did not use a symbol for the index of refraction, in 1807. In the next years, others started using different symbols: 
n, m, and µ.&lt;ref name=Fraunhofer&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Joseph von Fraunhofer|von Fraunhofer]]|first=Joseph|title=Bestimmung des Brechungs und Farbenzerstreuungs Vermogens verschiedener Glasarten|journal=Denkschriften der Königlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu München|year=1817|volume=5|page=208|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lMRSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA208}} Exponent des Brechungsverhältnisses is index of refraction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brewster&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[David Brewster|Brewster]]|first=David|title=On the structure of doubly refracting crystals|journal=Philosophical Magazine|year=1815|volume=45|page=126|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GhpRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124|doi=10.1080/14786441508638398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Herschel&gt;{{cite book|last=[[John Herschel|Herschel]]|first=John F.W.|title=On the Theory of Light|year=1828|page=368|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Lo4_AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol n gradually prevailed.

For [[visible light]] most [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] media have refractive indices between 1 and 2. A few examples are given in the adjacent table. These values are measured at the yellow doublet [[sodium]] [[D-line]], with a wavelength of 589 [[nanometers]], as is conventionally done.&lt;ref name=FBI/&gt; Gases at atmospheric pressure have refractive indices close to 1 because of their low density. Almost all solids and liquids have refractive indices above 1.3, with [[aerogel]] as the clear exception. Aerogel is a very low density solid that can be produced with refractive index in the range from 1.002 to 1.265.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author=Tabata, M.| title=Development of Silica Aerogel with Any Density
 | journal=2005 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record | year=2005 | url=http://www.ppl.phys.chiba-u.jp/~makoto/publication/N14-191.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond lies at the other end of the range with a refractive index as high as 2.42. Most plastics have refractive indices in the range from 1.3 to 1.7, but some [[high-refractive-index polymer]]s can have values as high as 1.76.&lt;ref&gt;Naoki Sadayori and Yuji Hotta &quot;Polycarbodiimide having high index of refraction and production method thereof&quot; [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=va2WAAAAEBAJ US patent 2004/0158021 A1] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[infrared]] light refractive indices can be considerably higher. [[Germanium]] is transparent in the wavelength region from 2 to 14&amp;nbsp;µm and has a refractive index of about 4, making it an important material for infrared optics.&lt;ref&gt;Tosi, Jeffrey L., article on [http://www.photonics.com/EDU/Handbook.aspx?AID=25495 Common Infrared Optical Materials] in the Photonics Handbook, accessed on 2014-09-10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refractive index below unity===
According to the [[theory of relativity]], no information can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum, but this does not mean that the refractive index cannot be lower than 1. The refractive index measures the [[phase velocity]] of light, which does not carry [[information]].&lt;ref name=Als-Nielsen2011&gt;{{cite book|last=Als-Nielsen|first=J.; McMorrow, D.|title=Elements of Modern X-ray Physics|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-0-470-97395-0|page=25|quote=One consequence of the real part of ''n'' being less than unity is that it implies that the phase velocity inside the material, ''c''/''n'', is larger than the velocity of light, ''c''. This does not, however, violate the law of relativity, which requires that only signals carrying information do not travel faster than ''c''. Such signals move with the group velocity, not with the phase velocity, and it can be shown that the group velocity is in fact less than ''c''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests of the wave move and can be faster than the speed of light in vacuum, and thereby give a refractive index below 1. This can occur close to [[resonance frequency|resonance frequencies]], for absorbing media, in [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, and for [[X-ray]]s. In the X-ray regime the refractive indices are lower than but very close to 1 (exceptions close to some resonance frequencies).&lt;ref name=CXRO&gt;{{cite web |url = http://henke.lbl.gov/optical_constants/ |title = X-Ray Interactions With Matter |publisher = The Center for X-Ray Optics |accessdate = 2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As an example, water has a refractive index of {{val|0.99999974}} = 1 − {{val|2.6|e=-7}} for X-ray radiation at a photon energy of {{val|30|ul=keV}} (0.04&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength).&lt;ref name=CXRO/&gt;

===Negative refractive index===

Recent research has also demonstrated the existence of materials with a negative refractive index, which can occur if [[permittivity]] and [[magnetic permeability|permeability]] have simultaneous negative values.&lt;ref name=veselago1968&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veselago|first=V.

The resulting [[negative refraction]] (i.e., a reversal of [[Snell's law]]) offers the possibility of the [[superlens]] and other exotic phenomena.&lt;ref name = shalaev2007&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shalaev | first = V.

==Microscopic explanation==
At the microscale, an electromagnetic wave's phase velocity is slowed in a material because the [[electric field]] creates a disturbance in the charges of each atom (primarily the [[electron]]s) proportional to the [[electric susceptibility]] of the medium. (Similarly, the [[magnetic field]] creates a disturbance proportional to the [[magnetic susceptibility]].) As the electromagnetic fields oscillate in the wave, the charges in the material will be &quot;shaken&quot; back and forth at the same frequency.&lt;ref name = Hecht /&gt;{{rp|67}} The charges thus radiate their own electromagnetic wave that is at the same frequency, but usually with a [[phase (waves)|phase delay]], as the charges may move out of phase with the force driving them (see [[Harmonic oscillator#Sinusoidal driving force|sinusoidally driven harmonic oscillator]]). The light wave traveling in the medium is the macroscopic [[superposition principle|superposition (sum)]] of all such contributions in the material: the original wave plus the waves radiated by all the moving charges. This wave is typically a wave with the same frequency but shorter wavelength than the original, leading to a slowing of the wave's phase velocity. Most of the radiation from oscillating material charges will modify the incoming wave, changing its velocity. However, some net energy will be radiated in other directions or even at other frequencies (see [[scattering]]).

Depending on the relative phase of the original driving wave and the waves radiated by the charge motion, there are several possibilities:
*If the electrons emit a light wave which is 90° out of phase with the light wave shaking them, it will cause the total light wave to travel more slowly. This is the normal refraction of transparent materials like glass or water, and corresponds to a refractive index which is real and greater than 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feynman, Richard P. 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Feynman, Richard P. | title = Feynman Lectures on Physics 1: Mainly Mechanics, Radiation, and Heat | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2011 | page =  | isbn = 978-0-465-02493-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the electrons emit a light wave which is 270° out of phase with the light wave shaking them, it will cause the total light wave to travel more quickly. This is called &quot;anomalous refraction&quot;, and is observed close to absorption lines, with [[X-ray]]s, and in some microwave systems. It corresponds to a refractive index less than 1. (Even though the [[phase velocity]] of light is greater than the [[speed of light|speed of light in vacuum]] ''c'', the [[signal velocity]] is not, as discussed above). If the response is sufficiently strong and out-of-phase, the result is a [[negative refractive index]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Feynman, Richard P. 2011&quot;/&gt;
*If the electrons emit a light wave which is 180° out of phase with the light wave shaking them, it will destructively interfere with the original light to reduce the total light intensity. This is [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|light absorption in opaque materials]] and corresponds to an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] refractive index.
*If the electrons emit a light wave which is in phase with the light wave shaking them, it will amplify the light wave. This is rare, but occurs in [[laser]]s due to [[stimulated emission]]. It corresponds to an imaginary index of refraction, with the opposite sign to that of absorption.
For most materials at visible-light frequencies, the phase is somewhere between 90° and 180°, corresponding to a combination of both refraction and absorption.

==Dispersion==

{{Main|Dispersion (optics)}}

The refractive index of materials varies with the wavelength (and [[frequency]]) of light.&lt;ref name=dispersion_ELPT&gt;R. Paschotta, article on [https://www.rp-photonics.com/chromatic_dispersion.html chromatic dispersion] in the [https://www.rp-photonics.com/encyclopedia.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology], accessed on 2014-09-08&lt;/ref&gt; This is called dispersion and causes [[prism (optics)|prism]]s and [[rainbow]]s to divide white light into its constituent spectral [[color]]s.&lt;ref name=hyperphysics_dispersion&gt;Carl R. Nave, page on [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/dispersion.html Dispersion] in [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html HyperPhysics], Department of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State University, accessed on 2014-09-08&lt;/ref&gt; As the refractive index varies with wavelength, so will the refraction angle as light goes from one material to another. Dispersion also causes the [[focal length]] of [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] to be wavelength dependent. This is a type of [[chromatic aberration]], which often needs to be corrected for in imaging systems. In regions of the spectrum where the material does not absorb light, the refractive index tends to decrease with increasing wavelength, and thus increase with frequency. This is called &quot;normal dispersion&quot;, in contrast to &quot;anomalous dispersion&quot;, where the refractive index increases with wavelength.&lt;ref name=dispersion_ELPT/&gt; For visible light normal dispersion means that the refractive index is higher for blue light than for red.

For optics in the visual range, the amount of dispersion of a lens material is often quantified by the [[Abbe number]]:&lt;ref name=hyperphysics_dispersion/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{n_\mathrm{yellow} - 1}{n_\mathrm{blue} - n_\mathrm{red}}.&lt;/math&gt;
For a more accurate description of the wavelength dependence of the refractive index, the [[Sellmeier equation]] can be used.&lt;ref&gt;R. Paschotta, article on [https://www.rp-photonics.com/sellmeier_formula.html Sellmeier formula] in the [https://www.rp-photonics.com/encyclopedia.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology], accessed on 2014-09-08&lt;/ref&gt; It is an empirical formula that works well in describing dispersion. ''Sellmeier coefficients'' are often quoted instead of the refractive index in tables.

Because of dispersion, it is usually important to specify the vacuum wavelength of light for which a refractive index is measured. Typically, measurements are done at various well-defined spectral [[emission line]]s; for example, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; usually denotes the refractive index at the [[Fraunhofer lines|Fraunhofer]] &quot;D&quot; line, the centre of the yellow [[sodium]] double emission at 589.29 [[nanometre|nm]] wavelength.&lt;ref name=FBI&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/forensic-science-communications/fsc/jan2005/index.htm/standards/2005standards9.htm |title =  Forensic Science Communications, Glass Refractive Index Determination |publisher = FBI Laboratory Services |accessdate = 2014-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complex refractive index==

{{see also|Mathematical descriptions of opacity}}

When light passes through a medium, some part of it will always be [[Attenuation|attenuated]]. This can be conveniently taken into account by defining a complex refractive index,
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{n} = n + i\kappa.&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the real part ''n'' is the refractive index and indicates the [[phase velocity]], while the imaginary part ''κ'' is called the '''extinction coefficient''' — although ''κ'' can also refer to the [[mass attenuation coefficient]]—&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        =http://web.mit.edu/course/6/6.732/www/6.732-pt2.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} and indicates the amount of attenuation when the electromagnetic wave propagates through the material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hecht&quot;/&gt;{{rp|128}}

That ''κ'' corresponds to attenuation can be seen by inserting this refractive index into the expression for [[electric field]] of a [[plane wave|plane]] electromagnetic wave traveling in the ''z''-direction. We can do this by relating the complex wave number &lt;u&gt;''k''&lt;/u&gt; to the complex refractive index &lt;u&gt;''n''&lt;/u&gt; through &lt;u&gt;''k''&lt;/u&gt; = 2π&lt;u&gt;''n''&lt;/u&gt;/''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; being the vacuum wavelength; this can be inserted into the plane wave expression as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}(z, t) = \operatorname{Re}\! \left[\mathbf{E}_0 e^{i(\underline{k}z - \omega t)}\right] = \operatorname{Re}\! \left[\mathbf{E}_0 e^{i(2\pi(n + i\kappa)z/\lambda_0 - \omega t)}\right] = e^{-2\pi \kappa z/\lambda_0} \operatorname{Re}\! \left[\mathbf{E}_0 e^{i(kz - \omega t)}\right].&lt;/math&gt;
Here we see that ''κ'' gives an exponential decay, as expected from the [[Beer–Lambert law]]. Since intensity is proportional to the square of the electric field, it will depend on the depth into the material as exp(−4π''κz''/''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), and the [[attenuation coefficient]] becomes ''α'' = 4π''κ''/''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hecht&quot;/&gt;{{rp|128}} This also relates it to the [[penetration depth]], the distance after which the intensity is reduced by 1/''e'', ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''α'' = ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/(4π''κ'').

Both ''n'' and ''κ'' are dependent on the frequency. In most circumstances ''κ'' &gt; 0 (light is absorbed) or ''κ'' = 0 (light travels forever without loss). In special situations, especially in the [[gain medium]] of [[laser]]s, it is also possible that ''κ'' &lt; 0, corresponding to an amplification of the light.

An alternative convention uses &lt;u&gt;''n''&lt;/u&gt; = ''n'' − ''iκ'' instead of &lt;u&gt;''n''&lt;/u&gt; = ''n'' + ''iκ'', but where ''κ'' &gt; 0 still corresponds to loss. Therefore these two conventions are inconsistent and should not be confused. The difference is related to defining sinusoidal time dependence as Re[exp(−''iωt'')] versus Re[exp(+''iωt'')]. See [[Mathematical descriptions of opacity]].

Dielectric loss and non-zero DC conductivity in materials cause absorption. Good dielectric materials such as glass have extremely low DC conductivity, and at low frequencies the dielectric loss is also negligible, resulting in almost no absorption. However, at higher frequencies (such as visible light), dielectric loss may increase absorption significantly, reducing the material's [[transparency (optics)|transparency]] to these frequencies.

The real, ''n'', and imaginary, ''κ'', parts of the complex refractive index are related through the [[Kramers–Kronig relation]]s. In 1986 A.R. Forouhi and I. Bloomer deduced an [[Refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin film materials|equation]] describing ''κ'' as a function of photon energy, ''E'', applicable to amorphous materials. Forouhi and Bloomer then applied the Kramers–Kronig relation to derive the corresponding equation for [[Refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin film materials|''n'' as a function of ''E'']]. The same formalism was applied to crystalline materials by Forouhi and Bloomer in 1988.

The refractive index and extinction coefficient, ''n'' and ''κ'', cannot be measured directly. They must be determined indirectly from measurable quantities that depend on them, such as [[Refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin film materials|reflectance, ''R'', or transmittance, ''T'']], or ellipsometric parameters, [[ellipsometry|''ψ'' and ''δ'']]. The determination of ''n'' and ''κ'' from such measured quantities will involve developing a theoretical expression for ''R'' or ''T'', or ''ψ'' and ''δ'' in terms of a valid physical model for ''n'' and ''κ''. By fitting the theoretical model to the measured ''R'' or ''T'', or ''ψ'' and ''δ'' using regression analysis, ''n'' and ''κ'' can be deduced.

For [[X-ray]] and [[extreme ultraviolet]] radiation the complex refractive index deviates only slightly from unity and usually has a real part smaller than 1. It is therefore normally written as &lt;u&gt;''n''&lt;/u&gt; = 1 − ''δ'' + ''iβ'' (or &lt;u&gt;''n''&lt;/u&gt; = 1 − ''δ'' − ''iβ'' with the alternative convention mentioned above).&lt;ref name=Attwood/&gt;

==Relations to other quantities==

===Optical path length===
[[File:Soap bubble sky.jpg|thumb|alt=Soap bubble|The colors of a [[soap bubble]] are determined by the [[optical path length]] through the thin soap film in a phenomenon called [[thin-film interference]].]]

[[Optical path length]] (OPL) is the product of the geometric length ''d'' of the path light follows through a system, and the index of refraction of the medium through which it propagates,&lt;ref&gt;R. Paschotta, article on [https://www.rp-photonics.com/optical_thickness.html optical thickness] in the [https://www.rp-photonics.com/encyclopedia.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology], accessed on 2014-09-08&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{OPL} = nd.&lt;/math&gt;
This is an important concept in optics because it determines the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the light and governs [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and [[diffraction]] of light as it propagates. According to [[Fermat's principle]], light rays can be characterized as those curves that [[Mathematical optimization|optimize]] the optical path length.&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;{{rp|68–69}}

===Refraction===
[[File:Snells law.svg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|[[Refraction]] of light at the interface between two media of different refractive indices, with ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the [[phase velocity]] is lower in the second medium (''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), the angle of refraction ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is less than the angle of incidence ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; that is, the ray in the higher-index medium is closer to the normal.]]

When light moves from one medium to another, it changes direction, i.e. it is [[Refraction|refracted]]. If it moves from a medium with refractive index ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to one with refractive index ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with an [[incidence angle]] to the [[surface normal]] of ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the refraction angle ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be calculated from [[Snell's law]]:&lt;ref&gt;R. Paschotta, article on [https://www.rp-photonics.com/refraction.html refraction] in the [https://www.rp-photonics.com/encyclopedia.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology], accessed on 2014-09-08&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

When light enters a material with higher refractive index, the angle of refraction will be smaller than the angle of incidence and the light will be refracted towards the normal of the surface. The higher the refractive index, the closer to the normal direction the light will travel. When passing into a medium with lower refractive index, the light will instead be refracted away from the normal, towards the surface.

===Total internal reflection===
[[File:Total internal reflection of Chelonia mydas.jpg|thumb|alt=A sea turtle being reflected in the water surface above.|[[Total internal reflection]] can be seen at the air-water boundary.]]
If there is no angle ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fulfilling Snell's law, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_1}{n_2} \sin \theta_1 &gt; 1,&lt;/math&gt;
the light cannot be transmitted and will instead undergo [[total internal reflection]].&lt;ref name = bornwolf /&gt;{{rp|49–50}} This occurs only when going to a less optically dense material, i.e., one with lower refractive index. To get total internal reflection the angles of incidence ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; must be larger than the critical angle&lt;ref&gt;R. Paschotta, article on [href=&quot;https://www.rp-photonics.com/total_internal_reflection.html total internal reflection] in the [https://www.rp-photonics.com/encyclopedia.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology], accessed on 2014-09-08&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{c} = \arcsin\!\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)\!.&lt;/math&gt;

===Reflectivity===
Apart from the transmitted light there is also a [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] part. The reflection angle is equal to the incidence angle, and the amount of light that is reflected is determined by the [[reflectivity]] of the surface. The reflectivity can be calculated from the refractive index and the incidence angle with the [[Fresnel equations]], which for [[normal incidence]] reduces to&lt;ref name = bornwolf /&gt;{{rp|44}}
:&lt;math&gt;R_0 = \left|\frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2}\right|^2\!.&lt;/math&gt;

For common glass in air, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.5, and thus about 4% of the incident power is reflected.&lt;ref name=ri-min&gt;{{cite web|last=Swenson|first=Jim|author2=Incorporates Public Domain material from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]|title=Refractive Index of Minerals|publisher=Newton BBS, Argonne National Laboratory, US DOE|date=November 10, 2009&lt;!--[http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/]--&gt; |url =http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/env99/env234.htm|accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other incidence angles the reflectivity will also depend on the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the incoming light. At a certain angle called [[Brewster's angle]], p-polarized light (light with the electric field in the [[plane of incidence]]) will be totally transmitted. Brewster's angle can be calculated from the two refractive indices of the interface as &lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;{{rp|245}}
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{B} = \arctan\!\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)\!.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lenses===
[[File:Lupa.na.encyklopedii.jpg|thumb|alt=A magnifying glass|The [[optical power|power]] of a [[magnifying glass]] is determined by the shape and refractive index of the lens.]]

The [[focal length]] of a [[lens (optics)|lens]] is determined by its refractive index ''n'' and the [[Radius of curvature (optics)|radii of curvature]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of its surfaces. The power of a [[thin lens]] in air is given by the [[Lensmaker's formula]]:&lt;ref&gt;Carl R. Nave, page on the [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/lenmak.html Lens-Maker's Formula] in [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html HyperPhysics], Department of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State University, accessed on 2014-09-08&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1)\!\left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right)\!,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''f'' is the focal length of the lens.

===Microscope resolution===
The [[optical resolution|resolution]] of a good optical [[microscope]] is mainly determined by the [[numerical aperture]] (NA) of its [[objective lens]]. The numerical aperture in turn is determined by the refractive index ''n'' of the medium filling the space between the sample and the lens and the half collection angle of light ''θ'' according to&lt;ref name=Carlsson&gt;{{cite web |first = Kjell |last = Carlsson |url = https://www.kth.se/social/files/542d1251f276544bf2492088/Compendium.Light.Microscopy.pdf |title = Light microscopy |year = 2007 |accessdate = 2015-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NA} = n\sin \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

For this reason [[oil immersion]] is commonly used to obtain high resolution in microscopy. In this technique the objective is dipped into a drop of high refractive index immersion oil on the sample under study.&lt;ref name=Carlsson/&gt;{{rp|14}}

===Relative permittivity and permeability===
The refractive index of electromagnetic radiation equals
:&lt;math&gt;n = \sqrt{\varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \mu_\mathrm{r}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the material's [[relative permittivity]], and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is its [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|relative permeability]].&lt;ref name = bleaney&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bleaney| first1 = B.| authorlink1 = Brebis Bleaney |last2 = Bleaney |first2 = B.I. | title = Electricity and Magnetism | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | edition = Third | date = 1976 | isbn = 0-19-851141-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|229}} The refractive index is used for optics in [[Fresnel equations]] and [[Snell's law]]; while the relative permittivity and permeability are used in [[Maxwell's equations]] and electronics. Most naturally occurring materials are non-magnetic at optical frequencies, that is ''μ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is very close to 1,{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} therefore ''n'' is approximately {{sqrt|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In this particular case, the complex relative permittivity &lt;u&gt;''ε''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, with real and imaginary parts ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and ''ɛ̃''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and the complex refractive index &lt;u&gt;''n''&lt;/u&gt;, with real and imaginary parts ''n'' and ''κ'' (the latter called the &quot;extinction coefficient&quot;), follow the relation
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\varepsilon}_\mathrm{r} = \varepsilon_\mathrm{r} + i\tilde{\varepsilon}_\mathrm{r} = \underline{n}^2 = (n + i\kappa)^2,&lt;/math&gt;
and their components are related by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frederick|last=Wooten|title=Optical Properties of Solids|page=49|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=New York City|year= 1972|isbn=0-12-763450-9}}[http://www.lrsm.upenn.edu/~frenchrh/download/0208fwootenopticalpropertiesofsolids.pdf  (online pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\mathrm{r} = n^2 - \kappa^2,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\varepsilon}_\mathrm{r} = 2n\kappa,&lt;/math&gt;
and:
:&lt;math&gt;n = \sqrt{\frac{|\underline{\varepsilon}_\mathrm{r}| + \varepsilon_\mathrm{r}}{2}},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \sqrt{\frac{|\underline{\varepsilon}_\mathrm{r}| - \varepsilon_\mathrm{r}}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;|\underline{\varepsilon}_\mathrm{r}| = \sqrt{\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}^2 + \tilde{\varepsilon}_\mathrm{r}^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[complex modulus]].

===Density===
[[File:density-nd.GIF|thumb|upright=1.7|alt=A scatter plot showing a strong correlation between glass density and refractive index for different glasses.|Relation between the refractive index and the density of [[silicate glass|silicate]] and [[borosilicate glass]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassproperties.com/refractive_index/|title=Calculation of the Refractive Index of Glasses|work=Statistical Calculation and Development of Glass Properties}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In general, the refractive index of a glass increases with its [[density]]. However, there does not exist an overall linear relation between the refractive index and the density for all silicate and borosilicate glasses. A relatively high refractive index and low density can be obtained with glasses containing light metal oxides such as [[lithium oxide|Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] and [[magnesium oxide|MgO]], while the opposite trend is observed with glasses containing [[lead(II) oxide|PbO]] and [[barium oxide|BaO]] as seen in the diagram at the right.

Many oils (such as [[olive oil]]) and [[ethyl alcohol]] are examples of liquids which are more refractive, but less dense, than water, contrary to the general correlation between density and refractive index.

For gases, ''n'' − 1 is proportional to the density of the gas as long as the chemical composition does not change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://emtoolbox.nist.gov/Wavelength/Documentation.asp | first1 = Jack A. | last1 = Stone
  | first2 = Jay H.  | last2 = Zimmerman | date = 2011-12-28 | website = Engineering metrology toolbox | publisher =  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) | title = Index of refraction of air | accessdate= 2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it is also proportional to the pressure and inversely proportional to the temperature for [[ideal gas law|ideal gases]].

===Group index===
Sometimes, a &quot;group velocity refractive index&quot;, usually called the ''group index'' is defined:{{cn|date=June 2015}}
:&lt;math&gt;n_\mathrm{g} = \frac{\mathrm{c}}{v_\mathrm{g}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[group velocity]]. This value should not be confused with ''n'', which is always defined with respect to the [[phase velocity]]. When the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] is small, the group velocity can be linked to the phase velocity by the relation&lt;ref name = bornwolf&gt;{{cite book | title=Principles of Optics | edition=7th expanded | last1=Born | first1=Max | authorlink1=Max Born | last2=Wolf | first2=Emil | authorlink2=Emil Wolf | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oV80AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22 | isbn=978-0-521-78449-8 | date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}}
:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{g} = v - \lambda\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}\lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' is the wavelength in the medium. In this case the group index can thus be written in terms of the wavelength dependence of the refractive index as
:&lt;math&gt;n_\mathrm{g} = \frac{n}{1 + \frac{\lambda}{n}\frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}}.&lt;/math&gt;

When the refractive index of a medium is known as a function of the vacuum wavelength (instead of the wavelength in the medium), the corresponding expressions for the group velocity and index are (for all values of dispersion) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0030-4018(90)90104-2 | title = Group refractive index measurement by Michelson interferometer

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{g} = \mathrm{c}\!\left(n - \lambda_0 \frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}\lambda_0}\right)^{-1}\!,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_\mathrm{g} = n - \lambda_0 \frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}\lambda_0},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the wavelength in vacuum.

===Momentum (Abraham–Minkowski controversy)===
{{Main|Abraham–Minkowski controversy}}

In 1908, [[Hermann Minkowski]] calculated the momentum ''p'' of a refracted ray as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minkowski|first=Hermann|year=1908|title=Die Grundgleichung für die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Körpern|journal=Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse|pages=53–111|url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/resolveppn/GDZPPN00250152X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{nE}{\mathrm{c}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is energy of the photon, c is the speed of light in vacuum and ''n'' is the refractive index of the medium. In 1909, [[Max Abraham]] proposed the following formula for this calculation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Max|last=Abraham|title=[[:de:s:Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper (Abraham)|Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper]] |journal=[[Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo]]|volume=28|year=1909|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{E}{n\mathrm{c}}.&lt;/math&gt;

A 2010 study suggested that ''both'' equations are correct, with the Abraham version being the [[kinetic momentum]] and the Minkowski version being the [[canonical momentum]], and claims to explain the contradicting experimental results using this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.070401 |title=Resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski Dilemma |first=Stephen |last=Barnett |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |date=2010-02-07 |volume=104 |issue=7 |page=070401 |pmid=20366861|bibcode = 2010PhRvL.104g0401B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other relations===
As shown in the [[Fizeau experiment]], when light is transmitted through a moving medium, its speed relative to a stationary observer is:
:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{\mathrm{c}}{n} + v\!\left(1 - \frac{1}{n^2}\right)\!.&lt;/math&gt;

The refractive index of a substance can be related to its [[polarizability]] with the [[Lorentz–Lorenz equation]] or to the [[molar refractivity|molar refractivities]] of its constituents by the [[Gladstone–Dale relation]].

===Refractivity===
In atmospheric applications, the ''refractivity'' is taken as ''N'' = ''n'' – 1.  Atmospheric refractivity is often expressed as either&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Young | first = A.

[[Molar refractivity]], on the other hand, is a measure of the total [[polarizability]] of a [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance and can be calculated from the refractive index as
:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{M}{\rho} \frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ρ'' is the [[density]], and ''M'' is the [[molar mass]].&lt;ref name = bornwolf /&gt;{{rp|93}}

==Nonscalar, nonlinear, or nonhomogeneous refraction==
So far, we have assumed that refraction is given by linear equations involving a spatially constant, scalar refractive index. These assumptions can break down in different ways, to be described in the following subsections.

===Birefringence===
{{Main|Birefringence}}

[[File:Calcite.jpg|thumb|alt=A crystal giving a double image of the text behind it.|A [[calcite]] crystal laid upon a paper with some letters showing [[double refraction]].]]
[[File:Plastic Protractor Polarized 05375.jpg|thumb|alt=A transparent plastic protractor with smoothly varying bright colors.| Birefringent materials can give rise to colors when placed between crossed polarizers. This is the basis for [[photoelasticity]].]]

In some materials the refractive index depends on the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and propagation direction of the light.&lt;ref&gt;R. Paschotta, article on [https://www.rp-photonics.com/birefringence.html birefringence] in the [https://www.rp-photonics.com/encyclopedia.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology], accessed on 2014-09-09&lt;/ref&gt; This is called [[birefringence]] or optical [[anisotropy]].

In the simplest form, uniaxial birefringence, there is only one special direction in the material. This axis is known as the [[Optic axis of a crystal|optical axis]] of the material.&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;{{rp|230}} Light with linear polarization perpendicular to this axis will experience an ''ordinary'' refractive index ''n''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; while light polarized in parallel will experience an ''extraordinary'' refractive index ''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;{{rp|236}} The birefringence of the material is the difference between these indices of refraction, Δ''n'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;{{rp|237}} Light propagating in the direction of the optical axis will not be affected by the birefringence since the refractive index will be ''n''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; independent of polarization. For other propagation directions the light will split into two linearly polarized beams. For light traveling perpendicularly to the optical axis the beams will have the same direction.&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;{{rp|233}} This can be used to change the polarization direction of linearly polarized light or to convert between linear, circular and elliptical polarizations with [[waveplate]]s.&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;{{rp|237}}

Many [[crystal]]s are naturally birefringent, but [[isotropic]] materials such as [[plastic]]s and [[glass]] can also often be made birefringent by introducing a preferred direction through, e.g., an external force or electric field. This can be utilized in the determination of stresses in structures using [[photoelasticity]]. The birefringent material is then placed between crossed [[polarizers]]. A change in birefringence will alter the polarization and thereby the fraction of light that is transmitted through the second polarizer.

In the more general case of trirefringent materials described by the field of [[crystal optics]], the ''dielectric constant'' is a rank-2 [[tensor]] (a 3 by 3 matrix). In this case the propagation of light cannot simply be described by refractive indices except for polarizations along principal axes.

===Nonlinearity===
{{Main|Nonlinear optics}}
The strong [[electric field]] of high intensity light (such as output of a [[laser]]) may cause a medium's refractive index to vary as the light passes through it, giving rise to [[nonlinear optics]].&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;{{rp|502}} If the index varies quadratically with the field (linearly with the intensity), it is called the [[Kerr effect|optical Kerr effect]] and causes phenomena such as [[self-focusing]] and [[self-phase modulation]].&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;{{rp|264}} If the index varies linearly with the field (a nontrivial linear coefficient is only possible in materials that do not possess [[inversion symmetry]]), it is known as the [[Pockels effect]].&lt;ref name=Hecht/&gt;{{rp|265}}

===Inhomogeneity===
[[File:Grin-lens.png|thumb|alt=Illustration with gradually bending rays of light in a thick slab of glass.|A gradient-index lens with a parabolic variation of refractive index (''n'') with radial distance (''x''). The lens focuses light in the same way as a conventional lens.]]

If the refractive index of a medium is not constant, but varies gradually with position, the material is known as a gradient-index or GRIN medium and is described by [[gradient index optics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hecht&quot;/&gt;{{rp|273}} Light traveling through such a medium can be bent or focused, and this effect can be exploited to produce [[lens (optics)|lenses]], some [[optical fiber]]s and other devices. Introducing GRIN elements in the design of an optical system can greatly simplify the system, reducing the number of elements by as much as a third while maintaining overall performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hecht&quot;/&gt;{{rp|276}} The crystalline lens of the human eye is an example of a GRIN lens with a refractive index varying from about 1.406 in the inner core to approximately 1.386 at the less dense cortex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hecht&quot;/&gt;{{rp|203}} Some common [[mirage]]s are caused by a spatially varying refractive index of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]].

[[File:Pulfrich refraktometer en.png|thumb|alt=Illustration of a refractometer measuring the refraction angle of light passing from a sample into a prism along the interface.|The principle of many refractometers.]]

The refractive index of liquids or solids can be measured with [[refractometer]]s. They typically measure some angle of refraction or the critical angle for total internal reflection. The first [[Abbe refractometer|laboratory refractometer]]s sold commercially were developed by [[Ernst Abbe]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.humboldt.edu/scimus/Essays/EvolAbbeRef/EvolAbbeRef.htm |title = The Evolution of the Abbe Refractometer |publisher = Humboldt State University, Richard A. Paselk |year = 1998 |accessdate = 2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same principles are still used today. In this instrument a thin layer of the liquid to be measured is placed between two prisms. Light is shone through the liquid at incidence angles all the way up to 90°, i.e., light rays [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the surface. The second prism should have an index of refraction higher than that of the liquid, so that light only enters the prism at angles smaller than the critical angle for total reflection. This angle can then be measured either by looking through a [[telescope]], or with a digital [[photodetector]] placed in the focal plane of a lens. The refractive index ''n'' of the liquid can then be calculated from the maximum transmission angle ''θ'' as ''n'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; sin ''θ'', where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is the refractive index of the prism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.refractometer.pl/ | title = Refractometers and refractometry | publisher = Refractometer.pl | year = 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of devices are commonly used in [[chemistry|chemical]] laboratories for identification of [[chemical substance|substances]] and for [[quality control]]. [[Digital handheld refractometer|Handheld variants]] are used in [[agriculture]] by, e.g., [[wine maker]]s to determine [[Brix|sugar content]] in [[grape]] juice, and [[inline process refractometer]]s are used in, e.g., [[chemical industry|chemical]] and [[pharmaceutical industry]] for [[process control]].

In [[gemology]] a different type of refractometer is used to measure index of refraction and birefringence of [[gemstones]]. The gem is placed on a high refractive index prism and illuminated from below. A high refractive index contact liquid is used to achieve optical contact between the gem and the prism. At small incidence angles most of the light will be transmitted into the gem, but at high angles total internal reflection will occur in the prism. The critical angle is normally measured by looking through a telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://gemologyproject.com/wiki/index.php?title=Refractometer |title = Refractometer |publisher = The Gemology Project |accessdate = 2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refractive index variations===
{{Main|Phase-contrast imaging}}
[[File:S cerevisiae under DIC microscopy.jpg|thumb|alt=Yeast cells with dark borders to the upper left and a bright borders to lower right.|A differential interference contrast microscopy image of yeast cells.]]

Unstained biological structures appear mostly transparent under [[Bright-field_microscopy]] as most cellular structures do not attenuate appreciable quantities of light. Nevertheless, the variation in the materials that constitutes these structures also corresponds to a variation in the refractive index.  The following techniques convert such variation into measurable amplitude differences:

To measure the spatial variation of refractive index in a sample [[phase-contrast imaging]] methods are used. These methods measure the variations in [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the light wave exiting the sample. The phase is proportional to the [[optical path length]] the light ray has traversed, and thus gives a measure of the [[integral]] of the refractive index along the ray path. The phase cannot be measured directly at optical or higher frequencies, and therefore needs to be converted into [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] by [[interference (optics)|interference]] with a reference beam. In the visual spectrum this is done using Zernike [[phase-contrast microscopy]], [[differential interference contrast microscopy]] (DIC) or [[interferometry]].

Zernike phase-contrast microscopy introduces a phase shift to the low [[spatial frequency]] components of the [[Real image|image]] with a phase-shifting [[annulus (geometry)|annulus]] in the [[Fourier optics|Fourier plane]] of the sample, so that high-spatial-frequency parts of the image can interfere with the low-frequency reference beam. In DIC the illumination is split up into two beams that are given different polarizations, are phase shifted differently, and are shifted transversely with slightly different amounts. After the specimen, the two parts are made to interfere, giving an image of the derivative of the optical path length in the direction of the difference in transverse shift.&lt;ref name=Carlsson/&gt; In interferometry the illumination is split up into two beams by a [[Beam splitter|partially reflective mirror]]. One of the beams is let through the sample before they are combined to interfere and give a direct image of the phase shifts. If the optical path length variations are more than a wavelength the image will contain fringes.

There exist several [[phase-contrast X-ray imaging]] techniques to determine 2D or 3D spatial distribution of refractive index of samples in the X-ray regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Richard | last = Fitzgerald | title = Phase‐Sensitive X‐Ray Imaging | journal = Physics Today | volume = 53 | page = 23 | date = July 2000 | doi = 10.1063/1.1292471|bibcode = 2000PhT....53g..23F | issue = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The refractive index is a very important property of the components of any [[optical instrument]] that uses refraction. It determines the focusing power of lenses, the dispersive power of prisms, and generally the path of light through the system. It is the increase in refractive index in the [[Core (optical fiber)|core]] that guides the light in an [[optical fiber]], and the variations in refractive index that reduces the reflectivity of a surface treated with an [[anti-reflective coating]].

Since refractive index is a fundamental physical property of a substance, it is often used to identify a particular substance, confirm its purity, or measure its concentration. Refractive index is used to measure solids, liquids, and gases. Most commonly it is used to measure the concentration of a solute in an [[aqueous]] [[solution]]. It can also be used as a useful tool to differentiate between different types of gemstone, due to the unique [[Chatoyancy|chatoyance]] each individual stone displays. A [[refractometer]] is the instrument used to measure refractive index. For a solution of sugar, the refractive index can be used to determine the sugar content (see [[Brix]]).

In [[GPS#Atmospheric effects|GPS]], the index of refraction is utilized in [[Ray tracing (physics)#Radio signals|ray-tracing]] to account for the [[radio propagation]] delay due to the Earth's electrically neutral atmosphere. It is also used in Satellite link design for the [[computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere]].

==Vehicle==
For instance, a given car traveling on a road of a given slope presents a load which the engine must act against. Because air resistance increases with speed, the motor must put out more [[torque]] at a higher speed in order to maintain the speed. By shifting to a higher gear, one may be able to meet the requirement with a higher torque and a lower engine speed, whereas shifting to a lower gear has the opposite effect. Accelerating increases the load, whereas decelerating decreases the load.

==[[Pump]]==
Similarly, the load on a pump depends on the [[hydrostatic head|head]] against which the pump is pumping, and on the size of the pump.

In geometric measurements, '''length''' is the most extended [[dimension]] of an object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=length Princeton.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[International System of Quantities]], length is any quantity with dimension distance.  In other contexts &quot;length&quot; is the measured dimension of an object. For example, it is possible to cut a length of a [[wire]] which is shorter than wire [[:wikt:thickness|thickness]].

Length may be distinguished from [[height]], which is vertical extent, and width or breadth, which are the distance from side to side, measuring across the object at right angles to the length. Length is a measure of one dimension, whereas [[area]] is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and [[volume]] is a measure of three [[dimensions]] (length cubed). In most [[Measurement system|systems of measurement]], the unit of length is a [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]], from which other units are defined.

[[File:Scale kilometres miles.svg|thumb|The [[Metric system|metric]] length of one [[kilometre]] is equivalent to the [[imperial measurement]] of 0.62137 [[mile]]s.]]

== History ==

Measurement has been important ever since humans settled from nomadic lifestyles and started using building materials, occupying land and trading with neighbours. As society has become more technologically oriented, much higher accuracies of measurement are required in an increasingly diverse set of fields, from micro-electronics to interplanetary ranging.&lt;ref&gt;History of Length Measurement, [http://www.npl.co.uk/educate-explore/factsheets/history-of-length-measurement/ National Physical Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the '''oldest units of length measurement''' used in the ancient world was the '[[cubit]]' which was the length of the arm from the tip of the finger to the elbow. This could then be subdivided into shorter units like the foot, hand (which at 4&amp;nbsp;inches is still used today for expressing the height of horses) or finger, or added together to make longer units like the stride. The cubit could vary considerably due to the different sizes of people.

After [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]], length can no longer be thought of being constant in all reference frames. Thus a ruler that is one meter long in one frame of reference will not be one meter long in a reference frame that is travelling at a velocity relative to the first frame. This means length of an object is variable depending on the observer.

== Units ==
In the physical sciences and engineering, when one speaks of &quot;units of length&quot;, the word &quot;length&quot; is synonymous with &quot;[[distance]]&quot;. There are several [[Units of measurement|units]] that are used to [[Measurement|measure]] length. Historically, [[unit of length|units of length]] may have been derived from the lengths of human body parts, the distance travelled in a number of paces, the distance between landmarks or places on the Earth, or arbitrarily on the length of some fixed object.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the [[SI base unit|basic unit]] of length is the [[metre]] and is now defined in terms of the [[speed of light]]. The [[centimetre]] and the [[kilometre]], derived from the metre, are also commonly used units. In [[U.S. customary units]], English or [[Imperial system of units]], commonly used units of length are the [[inch]], the [[foot (length)|foot]], the [[yard]], and the [[mile]].

Units used to denote distances in the vastness of space, as in [[astronomy]], are much longer than those typically used on Earth and include the [[astronomical unit]], the [[light-year]], and the [[parsec]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4848">{{other uses|Intensity (disambiguation)}}
In [[physics]], '''intensity''' is the [[Power (physics)|power]] transferred per unit [[area]], where the area is  an imagined surface that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intensity |title=intensity |work=Merriam-Webster.com |accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[SI]] system, it has units watts per square metre (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It is used most frequently with [[wave]]s (e.g. [[sound]] or [[light]]), in which case the [[time averaging|''average'']] power transfer over one [[Period (physics)|period]] of the wave is used. ''Intensity'' can be applied to other circumstances where energy is transferred. For example, one could calculate the intensity of the [[kinetic energy]] carried by drops of water from a [[garden sprinkler]].

The word &quot;intensity&quot; as used here is not synonymous with &quot;[[wikt:strength|strength]]&quot;, &quot;[[wikt:amplitude|amplitude]]&quot;, &quot;[[wikt:magnitude|magnitude]]&quot;, or &quot;[[wikt:level|level]]&quot;, as it sometimes is in colloquial speech. 

Intensity can be found by taking the [[energy density]] (energy per unit volume) at a point in space and multiplying it by the [[velocity]] at which the energy is moving. The resulting [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] has the units of power divided by area. 

==Mathematical description==
If a [[point source]] is radiating energy in all directions (producing a [[spherical wave]]), and no energy is absorbed or scattered by the medium, then the intensity decreases in proportion to distance from the object squared. This is an example of the [[inverse-square law]]. 

Applying the law of [[conservation of energy]], if the net power emanating is constant,
:&lt;math&gt;P = \int \bold I\, \cdot \mathrm{d}\bold A&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''P'' is the net power radiated, '''I''' is the intensity as a function of position, and d'''A''' is a [[differential element]] of a closed surface that contains the source. 

If one integrates over a surface of uniform intensity ''I'', for instance over a sphere centered around the point source, the equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;P = |I| \cdot A_\mathrm{surf} = |I| \cdot 4\pi r^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;!-- &quot;\,&quot;: other two equations get PNG treatment --&gt;
where ''I'' is the intensity at the surface of the sphere, and ''r'' is the radius of the sphere. (&lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{surf} = 4\pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the expression for the surface area of a sphere). 

Solving for ''I'' gives
:&lt;math&gt;|I| = \frac{P}{A_\mathrm{surf}} = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the medium is damped, then the intensity drops off more quickly than the above equation suggests. 

Anything that can transmit energy can have an intensity associated with it. For a monochromatic propagating wave, such as a [[plane wave]] or a [[Gaussian beam]], if ''E'' is the [[complex amplitude]] of the [[electric field]] via, then the time-averaged [[energy density]] of the wave is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle U \right \rangle = \frac{n^2 \epsilon_0}{2} |E|^2&lt;/math&gt;,
and the local intensity is obtained by multiplying this expression by the wave velocity, c/''n'':
:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{\mathrm{c} n \epsilon_0}{2} |E|^2&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''n'' is the [[refractive index]], c is the [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]] and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]].

For non-monochromatic waves, the intensity contributions of different spectral components can simply be added. The treatment above does not hold for arbitrary electromagnetic fields. For example, an [[evanescent wave]] may have a finite electrical amplitude while not transferring any power. The intensity should then be defined as the magnitude of the [[Poynting vector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology |title=Optical Intensity |url=https://www.rp-photonics.com/optical_intensity.html |publisher=RP Photonics |first=Rüdiger |last=Paschotta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative definitions of &quot;intensity&quot;==
In [[photometry (optics)|photometry]] and [[radiometry]] ''intensity'' has a different meaning: it is the luminous or radiant power ''per unit [[solid angle]]''. This can cause confusion in [[optics]], where ''intensity'' can mean any of [[radiant intensity]], [[luminous intensity]] or [[irradiance]], depending on the background of the person using the term. [[Radiance]] is also sometimes called ''intensity'', especially by astronomers and astrophysicists, and in [[heat transfer]].

The '''neutron magnetic moment''' is the intrinsic [[magnetic dipole moment]] of the [[neutron]], symbol ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Protons]] and neutrons, both [[nucleons]], comprise the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of [[atoms]], and both nucleons behave as small [[magnets]] whose strengths are measured by their magnetic moments.  The neutron interacts with normal matter primarily through the [[nuclear force]] and through its magnetic moment.  The neutron's magnetic moment is exploited to probe the atomic structure of materials using scattering methods and to manipulate the properties of neutron beams in particle accelerators.  The neutron was determined to have a magnetic moment by indirect methods in the mid 1930s.  [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and [[Felix Bloch]] made the first accurate, direct measurement of the neutron's magnetic moment in 1940.  The existence of the neutron's magnetic moment indicates the neutron is not an [[elementary particle]].  For an elementary particle to have an intrinsic magnetic moment, it must have both [[Spin (physics)|spin]] and [[electric charge]].  The neutron has spin 1/2&amp;nbsp;''ħ'', but it has no net charge.  The existence of the neutron's magnetic moment was puzzling and defied a correct explanation until the [[quark model]] for particles was developed in the 1960s.  The neutron is composed of three quarks, and the magnetic moments of these elementary particles combine to give the neutron its magnetic moment.

==Description==
[[File:Neutron spin dipole field.jpg|thumbnail|right|Schematic diagram depicting the spin of the neutron as the black arrow and magnetic field lines associated with the neutron's negative magnetic moment.  The spin of the neutron is upward in this diagram, but the magnetic field lines at the center of the dipole are downward.]]
The best available measurement for the value of the magnetic moment of the neutron is {{nowrap|1=''μ''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|-1.91304272|(45)|u=''μ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;PDG&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beringer|first1=J. |last2=et al.

In [[SI units]], {{nowrap|1=''μ''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|-9.6623647|(23)|e=-27|u=[[Joule|J]]⋅[[Tesla (unit)|T]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.  A magnetic moment is a vector quantity, and the direction of the neutron's magnetic moment is defined by its spin.  The [[torque]] on the neutron resulting from an external magnetic field is towards aligning the neutron's spin vector opposite to the magnetic field vector.

The nuclear magneton is the [[spin magnetic moment]] of a [[Dirac equation|Dirac particle]], a charged, spin 1/2 elementary particle, with a proton's mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.  In SI units, the nuclear magneton is

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{N} = {{e \hbar} \over {2 m_\mathrm{p}}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]] and ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BD&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bjorken | first1=J.D.| last2=Drell| first2=S.D. |title=Relativistic Quantum Mechanics | location=New York | publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=241–246| year=1964 | isbn=0070054932}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The magnetic moment of this particle is parallel to its spin.  Since the neutron has no charge, it should have no magnetic moment by this expression.  The non-zero magnetic moment of the neutron indicates that it is not an elementary particle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hausser&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hausser |first=O.| editor1-first=R. G.| editor1-last=Lerner | editor2-first=G.

Similarly, the fact that the [[proton magnetic moment|magnetic moment of the proton]], {{nowrap|1=''μ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|2.793|u=''μ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, is not equal to 1&amp;nbsp;''μ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that it too is not an elementary particle.&lt;ref name=&quot;BD&quot; /&gt;  Protons and neutrons are composed of [[quark model|quarks]], and the magnetic moments of the quarks can be used to compute the magnetic moments of the nucleons.

Although the neutron interacts with normal matter primarily through either nuclear or magnetic forces, the magnetic interactions are about seven orders of magnitude weaker than the nuclear interactions.  The influence of the neutron's magnetic moment is therefore only apparent for low energy, or slow, neutrons.  Because the value for the magnetic moment is inversely proportional to particle mass, the nuclear magneton is about 1/2000 as large as the [[Bohr magneton]].  The [[electron magnetic moment | magnetic moment of the electron]] is therefore about 1000 times larger than that of the neutron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NIST|title=CODATA values of the fundamental constants|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?muemsmunn|access-date=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The magnetic moment of the [[antineutron]] has the same magnitude as, but has the opposite sign, that of the neutron.&lt;ref name=&quot;KS-RS&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Schreckenbach |first=K.| editor1-first=R. | editor1-last=Stock|title= Encyclopedia of Nuclear Physics and its Applications| location=Weinheim, Germany | publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp;amp; Co. | year=2013 |pages=321–354 |chapter=Physics of the Neutron| isbn= 978-3-527-40742-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==

Soon after the neutron was discovered in 1932, indirect evidence suggested the neutron had an unexpected non-zero value for its magnetic moment.  Attempts to measure the neutron's magnetic moment originated with the discovery by [[Otto Stern]] in 1933 in [[Hamburg]] that the proton had an anomalously large magnetic moment.&lt;ref name=&quot;FS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frisch|first1=R. |last2=Stern|first2=O.|year=1933 |title=Über die magnetische Ablenkung von Wasserstoffmolekülen und das magnetische Moment des Protons.

The refinement and evolution of the Rabi measurements led to the discovery in 1939 that the deuteron also possessed an [[quadrupole|electric quadrupole moment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rigden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KRRZ&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kellogg|first1=J.M.|last2=Rabi |first2=I.I. |last3=Ramsey|first3=N.F. |last4=Zacharias|first4=J.R. |year=1939 |title=An electrical quadrupole moment of the deuteron|journal=Physical Review|url=http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.55.318 |volume=55 |pages=318–319 |doi=10.1103/physrev.55.318 |accessdate=May 9, 2015|bibcode = 1939PhRv...55..318K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This electrical property of the deuteron had been interfering with the measurements by the Rabi group.

== Neutron ''g''-factor and gyromagnetic ratio ==
The magnetic moment of a nucleon is sometimes expressed in terms of its [[g-factor (physics)|''g''-factor]], a dimensionless scalar. The convention defining the ''g''-factor for composite particles, such as the neutron or proton, is

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\mu} = \frac{g \mu_\mathrm{N}}{\hbar}\boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''μ''''' is the intrinsic magnetic moment, '''''I''''' is the spin [[angular momentum]], and ''g'' is the effective ''g''-factor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Povh&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1=Povh | first1=B.| last2=Rith| first2=K.| last3=Scholz| first3=C.| last4=Zetsche| first4=F. |title=Particles and Nuclei: An Introduction to the Physical Concepts | location=Berlin | publisher=Springer-Verlag |pages=74–75,259–260| year=2002 | isbn=978-3-540-43823-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HC_qCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA389#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate=May 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the g-factor is dimensionless, for composite particles it is defined relative to the natural unit of the nuclear magneton.  For the neutron, '''''I''''' is 1/2&amp;nbsp;''ħ'', so the neutron's ''g''-factor, symbol ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, is {{val|-3.82608545|(90)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NIST|title=CODATA values of the fundamental constants|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?gnn|accessdate=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gyromagnetic ratio]], symbol [[Gamma|γ]], of a particle or system is the [[ratio]] of its magnetic moment to its spin angular momentum, or

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\mu} = \gamma\boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt;

For nucleons, the ratio is conventionally written in terms of the proton mass and charge, by the formula

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{g \mu_\mathrm{N}}{\hbar} = g\frac{e}{2m_\text{p}}&lt;/math&gt;

The neutron's gyromagnetic ratio, symbol γ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, is {{val|-1.83247179|(43)|e=8|u=s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅[[Tesla (unit)|T]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NIST|title=CODATA values of the fundamental constants|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?gamman|accessdate=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gyromagnetic ratio is also the ratio between the observed angular frequency of [[Larmor precession]] (in rad s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the strength of the magnetic field in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Physical significance ==
[[File:Larmour Precession B spin negativeQ.jpg|thumb|upright|Direction of Larmor precession for a neutron.  The central arrow denotes the magnetic field, the small red arrow the spin of the neutron.]]
When a neutron is put into a magnetic field produced by an external source, it is subject to a torque tending to orient its magnetic moment parallel to the field (hence its spin antiparallel to the field).&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{ cite book |title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials |author=B.

Since the neutron has spin angular momentum, this torque will cause the neutron to [[Precession|precess]] with a well-defined frequency, called the [[Larmor precession|Larmor frequency]]. It is this phenomenon that enables the measurement of nuclear properties through nuclear magnetic resonance. The Larmor frequency can be determined by the product of the gyromagnetic ratio with the magnetic field strength. Since the sign of γ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is negative, the neutron's spin angular momentum precesses counterclockwise about the direction of the external magnetic field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levitt&quot;&gt;{{ cite book |title=Spin dynamics: basics of nuclear magnetic resonance |author=M.

The magnetic moment of the neutron has been exploited to probe the properties of matter using [[inelastic neutron scattering|scattering]] or [[neutron diffraction|diffraction]] techniques. These methods provide information that is complementary to [[X-ray spectroscopy]].

Since neutrons are neutral particles, they do not have to overcome [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb repulsion]] as they approach charged targets, as experienced by protons or [[alpha particle]]s. Neutrons can deeply penetrate matter. On the other hand, without an electric charge, [[Particle beam|neutron beams]] cannot be controlled by the conventional electromagnetic methods employed for [[particle accelerators]].

Since an atomic nucleus consists of a bound state of protons and neutrons, the magnetic moments of the nucleons contribute to the [[nuclear magnetic moment]], or the magnetic moment for the nucleus as a whole.  The nuclear magnetic moment also includes contributions from the orbital motion of the nucleons.  The deuteron has the simplest example of a nuclear magnetic moment, with measured value 0.857&amp;nbsp;''µ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;.  This value is within 3% of the sum of the moments of the proton and neutron, which gives 0.879&amp;nbsp;''µ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;. In this calculation, the spins of the nucleons are aligned, but their magnetic moments offset because of the neutron's negative magnetic moment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Semat&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Semat |first=Henry|title= Introduction to Atomic and Nuclear Physics: 5th edition| location=London|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston | year=1972 |pages=556 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WJvTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA556&amp;lpg=PA556&amp;dq=deuterium+magnetic+dipole+moment+sum+of+proton+and+neutron&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9xau-o8fUa&amp;sig=zemjecXINynQ_bZr88WqoK_whwo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YJxLVev5GYq1oQSeuYGIDw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=deuterium%20magnetic%20dipole%20moment%20sum%20of%20proton%20and%20neutron&amp;f=false| isbn=978-1-4615-9701-8 | access-date=May 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anomalous magnetic moments and meson physics ==

The anomalous values for the magnetic moments of the nucleons presented a theoretical quandary for the 30 years from the time of their discovery in the early 1930s to the development of the quark model in the early 1960s.  Considerable theoretical efforts were expended in trying to understand the origins of these magnetic moments, but the failures of these theories were glaring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pais&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Pais |first=Abraham |date=1986 |title=Inward Bound |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=299 |isbn= 0198519974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the theoretical focus was on developing a nuclear-force equivalence to the remarkably successful theory explaining the small anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.

The physical picture is that the ''effective'' magnetic moment of the electron results from the contributions of the &quot;bare&quot; electron, which is the Dirac particle, and the cloud of &quot;virtual,&quot; short-lived electron–positron pairs and photons that surround this particle as a consequence of QED.

==Quark model for nucleon magnetic moments==

In the [[quark model]] for [[hadrons]], the neutron is composed of one up quark (charge +2/3&amp;nbsp;''e'') and two down quarks (charge −1/3&amp;nbsp;''e'').&lt;ref&gt;

This result combines the intrinsic magnetic moments of the quarks with their orbital magnetic moments, and assumes the three quarks are in a particular, dominant quantum state.

{{essay-like|date=September 2012}}

'''Relative humidity''' (abbreviated RH) is the ratio of the [[partial pressure]] of water vapor to the [[equilibrium vapor pressure]] of water at the same temperature. Relative humidity depends on temperature and the pressure of the system of interest.

== Definition ==
The relative humidity &lt;math&gt; \left(\phi\right) &lt;/math&gt; of an air-water mixture is defined as the ratio of the [[partial pressure]] of water vapor &lt;math&gt; \left({e_w}\right) &lt;/math&gt; in the mixture to the [[equilibrium vapor pressure]] of water &lt;math&gt; \left({{e^*}_w}\right) &lt;/math&gt; at a given temperature:&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;&gt;Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W, ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'' (7th Edition), [[McGraw-Hill]], ISBN 0-07-049841-5 , Eqn 12-7&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \phi = {{e_w} \over {{e^*}_w}}&lt;/math&gt; 

Relative humidity is normally expressed as a percentage; a higher percentage means that the air-water mixture is more humid.

== Significance ==

=== Climate control ===
Climate control refers to the control of temperature and relative humidity for human comfort, health, and safety; for the technical requirements of machines and processes; and in buildings, vehicles, and other enclosed spaces.

=== Comfort ===
Humans are sensitive to humidity because the human body uses [[evaporative cooling]], enabled by perspiration, as the primary mechanism to rid itself of waste heat. Perspiration evaporates from the skin more slowly under humid conditions than under arid conditions. Because humans perceive a low ''rate of heat transfer'' from the body to be equivalent to a higher air temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Astro | publisher = Cornell | type = Q&amp;A | contribution = Curious | url = http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=86}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the body experiences greater distress of waste heat burden at high humidity than at lower humidity, given equal temperatures.

For example, if the air temperature is 24 °C (75 °F) and the relative humidity is zero percent, then the air temperature feels like 21 °C (69 °F).&lt;ref name=&quot;hswref&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title = Science | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/question651.htm | contribution = What is relative humidity and how does it affect how I feel outside? | publisher = How stuff works | type = Q&amp;A}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the relative humidity is 100 percent at the same air temperature, then it feels like 27 °C (80 °F).&lt;ref name = &quot;hswref&quot; /&gt; In other words, if the air is 24 °C (75 °F) and contains saturated water vapor, then the human body cools itself at the same rate as it would if it were 27 °C (80 °F) and dry.&lt;ref name=&quot;hswref&quot; /&gt; The [[heat index]] and the [[humidex]] are indices that reflect the combined effect of temperature and humidity on the cooling effect of the atmosphere on the human body.

Humans can be comfortable within a wide range of humidities depending on the temperature—from thirty to seventy percent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Gilmore| first= CP | title= More Comfort for Your Heating Dollar| journal= Popular Science|date=September 1972 | page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but ideally between 50%&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001412.html | publisher = Pearson | title = Information please | type = database | year = 2007 | contribution = Winter Indoor Comfort and Relative Humidity | quote = …by increasing the relative humidity to above 50% within the above temperature range, 80% or more of all average dressed persons would feel comfortable. | accessdate = 2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/relative-humidity-d_895.html | title = The engineering toolbox | contribution = Recommended relative humidity level | quote = Relative humidity above 60% feels uncomfortable wet. Human comfort requires the relative humidity to be in the range 25–60% RH. | accessdate = 2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buildings ===
For climate control in buildings using [[HVAC]] systems, the key is to maintain the relative humidity at a comfortable range—low enough to be comfortable but high enough to avoid problems associated with very dry air.

When the temperature is high and the relative humidity is low, evaporation of water is rapid; soil dries, wet clothes hung on a line or rack dry quickly, and perspiration readily evaporates from the skin. Wooden furniture can shrink, causing the paint that covers these surfaces to fracture.

When the temperature is low and the relative humidity is high, evaporation of water is slow. When relative humidity approaches 100 percent, condensation can occur on surfaces, leading to problems with mold, corrosion, decay, and other moisture-related deterioration.

Certain production and technical processes and treatments in factories, laboratories, hospitals, and other facilities require specific relative humidity levels to be maintained using humidifiers, [[dehumidifier]]s and associated control systems.

=== Vehicles ===
The basic principles for buildings, above, also apply to vehicles. In addition, there may be safety considerations. For instance, high humidity inside a [[vehicle]] can lead to problems of condensation, such as misting of [[windshield]]s and [[Short circuit|shorting]] of electrical components.

In sealed vehicles and [[pressure vessel]]s such as pressurized [[airliner]]s, [[submersible]]s and [[spacecraft]], these considerations may be critical to safety, and complex [[environmental control system]]s including equipment to maintain [[pressure]] are needed. Airliners operate with low internal relative humidity, often under 10%, especially on long flights. The low humidity is a consequence of drawing in the very cold air with a low [[Humidity#Absolute humidity|absolute humidity]], which is found at airliner cruising altitudes. Subsequent warming of this air lowers its relative humidity. This causes discomfort such as sore eyes, dry skin, and drying out of [[mucosa]], but humidifiers are not employed to raise it to comfortable mid-range levels because the volume of water required to be carried on board can be a significant weight penalty. As airliners descend from colder altitudes into warmer air (perhaps even flying through clouds a few thousand feet above the ground), the ambient relative humidity can increase dramatically. Some of this moist air is usually drawn into the pressurized aircraft cabin and into other non-pressurized areas of the aircraft and condenses on the cold aircraft skin. Liquid water can usually be seen running along the aircraft skin, both on the inside and outside of the cabin. Because of the drastic changes in relative humidity inside the vehicle, components must be qualified to operate in those environments. The recommended environmental qualifications for most commercial aircraft components is listed in RTCA DO-160.

=== Aviation ===
Cold humid air can promote the formation of ice, which is a danger to aircraft as it affects the wing profile and increases weight. Carbureted engines have a further danger of ice forming inside the [[carburetor]]. Aviation weather reports ([[METAR]]s) therefore include an indication of relative humidity, usually in the form of the [[dew point]].

In addition, air with higher humidity is less dense, providing lower lift and lower propeller or turbine efficiency (this is somewhat offset by decreased drag). Pilots must take humidity into account when calculating takeoff distances because high humidity will require longer runways and will decrease the climb gradient.

Density altitude is the altitude relative to the standard atmosphere conditions (International Standard Atmosphere) at which the air density would be equal to the indicated air density at the place of observation, or, in other words, the height when measured in terms of the density of the air rather than the distance from the ground. &quot;Density Altitude&quot; is the pressure altitude adjusted for non-standard temperature.

An increase in temperature, and, to a much lesser degree, humidity will cause an increase in density altitude. Thus, in hot and humid conditions, the density altitude at a particular location may be significantly higher than the true altitude.

== Measurement ==
A [[hygrometer]] (illustrated) is a device used for measuring the humidity of air.

The humidity of an air-water vapor mixture is determined through the use of psychrometric charts if both the [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb temperature]] (''T'') and the [[Wet-bulb temperature|wet bulb temperature]] (''T&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'') of the mixture are known. These quantities are readily estimated by using a sling [[hygrometer|psychrometer]].

There are several empirical formulas that can be used to estimate the equilibrium vapor pressure of water vapor as a function of temperature. The [[Antoine equation]] is among the least complex of these, having only three parameters (A, B, and C). Other formulas, such as the [[Goff-Gratch Equation|Goff-Gratch equation]] and the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation#Meteorology and climatology|Magnus-Tetens approximation]], are more complicated but yield better accuracy{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

The formula presented by [[Arden Buck equation|Buck]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.public.iastate.edu/~bkh/teaching/505/arden_buck_sat.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly encountered in the literature and provides a reasonable balance between complexity and accuracy{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}:

:::&lt;math&gt; {{e^*}_w} = (1.0007 + 3.46 \times 10^{-6} P) \times (6.1121) e^{\left(\frac {17.502 T} {240.97 + T}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is the dry bulb temperature expressed in degrees Celsius ('''°C'''), &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is the absolute pressure expressed in millibar, and &lt;math&gt; {{e^*}_w} &lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium vapor pressure expressed in millibars.
Buck has reported that the maximum relative error is less than 0.20% between -20°C and +50°C when this particular form of the generalized formula is used to estimate the equilibrium vapor pressure of water.

== Misconception ==
The notion of air &quot;holding&quot; water vapor or being &quot;saturated&quot; by it is often mentioned in connection with the concept of relative humidity. This, however, is misleading—the amount of water vapor that enters (or can enter) a given space at a given temperature is independent of the amount of air (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) that is present. Indeed, a vacuum has the same equilibrium capacity to hold water vapor as the same volume filled with air; both are given by the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at the given temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~stevenb/vapor/ Water Vapor Myths: A Brief Tutorial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/Bad/BadFAQ/BadCloudsFAQ.html Bad Clouds FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pressure dependence ==
The relative humidity of an air-water system is dependent not only on the temperature but also on the absolute pressure of the system of interest. This dependence is demonstrated by considering the air-water system shown below. The system is closed (i.e., no matter enters or leaves the system).

[[File:Changes in Relative Humidity.png]]

If the system at State A is isobarically heated (heating with no change in system pressure) then the relative humidity of the system decreases because the equilibrium vapor pressure of water increases with increasing temperature. This is shown in State B.

If the system at State A is isothermally compressed (compressed with no change in system temperature) then the relative humidity of the system increases because the partial pressure of water in the system increases with the volume reduction. This is shown in State C. Above 202.64 kPa, the RH would exceed 100% and water may begin to condense.

If the pressure of State A was changed by simply adding more dry air, without changing the volume, the relative humidity would not change.

Therefore, a change in relative humidity can be explained by a change in system temperature, a change in the volume of the system, or change in both of these system properties.

=== Enhancement factor ===
The enhancement factor &lt;math&gt; \left(f_w\right) &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ratio of the saturated vapor pressure of water in moist air &lt;math&gt; \left(e'_w\right) &lt;/math&gt; to the saturated vapor pressure of pure water.

:::&lt;math&gt; f_W = \frac {e'_w} {e^*_w} &lt;/math&gt;

The enhancement factor is equal to unity for ideal gas systems. However, in real systems the interaction effects between gas molecules result in a small increase of the equilibrium vapor pressure of water in air relative to equilibrium vapor pressure of pure water vapor. Therefore, the enhancement factor is normally slightly greater than unity for real systems.

The enhancement factor is commonly used to correct the equilibrium vapor pressure of water vapor when empirical relationships, such as those developed by Wexler, Goff, and Gratch, are used to estimate the properties of psychrometric systems.

Buck has reported that, at sea level, the vapor pressure of water in saturated moist air amounts to an increase of approximately 0.5% over the equilibrium vapor pressure of pure water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buck&quot;&gt;Arden L.

The term relative humidity is reserved for systems of water vapor in air. The term ''relative saturation'' is used to describe the analogous property for systems consisting of a condensable phase other than water in a non-condensable phase other than air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blowers.chee.arizona.edu/201project/GLsys.interrelatn.pg1.HTML]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Relative Humidity.png|thumb|right]]

A gas in this context is referred to as saturated when the vapor pressure of water in the air is at the equilibrium vapor pressure for water vapor at the temperature of the gas and water vapor mixture; liquid water (and ice, at the appropriate temperature) will fail to lose mass through evaporation when exposed to saturated air. It may also correspond to the possibility of [[dew]] or [[fog]] forming, within a space that lacks temperature differences among its portions, for instance in response to decreasing temperature. Fog consists of very minute droplets of liquid, primarily held aloft by isostatic motion (in other words, the droplets fall through the air at terminal velocity, but as they are very small, this terminal velocity is very small too, so it doesn't look to us like they are falling, and they seem to be held aloft).

The statement that relative humidity (RH%) can never be above 100%, while a fairly good guide, is not absolutely accurate, without a more sophisticated definition of humidity than the one given here. An arguable exception is the [[Wilson cloud chamber]], which uses, in nuclear physics experiments, an extremely brief state of &quot;[[supersaturation]]&quot; to accomplish its function.

For a given [[dew point]] and its corresponding [[absolute humidity]], the relative humidity will change inversely, albeit nonlinearly, with the [[temperature]]. This is because the partial pressure of water increases with temperature &amp;ndash; the operative principle behind everything from [[hair dryer]]s to [[dehumidifier]]s.

Due to the increasing potential for a higher water vapor partial pressure at higher air temperatures, the water content of air at sea level can get as high as 3% by mass at 30 °C (86 °F) compared to no more than about 0.5% by mass at 0 °C (32 °F). This explains the low levels (in the absence of measures to add moisture) of humidity in heated structures during winter, resulting in dry [[Human skin|skin]], [[itch]]y [[Human eye|eye]]s, and persistence of [[static electricity|static electric]] charges. Even with saturation (100% relative humidity) outdoors, heating of infiltrated outside air that comes indoors raises its moisture capacity, which lowers relative humidity and increases evaporation rates from moist surfaces indoors (including human bodies and household plants.)

Similarly, during summer in humid climates a great deal of liquid water condenses from air cooled in air conditioners. Warmer air is cooled below its dew point, and the excess water vapor condenses. This phenomenon is the same as that which causes water droplets to form on the outside of a cup containing an ice-cold drink.

A useful rule of thumb is that the maximum [[absolute humidity]] doubles for every 20&amp;nbsp;°F or 10&amp;nbsp;°C increase in temperature. Thus, the relative humidity will drop by a factor of 2 for each 20&amp;nbsp;°F or 10&amp;nbsp;°C increase in temperature, assuming conservation of absolute moisture. For example, in the range of normal temperatures, air at 68&amp;nbsp;°F or 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 50% relative humidity will become saturated if cooled to 50&amp;nbsp;°F or 10&amp;nbsp;°C, its [[dew point]], and 41&amp;nbsp;°F or 5&amp;nbsp;°C air at 80% relative humidity warmed to 68&amp;nbsp;°F or 20&amp;nbsp;°C will have a relative humidity of only 29% and feel dry. By comparison, thermal comfort standard [[ASHRAE 55]] requires systems designed to control humidity to maintain a dew point of 16.8 °C (62.2 °F) though no lower humidity limit is established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = ASHRAE Standard 55|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Water vapor is a lighter gas than other gaseous components of air at the same temperature, so humid air will tend to rise by natural [[convection]]. This is a mechanism behind [[thunderstorms]] and other [[weather]] phenomena. Relative humidity is often mentioned in [[weather forecasting|weather forecasts]] and reports, as it is an indicator of the likelihood of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], dew, or fog. In hot summer [[weather]], it also increases the [[heat index|apparent temperature]] to [[human]]s (and other [[animal]]s) by hindering the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin as the relative humidity rises. This effect is calculated as the [[heat index]] or [[humidex]].

A device used to measure humidity is called a [[hygrometer]]; one used to regulate it is called a [[humidistat]], or sometimes [[hygrostat]]. (These are [[analogous]] to a [[thermometer]] and [[thermostat]] for temperature, respectively.)

A '''temperature''' is an objective comparative measure of hot or cold. It is measured by a [[thermometer]], which may work through the bulk behavior of a thermometric material, detection of [[thermal radiation]], or particle [[kinetic energy]]. Several [[Conversion of units of temperature|scales and units]] exist for measuring temperature, the most common being [[Celsius]] (denoted °C; formerly called ''centigrade''), [[Fahrenheit]] (denoted °F), and, especially in science, [[Kelvin]] (denoted K).

The coldest theoretical temperature is [[absolute zero]], at which the [[kinetic theory|thermal motion]] in matter would be zero. However, an actual physical system or object can never attain a temperature of absolute zero. Absolute zero is denoted as 0&amp;nbsp;K on the Kelvin scale, −273.15&amp;nbsp;°C on the Celsius scale, and  −459.67&amp;nbsp;°F on the Fahrenheit scale.

The [[kinetic theory]] offers a valuable but limited account of the behavior of the materials of macroscopic systems, especially of [[fluid]]s. It indicates the [[#Kinds of temperature scale|absolute temperature]] as proportional to the average kinetic energy of the random microscopic motions of their constituent microscopic particles such as electrons, atoms, and molecules.

[[File:Thermally Agitated Molecule.gif|280px|thumb|right|Thermal vibration of a segment of [[protein]] [[alpha helix]]: The [[amplitude]] of the vibrations increases with temperature.]]

Temperature is important in all fields of natural science, including [[physics]], [[geology]], [[chemistry]], [[atmospheric sciences]], [[medicine]], and [[biology]]—as well as most aspects of daily life.

==Effects of temperature==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}

Many physical processes are affected by temperature, such as
* physical properties of materials including the [[Phases of matter|phase]] ([[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]]eous or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]), [[density]], [[solubility]], [[vapor pressure]], [[electrical conductivity]]
* rate and extent to which [[chemical reaction]]s occur
* the amount and properties of [[thermal radiation]] emitted from the surface of an object
* [[speed of sound]] is a function of the square root of the absolute temperature

==Temperature scales==
{{see also|Scale of temperature}}
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}

Temperature scales differ in two ways: the point chosen as zero degrees, and the magnitudes of incremental units or degrees on the scale.

The [[Celsius]] scale (°C) is used for common temperature measurements in most of the world. It is an empirical scale. It developed by a historical progress, which led to its zero point {{gaps|0|°C}} being defined by the freezing point of water, with additional degrees defined so that {{gaps|100|°C}} was the boiling point of water, both at sea-level atmospheric pressure. Because of the 100 degree interval, it is called a centigrade scale.&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, W.E.K. (1966), pp. 89–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the standardization of the kelvin in the International System of Units, it has subsequently been redefined in terms of the equivalent fixing points on the Kelvin scale, and so that a temperature increment of one degree Celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin, though they differ by an additive offset of 273.15.

The United States commonly uses the [[Fahrenheit]] scale, on which water freezes at 32&amp;nbsp;°F and boils at 212&amp;nbsp;°F at sea-level atmospheric pressure.

Many scientific measurements use the [[kelvin temperature scale]] (unit symbol &amp;nbsp;K), named in honor of the Scottish physicist who first defined it. It is a thermodynamic or [[absolute temperature]] scale. Its zero point, {{gaps|0|K}}, is defined to coincide with coldest physically-possible temperature (called [[absolute zero]]). Its degrees are defined [[#Definition of the Kelvin scale|through thermodynamics]].  The temperature of absolute zero occurs at  {{gaps|0|K}} = {{gaps|-273.15|°C}} (or −459.67&amp;nbsp;°F), and the freezing point of water at sea-level atmospheric pressure occurs at {{gaps|273.15|K}} = {{gaps|0|°C}}.

The [[International System of Units]] (SI) defines a scale and unit for the kelvin or [[thermodynamic temperature]] by using the reliably reproducible temperature of the [[triple point]] of water as a second reference point (the first reference point being 0 K at absolute zero). The triple point is a singular state with its own unique and invariant temperature and pressure, along with, for a fixed mass of water in a vessel of fixed volume, an autonomically and stably self-determining partition into three mutually contacting phases, vapour, liquid, and solid, dynamically depending only on the total internal energy of the mass of water. For historical reasons, the triple point temperature of water is fixed at 273.16 units of the measurement increment.

==Thermodynamic approach to temperature==
Temperature is one of the principal quantities in the study of [[thermodynamics]].

===Kinds of temperature scale===
There is a variety of kinds of temperature scale. It may be convenient to classify them as empirically and theoretically based. Empirical temperature scales are historically older, while theoretically based scales arose in the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truesdell 1980&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, T.J. (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Empirically based scales====
Empirically based temperature scales rely directly on measurements of simple physical properties of materials. For example, the length of a column of mercury, confined in a glass-walled capillary tube, is dependent largely on temperature, and is the basis of the very useful mercury-in-glass thermometer. Such scales are valid only within convenient ranges of temperature. For example, above the boiling point of mercury, a mercury-in-glass thermometer is impracticable. Most materials expand with temperature increase, but some materials, such as water, contract with temperature increase over some specific range, and then they are hardly useful as thermometric materials. A material is of no use as a thermometer near one of its phase-change temperatures, for example its boiling-point.

In spite of these restrictions, most generally used practical thermometers are of the empirically based kind. Especially, it was used for [[calorimetry]], which contributed greatly to the discovery of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, empirical thermometry has serious drawbacks when judged as a basis for theoretical physics. Empirically based thermometers, beyond their base as simple direct measurements of ordinary physical properties of thermometric materials, can be re-calibrated, by use of theoretical physical reasoning, and this can extend their range of adequacy.

====Theoretically based scales====
Theoretically based temperature scales are based directly on theoretical arguments, especially those of thermodynamics, of kinetic theory, and of quantum mechanics. They rely on theoretical properties of idealized devices and materials. They are more or less comparable with practically feasible physical devices and materials. Theoretically based temperature scales are used to provide calibrating standards for practical empirically based thermometers.

The accepted fundamental thermodynamic temperature scale is the Kelvin scale, based on an ideal cyclic process envisaged for a [[Carnot heat engine]].

An ideal material on which a temperature scale can be based is the [[ideal gas]]. The pressure exerted by a fixed volume and mass of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its temperature. Some natural gases show so nearly ideal properties over suitable temperature ranges that they can be used for thermometry; this was important during the development of thermodynamics, and is still of practical importance today.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, T.J. (1983), pp. 61–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schooley, J.F. (1986), pp. 115–138.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal gas thermometer is, however, not theoretically perfect for thermodynamics. This is because the [[Ideal gas#Entropy|entropy of an ideal gas]] at its absolute zero of temperature is not a positive semi-definite quantity, which puts the gas in violation of the third law of thermodynamics. The physical reason is that the ideal gas law, exactly read, refers to the limit of infinitely high temperature and zero pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tschoegl, N.W. (2000), p.88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurement of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from an ideal three-dimensional [[black body]] can provide an accurate temperature measurement because the frequency of maximum spectral radiance of black-body radiation is directly proportional to the temperature of the black body; this is known as [[Wien's displacement law]], and has a theoretical explanation in [[Planck's law]] and the [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose–Einstein law]].

Measurement of the spectrum of noise-power produced by an electrical resistor can also provide an accurate temperature measurement. The resistor has two terminals and is in effect a one-dimensional body. The Bose-Einstein law for this case indicates that the noise-power is directly proportional to the temperature of the resistor and to the value of its resistance and to the noise band-width. In a given frequency band, the noise-power has equal contributions from every frequency, and is called [[Johnson noise]]. If the value of the resistance is known then the temperature can be found.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, T.J. (1983), pp. 98–107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schooley, J.F. (1986), pp. 138–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

If molecules, or atoms, or electrons, are emitted from a material and their velocities are measured, the spectrum of their velocities often nearly obeys a theoretical law called the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], which gives a well-founded measurement of temperatures for which the law holds.&lt;ref&gt;Zeppenfeld, M., Englert, B.G.U., Glöckner, R., Prehn, A., Mielenz, M., Sommer, C., van Buuren, L.D., Motsch, M., Rempe, G. (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; There have not yet been successful experiments of this same kind that directly use the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution]] for thermometry, but perhaps that will be achieved in future.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Absolute thermodynamic scale====
The Kelvin scale is called '''absolute''' for two reasons. One is Kelvin's, that its formal character is independent of the properties of particular materials. The other reason is that its zero is in a sense absolute, in that it indicates absence of microscopic classical motion of the constituent particles of matter, so that they have a limiting specific heat of zero for zero temperature, according to the third law of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, a Kelvin temperature has a definite numerical value, that has been arbitrarily chosen by tradition. This numerical value also depends on the properties of water, which has a [[Triple point#Triple points of water|gas–liquid–solid triple point]] that can be reliably reproduced as a standard experimental phenomenon. The choice of this triple point is also arbitrary and by convention. The Kelvin scale is also called the '''thermodynamic scale'''.

===Definition of the Kelvin scale===
The thermodynamic definition of temperature is due to Kelvin.

It is framed in terms of an idealized device called a [[Carnot engine]], imagined to define a continuous cycle of states of its working body. The cycle is imagined to run so slowly that at each point of the cycle the working body is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. There are four limbs in such a [[Carnot cycle]]. The engine consists of four bodies. The main one is called the working body. Two of them are called heat reservoirs, so large that their respective non-deformation variables are not changed by transfer of energy as heat through a wall permeable only to heat to the working body. The fourth body is able to exchange energy with the working body only through adiabatic work; it may be called the work reservoir. The substances and states of the two heat reservoirs should be chosen so that they are not in thermal equilibrium with one another. This means that they must be at different fixed temperatures, one, labeled here with the number 1, hotter than the other, labeled here with the number 2. This can be tested by connecting the heat reservoirs successively to an auxiliary empirical thermometric body that starts each time at a convenient fixed intermediate temperature. The thermometric body should be composed of a material that has a strictly monotonic relation between its chosen empirical thermometric variable and the amount of adiabatic isochoric work done on it. In order to settle the structure and sense of operation of the Carnot cycle, it is convenient to use such a material also for the working body; because most materials are of this kind, this is hardly a restriction of the generality of this definition. The Carnot cycle is considered to start from an initial condition of the working body that was reached by the completion of a reversible adiabatic compression. From there, the working body is initially connected by a wall permeable only to heat to the heat reservoir number 1, so that during the first limb of the cycle it expands and does work on the work reservoir. The second limb of the cycle sees the working body expand adiabatically and reversibly, with no energy exchanged as heat, but more energy being transferred as work to the work reservoir. The third limb of the cycle sees the working body connected, through a wall permeable only to heat, to the heat reservoir 2, contracting and accepting energy as work from the work reservoir. The cycle is closed by reversible adiabatic compression of the working body, with no energy transferred as heat, but energy being transferred to it as work from the work reservoir.

With this set-up, the four limbs of the reversible Carnot cycle are characterized by amounts of energy transferred, as work from the working body to the work reservoir, and as heat from the heat reservoirs to the working body. The amounts of energy transferred as heat from the heat reservoirs are measured through the changes in the non-deformation variable of the working body, with reference to the previously known properties of that body, the amounts of work done on the work reservoir, and the first law of thermodynamics. The amounts of energy transferred as heat respectively from reservoir 1 and from reservoir 2 may then be denoted respectively {{math|''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Then the absolute or thermodynamic temperatures, {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}},  of the reservoirs are defined so that to be such that
:&lt;math&gt;T_1 / T_2 = - Q_1 / Q_2 \,\,\,.\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(1)&lt;/math&gt;

Kelvin's original work postulating absolute temperature was published in 1848. It was based on the work of Carnot, before the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics. Kelvin wrote in his 1848 paper that his scale was absolute in the sense that it was defined &quot;independently of the properties of any particular kind of matter.&quot; His definitive publication, which sets out the definition just stated, was printed in 1853, a paper read in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Thomson, W. (Lord Kelvin)]] (1848).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Thomson, W. (Lord Kelvin)]] (1851).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J. R. Partington|Partington, J.R.]] (1949), pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, J.K., Miller, A.R. (1928/1960), pp. 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition rests on the physical assumption that there are readily available walls permeable only to heat. In his detailed definition of a wall permeable only to heat, [[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]] includes several ideas. The non-deformation state variable of a closed system is represented as a real number. A state of thermal equilibrium between two closed systems connected by a wall permeable only to heat means that a certain mathematical relation holds between the state variables, including the respective non-deformation variables, of those two systems (that particular mathematical relation is regarded by Buchdahl as a preferred statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics).&lt;ref&gt;Buchdahl, H.A (1986). On the redundancy of the zeroth law of thermodynamics, ''J. Phys. A, Math. Gen.'', '''19''': L561–L564.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, referring to thermal contact equilibrium, &quot;whenever each of the systems {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is made to reach equilibrium with a third system {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} under identical conditions, the systems {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are in mutual equilibrium.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carathéodory 1909&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

''The Second Law of Thermodynamics'', Dowden, Hutchinson &amp; Ross, Stroudsburg PA.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be viewed as a re-statement of the principle stated by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] in the words: &quot;All heat is of the same kind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J.C.]] (1871). ''Theory of Heat'', Longmans, Green, and Co., London, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; This physical idea is also expressed by Bailyn as a possible version of the zeroth law of thermodynamics: &quot;All diathermal walls are equivalent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics Press, New York, ISBN 0-88318-797-3, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the present definition of thermodynamic temperature rests on the zeroth law of thermodynamics. Explicitly, this present definition of thermodynamic temperature also rests on the first law of thermodynamics, for the determination of amounts of energy transferred as heat.

Implicitly for this definition, the second law of thermodynamics provides information that establishes the virtuous character of the temperature so defined. It provides that any working substance that complies with the requirement stated in this definition will lead to the same ratio of thermodynamic temperatures, which in this sense is universal, or absolute. The second law of thermodynamics also provides that the thermodynamic temperature defined in this way is positive, because this definition requires that the heat reservoirs not be in thermal equilibrium with one another, and the cycle can be imagined to operate only in one sense if net work is to be supplied to the work reservoir.

Numerical details are settled by making one of the heat reservoirs a cell at the triple point of water, which is defined to have an absolute temperature of 273.16 K.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, T.J. (1983). ''Temperature'', Academic Press, London, ISBN 0-12-569680-9, pp. 160–162.&lt;/ref&gt;  The zeroth law of thermodynamics allows this definition to be used to measure the absolute or thermodynamic temperature of an arbitrary body of interest, by making the other heat reservoir have the same temperature as the body of interest.

===Temperature as an intensive variable===
In thermodynamic terms, temperature is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive variable]] because it is equal to a [[differential coefficient]] of one [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive variable]] with respect to another, for a given body. It thus has the [[Dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of a [[ratio]] of two extensive variables. In thermodynamics, two bodies are often considered as connected by contact with a common wall, which has some specific permeability properties. Such specific permeability can be referred to a specific intensive variable. An example is a diathermic wall that is permeable only to heat; the intensive variable for this case is temperature. When the two bodies have been in contact for a very long time, and have settled to a permanent steady state, the relevant intensive variables are equal in the two bodies; for a diathermal wall, this statement is sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Tisza, L. (1966). ''Generalized Thermodynamics'', M.I.T. Press, Cambridge MA, pp. 47,57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Munster 49 69&quot;&gt;Münster, A. (1970), ''Classical Thermodynamics'', translated by E.S. Halberstadt, Wiley–Interscience, London, ISBN 0-471-62430-6, pp. 49, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailyn 14 214&quot;&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics Press, New York, ISBN 0-88318-797-3, pp. 14–15, 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature local when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails===
Real world bodies are often not in thermodynamic equilibrium and not homogeneous. For study by methods of classical irreversible thermodynamics, a body is usually spatially and temporally divided conceptually into 'cells' of small size. If classical thermodynamic equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation in such a 'cell', then it is homogeneous and a temperature exists for it. If this is so for every 'cell' of the body, then [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Local and global equilibrium|local thermodynamic equilibrium]] is said to prevail throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Arthur Milne|Milne, E.A.]] (1929). The effect of collisions on monochromatic radiative equilibrium, [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1928MNRAS..88..493M&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'', '''88''': 493–502].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gyarmati, I. (1970). ''Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics. Field Theory and Variational Principles'', translated by E. Gyarmati and W.F. Heinz, Springer, Berlin, pp. 63–66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glansdorff, P., [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]], (1971).

''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics Press, New York, ISBN 0-88318-797-3, pp. 133–135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), ''Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics'', (first edition 1960), second edition 1985, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, ISBN 0–471–86256–8, pp. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

It makes good sense, for example, to say of the extensive variable {{math|''U''}}, or of the extensive variable {{math|''S''}}, that it has a density per unit volume, or a quantity per unit mass of the system, but it makes no sense to speak of density of temperature per unit volume or quantity of temperature per unit mass of the system. On the other hand, it makes no sense to speak of the internal energy at a point, while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, it makes good sense to speak of the temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium.

Thus, when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails in a body, temperature can be regarded as a spatially varying local property in that body, and this is because temperature is an intensive variable.

==Kinetic theory approach to temperature==
A more thorough account of this is below at [[#Theoretical foundation|Theoretical foundation]].

[[Kinetic theory]] provides a microscopic explanation of temperature, based on macroscopic systems' being composed of many microscopic particles, such as [[molecule]]s and [[ion]]s of various species, the particles of a species being all alike. It explains macroscopic phenomena through the [[classical mechanics]] of the microscopic particles. The [[equipartition theorem]] of kinetic theory asserts that each classical [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] of a freely moving particle has an average kinetic energy of {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/2}} where {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} denotes [[Boltzmann's constant]]. The translational motion of the particle has three degrees of freedom, so that, except at very low temperatures where quantum effects predominate, the average translational kinetic energy of a freely moving particle in a system with temperature {{math|''T''}} will be {{math|3''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/2}}.

It is possible to measure the average kinetic energy of constituent microscopic particles if they are allowed to escape from the bulk of the system. The spectrum of velocities has to be measured, and the average calculated from that. It is not necessarily the case that the particles that escape and are measured have the same velocity distribution as the particles that remain in the bulk of the system, but sometimes a good sample is possible.

[[Molecule]]s, such as oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), have more [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] than single spherical atoms: they undergo rotational and vibrational motions as well as translations. Heating results in an increase in temperature due to an increase in the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules. Heating will also cause, through [[equipartition]]ing, the energy associated with vibrational and rotational modes to increase. Thus a [[diatomic]] gas will require more energy input to increase its temperature by a certain amount, i.e. it will have a greater [[heat capacity]] than a monatomic gas.

The process of cooling involves removing internal energy from a system. When no more energy can be removed, the system is at absolute zero, though this cannot be achieved experimentally. Absolute zero is the null point of the [[thermodynamic temperature]] scale, also called absolute temperature. If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all classical motion of its particles would cease and they would be at complete rest in this classical sense. Microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics, however, matter still has [[zero-point energy]] even at absolute zero, because of the [[uncertainty principle]].

==Basic theory==
Temperature is a measure of a [[Categories (Aristotle)#The Praedicamenta|quality]] of a state of a material&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, G.H. (1907). ''Thermodynamics. An Introductory Treatise dealing mainly with First Principles and their Direct Applications'', B.G. Teubner, Leipzig, page 3.[http://www.e-booksdirectory.com/details.php?ebook=6455]&lt;/ref&gt;  The quality may be regarded as a more abstract entity than any particular temperature scale that measures it, and is called ''hotness'' by some writers. The quality of hotness refers to the state of material only in a particular locality, and in general, apart from bodies held in a steady state of thermodynamic equilibrium, hotness varies from place to place. It is not necessarily the case that a material in a particular place is in a state that is steady and nearly homogeneous enough to allow it to have a well-defined hotness or temperature. Hotness may be represented abstractly as a one-dimensional manifold. Every valid temperature scale has its own one-to-one map into the hotness manifold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mach 1900&quot;&gt;Mach, E.

When two systems in thermal contact are at the same temperature no heat transfers between them.

Experimental physicists, for example [[Galileo Galilei#Technology|Galileo]] and [[Newtons law of cooling|Newton]],&lt;ref&gt;Tait, P.G. (1884). ''Heat'', Macmillan, London, Chapter VII, pages 42, 103-117.&lt;/ref&gt; found that there are indefinitely many [[Scale of temperature|empirical temperature scales]]. Nevertheless, the zeroth law of thermodynamics says that they all measure the same quality.

===Temperature for bodies in thermodynamic equilibrium===
For experimental physics, hotness means that, when comparing any two given bodies in their respective separate [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|thermodynamic equilibria]], any two suitably given empirical thermometers with numerical scale readings will agree as to which is the hotter of the two given bodies, or that they have the same temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, J.A., Oppenheim, I. (1979). ''Principles of Thermodynamics'', Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 0–444–41806–7, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not require the two thermometers to have a linear relation between their numerical scale readings, but it does require that the relation between their numerical readings shall be [[monotonic|strictly monotonic]].&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P.T. (1961). ''Thermodynamics with Quantum Statistical Illustrations'', Interscience Publishers, New York, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomsen | first1 = J.S. | year = 1962 | title = A restatement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics | url = | journal = Am.

Thermal radiation is initially defined for a cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium. These physical facts justify a mathematical statement that hotness exists on an ordered one-dimensional [[manifold]]. This is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truesdell 1980&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mach 1900&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Serrin 1986&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C.

Except for a system undergoing a [[order parameter|first-order]] [[phase transition|phase change]] such as the melting of ice, as a closed system receives heat, without change in its volume and without change in external force fields acting on it, its temperature rises. For a system undergoing such a phase change so slowly that departure from thermodynamic equilibrium can be neglected, its temperature remains constant as the system is supplied with [[latent heat]]. Conversely, a loss of heat from a closed system, without phase change, without change of volume, and without change in external force fields acting on it, decreases its temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C., Bharatha, S. (1977). ''The Concepts and Logic of Classical Thermodynamics as a Theory of Heat Engines, Rigorously Constructed upon the Foundation Laid by S. Carnot and F. Reech'', Springer, New York, ISBN 0-387-07971-8, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature for bodies in a steady state but not in thermodynamic equilibrium===
While for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium states, the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that they are at the same temperature, this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, and if this is so, then at least one of the bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]].

===Temperature for bodies not in a steady state===
When a body is not in a steady state, then the notion of temperature becomes even less safe than for a body in a steady state not in thermodynamic equilibrium. This is also a matter for study in [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]].

===Thermodynamic equilibrium axiomatics===
For axiomatic treatment of thermodynamic equilibrium, since the 1930s, it has become customary to refer to a [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]]. The customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies, which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium, should be said to have the same temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale. A more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a hotness manifold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mach 1900&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitteri 1984&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Serrin 1978&quot;&gt;Serrin, J.

Medeiros, North-Holland, Amsterdam, ISBN 0-444-85166-6, pages 411-451.&lt;/ref&gt; While the zeroth law permits the definitions of many different empirical scales of temperature, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] selects the definition of a single preferred, [[absolute temperature]], unique up to an arbitrary scale factor, whence called the [[thermodynamic temperature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Truesdell 1980&quot;&gt;Truesdell, C.A.

''Introduction to Modern Thermodynamics'', Wiley, Chichester, ISBN 978-0-470-01598-8, Section 32., pages 106-108.&lt;/ref&gt; If [[internal energy]] is considered as a function of the volume and entropy of a homogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium, thermodynamic absolute temperature appears as the partial derivative of [[internal energy]] with respect the [[entropy]] at constant volume. Its natural, intrinsic origin or null point is [[absolute zero]] at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum. Although this is the lowest absolute temperature described by the model, the [[third law of thermodynamics]] postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system.

==Heat capacity==
{{see also|Heat capacity|Calorimetry}}
When an energy transfer to or from a body is only as heat, state of the body changes. Depending on the surroundings and the walls separating them from the body, various changes are possible in the body. They include chemical reactions, increase of pressure, increase of temperature, and phase change. For each kind of change under specified conditions, the heat capacity is the ratio of the quantity of heat transferred to the magnitude of the change. For example, if the change is an increase in temperature at constant volume, with no phase change and no chemical change, then the temperature of the body rises and its pressure increases. The quantity of heat transferred, {{math|Δ''Q''}}, divided by the observed temperature change, {{math|Δ''T''}}, is the body's [[heat capacity]] at constant volume, {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.
: &lt;math&gt; C_V = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T} &lt;/math&gt;
If heat capacity is measured for a well defined [[amount of substance]], the [[specific heat]] is the measure of the heat required to increase the temperature of such a unit quantity by one unit of temperature. For example, to raise the temperature of water by one kelvin (equal to one degree Celsius) requires 4186 [[joules]] per [[kilogram]] (J/kg)..

==Temperature measurement==
[[File:Pakkanen.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Celsius thermometer measures a winter day temperature of {{gaps|-17|°C}}.]]
{{See also|Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|International Temperature Scale of 1990|Comparison of temperature scales}}
[[Temperature measurement]] using modern scientific [[thermometer]]s and temperature scales goes back at least as far as the early 18th century, when [[Gabriel Fahrenheit]] adapted a thermometer (switching to [[mercury (element)|mercury]]) and a scale both developed by [[Ole Rømer|Ole Christensen Rømer]]. Fahrenheit's scale is still in use in the United States for non-scientific applications.

Temperature is measured with [[thermometers]] that may be [[calibration|calibrated]] to a variety of [[Temperature conversion formulas|temperature scales]]. In most of the world (except for [[Belize]], [[Myanmar]], [[Liberia]] and the [[United States]]), the Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. Most scientists measure temperature using the Celsius scale and thermodynamic temperature using the [[Kelvin]] scale, which is the Celsius scale offset so that its null point is {{gaps|0|K}} = {{gaps|−273.15|°C}}, or [[absolute zero]]. Many engineering fields in the U.S., notably high-tech and US federal specifications (civil and military), also use the Kelvin and Celsius scales. Other engineering fields in the U.S. also rely upon the [[Rankine scale]] (a shifted Fahrenheit scale) when working in thermodynamic-related disciplines such as [[combustion]].

===Units===
The basic unit of temperature in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the [[kelvin]]. It has the symbol K.

For everyday applications, it is often convenient to use the Celsius scale, in which {{gaps|0|°C}} corresponds very closely to the [[freezing point]] of water and {{gaps|100|°C}} is its [[boiling point]] at sea level. Because liquid droplets commonly exist in clouds at sub-zero temperatures, {{gaps|0|°C}} is better defined as the melting point of ice. In this scale a temperature difference of 1 degree Celsius is the same as a {{gaps|1|kelvin}} increment, but the scale is offset by the temperature at which ice melts (273.15 K).

By international agreement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html The kelvin in the SI Brochure]&lt;/ref&gt; the Kelvin and Celsius scales are defined by two fixing points: [[absolute zero]] and the [[triple point]] of [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], which is water specially prepared with a specified blend of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. Absolute zero is defined as precisely {{gaps|0|K}} and {{gaps|−273.15|°C}}. It is the temperature at which all classical translational motion of the particles comprising matter ceases and they are at complete rest in the classical model. Quantum-mechanically, however, zero-point motion remains and has an associated energy, the [[zero-point energy]].  Matter is in its [[ground state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.calphad.com/absolute_zero.html
|title=Absolute Zero
|publisher=Calphad.com
|accessdate=2010-09-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contains no [[thermal energy]]. The triple point of water is defined as {{gaps|273.16|K}} and {{gaps|0.01|°C}}. This definition serves the following purposes: it fixes the magnitude of the kelvin as being precisely 1 part in 273.16 parts of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water; it establishes that one kelvin has precisely the same magnitude as one degree on the Celsius scale; and it establishes the difference between the null points of these scales as being {{gaps|273.15|K}} ({{gaps|0|K}} = {{gaps|−273.15|°C}} and {{gaps|273.16|K}} = {{gaps|0.01|°C}}).

In the United States, the Fahrenheit scale is widely used. On this scale the freezing point of water corresponds to 32&amp;nbsp;°F and the boiling point to 212&amp;nbsp;°F. The Rankine scale, still used in fields of chemical engineering in the U.S., is an absolute scale based on the Fahrenheit increment.

====Conversion====
The following table shows the [[temperature conversion formulas]] for conversions to and from the Celsius scale.
{{temperature|C}}

====Plasma physics====
The field of [[plasma physics]] deals with phenomena of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] nature that involve very high temperatures. It is customary to express temperature as energy in units of [[electronvolt]]s (eV) or kiloelectronvolts (keV). The energy, which has a different [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] from temperature, is then calculated as the product of the [[Boltzmann constant]] and temperature, &lt;math&gt; E = k_B T&lt;/math&gt;. Then, 1 eV corresponds to {{gaps|11|605|K}}. In the study of [[QCD matter]] one routinely encounters temperatures of the order of a few hundred [[MeV]], equivalent to about {{gaps|10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;|K}}.

==Theoretical foundation==
{{see also|Thermodynamic temperature}}
Historically, there are several scientific approaches to the explanation of temperature: the classical thermodynamic description based on macroscopic empirical variables that can be measured in a laboratory; the [[kinetic theory of gases]] which relates the macroscopic description to the probability distribution of the energy of motion of gas particles; and a microscopic explanation based on [[statistical physics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. In addition, rigorous and purely mathematical treatments have provided an axiomatic approach to classical thermodynamics and temperature.&lt;ref name=caratheodory&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical physics provides a deeper understanding by describing the atomic behavior of matter, and derives macroscopic properties from statistical averages of microscopic states, including both classical and quantum states. In the fundamental physical description, using [[natural units]], temperature may be measured directly in units of energy. However, in the practical systems of measurement for science, technology, and commerce, such as the modern [[metric system]] of units, the macroscopic and the microscopic descriptions are interrelated by the [[Boltzmann constant]], a proportionality factor that scales temperature to the microscopic mean kinetic energy.

The microscopic description in [[statistical mechanics]] is based on a model that analyzes a system into its fundamental particles of matter or into a set of classical or [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] oscillators and considers the system as a [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]] of [[State of matter|microstates]]. As a collection of classical material particles, temperature is a measure of the mean energy of motion, called [[kinetic energy]], of the particles, whether in solids, liquids, gases, or plasmas. The kinetic energy, a concept of [[classical mechanics]], is half the [[mass]] of a particle times its [[speed]] squared. In this mechanical interpretation of thermal motion, the kinetic energies of material particles may reside in the velocity of the particles of their translational or vibrational motion or in the inertia of their rotational modes. In monatomic [[perfect gas]]es and, approximately, in most gases, temperature is a measure of the mean particle kinetic energy. It also determines the probability distribution function of the energy. In condensed matter, and particularly in solids, this purely mechanical description is often less useful and the oscillator model provides a better description to account for quantum mechanical phenomena. Temperature determines the statistical occupation of the microstates of the ensemble. The microscopic definition of temperature is only meaningful in the [[thermodynamic limit]], meaning for large ensembles of states or particles, to fulfill the requirements of the statistical model.

In the context of thermodynamics, the kinetic energy is also referred to as [[thermal energy]]. The thermal energy may be partitioned into independent components attributed to the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the particles or to the modes of oscillators in a [[thermodynamic system]]. In general, the number of these degrees of freedom that are available for the [[equipartition theorem|equipartitioning]] of energy depend on the temperature, i.e. the energy region of the interactions under consideration. For solids, the thermal energy is associated primarily with the [[Atom vibrations|vibrations]] of its atoms or molecules about their equilibrium position. In an [[ideal gas|ideal monatomic gas]], the kinetic energy is found exclusively in the purely translational motions of the particles. In other systems, [[vibration]]al and [[rotation]]al motions also contribute degrees of freedom.

===Kinetic theory of gases===
[[File:Translational motion.gif|thumb|right|500px|A theoretical understanding of temperature in an ideal gas can be obtained from the [[Kinetic theory]].]]
[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] developed a [[kinetic theory]] that yields a fundamental understanding of temperature in gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swendsen|first=Robert|title=Statistical mechanics of colloids and Boltzmann's definition of entropy|journal=American Journal of Physucs|date=March 2006|volume=74|issue=3|pages=187–190|doi=10.1119/1.2174962|bibcode = 2006AmJPh..74..187S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gas thermometer and absolute zero.jpg|thumb|Plots of pressure vs temperature for three different gas samples extrapolated to absolute zero.]]
The [[ideal gas law]] is based on observed [[empirical relationship]]s between pressure (''p''), volume (''V''), and temperature (''T''), and was recognized long before the kinetic theory of gases was developed (see [[Boyle's law|Boyle's]] and [[Charles's law|Charles's]] laws).  The ideal gas law states:&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman]], R.P., Leighton, R.B., Sands, M. (1963). ''The Feynman Lectures on Physics'', Addison–Wesley, Reading MA, volume 1, pages 39–6 to 39–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;pV = nRT\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' is the number of [[mole unit|moles]] of gas and {{physconst|R|symbol=yes}}  is the [[gas constant]].

This relationship gives us our first hint that there is an [[absolute zero]] on the temperature scale, because it only holds if the temperature is measured on an [[absolute temperature|absolute]] scale such as Kelvins. The [[ideal gas law]] allows one to measure temperature on this [[absolute temperature|absolute]] scale using the [[gas thermometer]].  The temperature in kelvins can be defined as the pressure in pascals of one mole of gas in a container of one cubic meter, divided by the gas constant.

Although it is not a particularly convenient device, the [[gas thermometer]] provides an essential theoretical basis by which all thermometers can be calibrated.  As a practical matter it is not possible to use a gas thermometer to measure absolute zero temperature since the gases tend to condense into a liquid long before the temperature reaches zero. It is possible, however, to extrapolate to absolute zero by using the ideal gas law, as shown in the figure.

The kinetic theory assumes that pressure is caused by the force associated with individual atoms striking the walls, and that all energy is translational [[kinetic energy]].  Using a sophisticated symmetry argument,&lt;ref&gt;http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/kinetic_theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] deduced what is now called the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell–Boltzmann probability distribution]] function for the velocity of particles in an ideal gas.  From that [[probability distribution]] function, the average [[kinetic energy]], ''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' (per particle), of a [[monatomic]] [[ideal gas]] is:&lt;ref name=&quot;K&amp;K 391 397&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolman, R.C. (1938). ''The Principles of Statistical Mechanics'', Oxford University Press, London, pp. 93, 655.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} =  \frac 1 2 mv_\mathrm{rms}^2 = \frac 3 2  k T\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Boltzmann constant]], {{var|k}}, is the [[ideal gas constant]] divided by the [[Avogadro number]], and ''v&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[root-mean-square speed]]. Thus the ideal gas law states that [[internal energy]] is directly proportional to temperature.&lt;ref name=atkins&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This direct proportionality between temperature and [[internal energy]] is a special case of the [[Equipartition theorem#General formulation of the equipartition theorem|equipartition theorem]], and holds only in the [[classical physics|classical]] limit of an [[ideal gas]]. It does not hold for most substances, although it is true that temperature is a [[monotonic function|monotonic]] (non-decreasing) function of [[internal energy]].

===Zeroth law of thermodynamics===
{{main|Zeroth law of thermodynamics}}

When two otherwise isolated bodies are connected together by a rigid physical path impermeable to matter, there is spontaneous transfer of energy as heat from the hotter to the colder of them. Eventually they reach a state of mutual [[thermal equilibrium]], in which heat transfer has ceased, and the bodies' respective state variables have settled to become unchanging.

One statement of the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]] is that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

This statement helps to define temperature but it does not, by itself, complete the definition. An empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the hotness of a thermodynamic system. Such hotness may be defined as existing on a [[Manifold#Motivational examples|one-dimensional manifold]], stretching between hot and cold. Sometimes the zeroth law is stated to include the existence of a unique universal hotness manifold, and of numerical scales on it, so as to provide a complete definition of empirical temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serrin 1978&quot;/&gt; To be suitable for empirical thermometry, a material must have a monontonic relation between hotness and some easily measured state variable, such as pressure or volume, when all other relevant coordinates are fixed. An exceptionally suitable system is the [[ideal gas]], which can provide a temperature scale that matches the absolute Kelvin scale. The Kelvin scale is defined on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics.

===Second law of thermodynamics===
{{main|Second law of thermodynamics}}
In the previous section certain properties of temperature were expressed by the zeroth law of thermodynamics. It is also possible to define temperature in terms of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] which deals with [[entropy]]. Entropy is often thought of as a measure of the disorder in a system. The second law states that any process will result in either no change or a net increase in the entropy of the universe. This can be understood in terms of probability.

For example, in a series of coin tosses, a perfectly ordered system would be one in which either every toss comes up heads or every toss comes up tails. This means that for a perfectly ordered set of coin tosses, there is only one set of toss outcomes possible: the set in which 100% of tosses come up the same. On the other hand, there are multiple combinations that can result in disordered or mixed systems, where some fraction are heads and the rest tails. A disordered system can be 90% heads and 10% tails, or it could be 98% heads and 2% tails, et cetera. As the number of coin tosses increases, the number of possible combinations corresponding to imperfectly ordered systems increases. For a very large number of coin tosses, the combinations to ~50% heads and ~50% tails dominates and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 50/50 becomes extremely unlikely. Thus the system naturally progresses to a state of maximum disorder or entropy.

It has been previously stated that temperature governs the transfer of heat between two systems and it was just shown that the universe tends to progress so as to maximize entropy, which is expected of any natural system. Thus, it is expected that there is some relationship between temperature and entropy. To find this relationship, the relationship between heat, work and temperature is first considered. A [[heat engine]] is a device for converting thermal energy into mechanical energy, resulting in the performance of work, and analysis of the [[Carnot heat engine]] provides the necessary relationships. The work from a heat engine corresponds to the difference between the heat put into the system at the high temperature, ''q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the heat ejected at the low temperature, ''q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''. The efficiency is the work divided by the heat put into the system or:
:&lt;math&gt;
\textrm{efficiency} = \frac {w_{cy}}{q_H} = \frac{q_H-q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \frac{q_C}{q_H} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(4)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w&lt;sub&gt;cy&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the work done per cycle. The efficiency depends only on ''q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''/''q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;''. Because ''q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' correspond to heat transfer at the temperatures ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'', respectively, ''q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''/''q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' should be some function of these temperatures:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(5)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]] states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Thus, a heat engine operating between ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the second between ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This can only be the case if:
:&lt;math&gt;
q_{13} = \frac{q_1 q_2} {q_2 q_3}
&lt;/math&gt;

which implies:
:&lt;math&gt;
q_{13} = f(T_1,T_3) = f(T_1,T_2)f(T_2,T_3)
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the first function is independent of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, this temperature must cancel on the right side, meaning ''f''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is of the form ''g''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/''g''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (i.e. ''f''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''f''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''g''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/''g''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)· ''g''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/''g''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''g''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/''g''(''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)), where ''g'' is a function of a single temperature. A temperature scale can now be chosen with the property that:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{q_C}{q_H} = \frac{T_C}{T_H}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(6)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting Equation 4 back into Equation 2 gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature:
:&lt;math&gt;
\textrm{efficiency} = 1 - \frac{q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(7)
&lt;/math&gt;

For ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0 K the efficiency is 100% and that efficiency becomes greater than 100% below 0 K. Since an efficiency greater than 100% violates the first law of thermodynamics, this implies that 0 K is the minimum possible temperature. In fact the lowest temperature ever obtained in a macroscopic system was 20 nK, which was achieved in 1995 at NIST. Subtracting the right hand side of Equation 5 from the middle portion and rearranging gives:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {q_H}{T_H} - \frac{q_C}{T_C} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where the negative sign indicates heat ejected from the system. This relationship suggests the existence of a state function, ''S'', defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;
dS = \frac {dq_\mathrm{rev}}{T}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(8)&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript indicates a reversible process. The change of this state function around any cycle is zero, as is necessary for any state function.  This function corresponds to the entropy of the system, which was described previously. Rearranging Equation 6 gives a new definition for temperature in terms of entropy and heat:
:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{dq_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(9)&lt;/math&gt;

For a system, where entropy ''S''(''E'') is a function of its energy ''E'', the temperature ''T'' is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
{T}^{-1} = \frac{d}{dE} S(E)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(10)&lt;/math&gt;,

i.e. the reciprocal of the temperature is the rate of increase of entropy with respect to energy.

===Definition from statistical mechanics===
[[Statistical mechanics]] defines temperature based on a system's fundamental degrees of freedom.  Eq.(10) is the defining relation of temperature. Eq. (9) can be derived from the principles underlying the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]].

===Generalized temperature from single particle statistics===
It is possible to extend the definition of temperature even to systems of few particles, like in a [[quantum dot]]. The generalized temperature is obtained by considering time ensembles instead of configuration space ensembles given in statistical mechanics in the case of thermal and particle exchange between a small system of [[fermion]]s (N even less than 10) with a single/double occupancy system.

&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''  is the [[Fermi energy]] which tends to the ordinary temperature when N goes to infinity.

===Negative temperature===
{{main|Negative temperature}}
On the empirical temperature scales, which are not referenced to absolute zero, a negative temperature is one below the zero-point of the scale used. For example, [[dry ice]] has a sublimation temperature of {{gaps|−78.5|°C}} which is equivalent to {{gaps|−109.3|°F}}. On the absolute Kelvin scale, however, this temperature is 194.6 K. On the absolute scale of thermodynamic temperature no material can have a temperature smaller than or equal to 0 K, both of which are forbidden by the [[third law of thermodynamics]].

Temperature is basically defined for a body in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and in this definition, on an absolute scale, it is always positive. In an apparent contradiction of this reliable and valid rule, a so-called negative absolute &quot;temperature&quot; may be approximately defined for a component of a body that is not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium: a component may have a negative approximate &quot;temperature&quot; while the rest of the components of the body have positive approximate temperatures. Such a non-equilibrium situation is either transient in time or is maintained by external factors that drive a flow of energy through the body of interest. An example of such a component is a spin system within a body, as follows.

In the quantum mechanical description of electron and nuclear spin systems that have a limited number of possible states, and therefore a discrete upper limit of energy they can attain, it is possible to obtain a [[negative temperature]], which is numerically indeed less than absolute zero. However, this is not the macroscopic temperature of the material, but instead the temperature of only very specific degrees of freedom, that are isolated from others and do not exchange energy by virtue of the [[equipartition theorem]].

A negative temperature is experimentally achieved with suitable radio frequency techniques that cause a [[population inversion]] of spin states from the ground state. As the energy in the system increases upon population of the upper states, the entropy increases as well, as the system becomes less ordered, but attains a maximum value when the spins are evenly distributed among ground and excited states, after which it begins to decrease, once again achieving a state of higher order as the upper states begin to fill exclusively. At the point of maximum entropy, the temperature function shows the behavior of a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]], because the slope of the entropy function decreases to zero at first and then turns negative. Since temperature is the inverse of the derivative of the entropy, the temperature formally goes to infinity at this point, and switches to negative infinity as the slope turns negative. At energies higher than this point, the spin degree of freedom therefore exhibits formally a negative thermodynamic temperature. As the energy increases further by continued population of the excited state, the negative temperature approaches zero asymptotically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the energy of the system increases in the population inversion, a system with a negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero, but rather it has a higher energy than at positive temperature, and may be said to be in fact hotter at negative temperatures. When brought into contact with a system at a positive temperature, energy will be transferred from the negative temperature regime to the positive temperature region.

The neutron stars in the model were 1.2 and 1.6 solar masses respectively, were roughly 20&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, and were orbiting around their barycenter (common center of mass) at about 390&amp;nbsp;Hz during the last several milliseconds before they completely merged. The 350&amp;nbsp;GK portion was a small volume located at the pair's developing common core and varied from roughly 1 to 7&amp;nbsp;km across over a time span of around 5&amp;nbsp;ms. Imagine two city-sized objects of unimaginable density orbiting each other at the same frequency as the G4 musical note (the 28th white key on a piano). It's also noteworthy that at 350 GK, the average neutron has a vibrational speed of 30% the speed of light and a relativistic mass (''m'') 5% greater than its rest mass (''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).&amp;nbsp; [http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0507099.pdf ''Torus Formation in Neutron Star Mergers and Well-Localized Short Gamma-Ray Bursts''], R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">In [[radiometry]], '''radiant exitance''' is the [[radiant flux]] ''emitted'' by a ''surface'' per unit area, and '''spectral exitance''' is the radiant exitance of a ''surface'' per unit [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]], depending on whether the [[Spectral radiometric quantity|spectrum]] is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. This is the emitted component of [[radiosity (heat transfer)|radiosity]]. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of radiant exitance is the [[watt]] per square metre ({{nobreak|W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), while that of spectral exitance in frequency is the watt per square metre per [[hertz]] (W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and that of spectral exitance in wavelength is the watt per square metre per metre (W·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;)—commonly the watt per square metre per nanometre ({{nobreak|W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·nm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}). The [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS unit]] [[erg]] per square centimeter per second ({{nobreak|erg·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is often used in [[astronomy]]. &quot;Radiant emittance&quot; is an old term for this quantity. Radiant exitance is often called &quot;intensity&quot; in branches of physics other than radiometry, but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with [[radiant intensity]].

==Mathematical definitions==
===Radiant exitance===
'''Radiant exitance''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''M''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with [[photometry (optics)|photometric]] quantities), is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16943|title=Thermal insulation — Heat transfer by radiation — Physical quantities and definitions|work=ISO 9288:1989|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] catalogue|year=1989|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{e} = \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial A},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*∂ is the [[partial derivative]] symbol;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[radiant flux]] ''emitted'';
*''A'' is the area.

If we want to talk about the radiant flux ''received'' by a surface, we speak of [[irradiance]].

The radiance exitance of a [[Black body|black surface]], according to the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{e}^\circ = \sigma T^4,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*σ is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]];
*''T'' is the temperature of that surface,
so for a real surface, the radiant exitance is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{e} = \varepsilon M_\mathrm{e}^\circ = \varepsilon \sigma T^4,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ε'' is the [[emissivity]] of that surface.

===Spectral exitance===
'''Spectral exitance in frequency''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''M''&lt;sub&gt;e,ν&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{\mathrm{e},\nu} = \frac{\partial M_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \nu},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ν'' is the frequency.

'''Spectral exitance in wavelength''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''M''&lt;sub&gt;e,λ&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = \frac{\partial M_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' is the wavelength.

The spectral exitance of a [[Black body|black surface]] around a given frequency or wavelength, according to the [[Lambert's cosine law]] and the [[Planck's law]], is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;M_{\mathrm{e},\nu}^\circ = \pi L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega,\nu}^\circ = \frac{2\pi \mathrm{h}\nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^\frac{\mathrm{h}\nu}{\mathrm{k}T} - 1},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}^\circ = \pi L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega,\lambda}^\circ = \frac{2\pi \mathrm{h}c^2}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^\frac{\mathrm{h}c}{\lambda\mathrm{k}T} - 1},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*h is the [[Planck constant]];
*''ν'' is the frequency;
*''λ'' is the wavelength;
*k is the [[Boltzmann constant]];
*''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in the medium;
*''T'' is the temperature of that surface,
so for a real surface, the spectral exitance is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;M_{\mathrm{e},\nu} = \varepsilon M_{\mathrm{e},\nu}^\circ = \frac{2\pi \mathrm{h}\varepsilon \nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^\frac{\mathrm{h}\nu}{\mathrm{k}T} - 1},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = \varepsilon M_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}^\circ = \frac{2\pi \mathrm{h}\varepsilon c^2}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^\frac{\mathrm{h}c}{\lambda\mathrm{k}T} - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[physics]], '''moment''' is a combination of a physical quantity and a distance.  Moments are usually defined with respect to a fixed reference point or axis; they deal with physical quantities as measured at some distance from that reference point or axis.  For example, a moment of force is the product of a force and its distance from an axis, which causes rotation about that axis.  In principle, any physical quantity can be combined with a distance to produce a moment; commonly used quantities include forces, masses, and electric charge distributions.

== Elaboration ==
In its most simple and basic form, a moment is the product of the distance to some point, raised to some power, multiplied by some physical quantity such as the force, charge, etc. at that point:

: &lt;math&gt;\mu_n =  r^n\,Q&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the physical quantity such as a force applied at a point, or a point charge, or a point mass, etc. If the quantity is not concentrated solely at a single point, the moment is the integral of that quantity's density over space:

: &lt;math&gt;\mu_n=\int r^n\,\rho(r)\,dr&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the distribution of the density of charge, mass, or whatever quantity is being considered.

More complex forms take into account the angular relationships between the distance and the physical quantity, but the above equations capture the essential feature of a moment, namely the existence of an underlying &lt;math&gt;r^n\,\rho(r)&lt;/math&gt; or equivalent term.  This implies that there are multiple moments (one for each value of ''n'') and that the moment generally depends on the reference point from which the distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is measured, although for certain moments (technically, the lowest non-zero moment) this dependence vanishes and the moment becomes independent of the reference point.

Each value of ''n'' corresponds to a different moment: the 1st moment corresponds to ''n=1''; the 2nd moment to ''n=2'', etc.  The 0th moment (''n=0'') is sometimes called the ''monopole moment''; the 1st moment (''n=1'') is sometimes called the ''dipole moment'', and the 2nd moment (''n=2'') is sometimes called the ''[[quadrupole moment]]'', especially in the context of electric charge distributions.

=== Examples ===
* The ''moment of force'', or ''[[torque]]'', is a 1st moment: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau} = rF&lt;/math&gt;, or, more generally, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;
* The ''[[electric dipole moment]]'' is also a 1st moment: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = q\,\mathbf{d}&lt;/math&gt; for two opposite point charges or &lt;math&gt;\int \mathbf{r}\,\rho(\mathbf{r})\,d^3r&lt;/math&gt; for a distributed charge with charge density &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; 
* The ''[[moment of inertia]]'' is a 2nd moment: &lt;math&gt;I = r^2 m&lt;/math&gt; for a point mass, &lt;math&gt;\sum_i r_i^2 m_i&lt;/math&gt; for a collection of point masses, or &lt;math&gt; \int r^2\rho(\mathbf{r}) \, d^3r&lt;/math&gt; for an object with mass distribution &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

== Multiple moments ==
Assuming a density function that is finite and localized to a particular region, outside that region a ''1/r'' [[Scalar potential|potential]] may be expressed as a series of [[spherical harmonics]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi(\mathbf{r}) = 
\int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r'})}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|}d^3r' =
\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}
\sum_{m=-l}^{l} 
\left( \frac{4\pi}{2l+1} \right)
q_{lm}\,
\frac{Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)}{r^{l+1}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients &lt;math&gt;q_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; are known as ''multipole moments'', and take the form:
:&lt;math&gt;
q_{lm} = \int 
(r')^{l}\,
\rho(\mathbf{r'})\,
Y^*_{lm}(\theta',\phi')\,
d^3r'
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}'&lt;/math&gt; expressed in spherical coordinates
&lt;math&gt;(r',\phi',\theta')&lt;/math&gt; is a variable of integration.  A more complete
treatment may be found in pages describing [[multipole expansion]] or
[[spherical multipole moments]].  (Note: the convention in the above equations 
was taken from Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Jackson, ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd
edition, Wiley, New York, (1975). p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;  The conventions used in the
referenced pages may be slightly different.)  

When &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; represents an electric charge density, the &lt;math&gt;q_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; are, in a sense, projections of the moments of electric charge: &lt;math&gt;q_{00}&lt;/math&gt; is the monopole moment; the &lt;math&gt;q_{1m}&lt;/math&gt; are projections of the dipole moment, the &lt;math&gt;q_{2m}&lt;/math&gt; are projections of the quadrupole moment, etc.

== Applications of multipole moments ==
The multipole expansion applies to ''1/r'' scalar potentials, examples of which include the  [[electric potential]] and the [[gravitational potential]].  For these potentials, the expression can be used to approximate the strength of a field produced by a localized distribution of charges (or mass) by calculating the first few moments.  For sufficiently large ''r'', a reasonable approximation can be obtained from just the monopole and dipole moments.  Higher fidelity can be achieved by calculating higher order moments. Extensions of the technique can be used to [[Spherical_multipole_moments#Interaction_energies_of_spherical_multipoles|calculate interaction energies]] and intermolecular forces.

The technique can also be used to determine the properties of an unknown distribution &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.  Measurements pertaining to multipole moments may be taken and used to infer properties of the underlying distribution.  This technique applies to small objects such as molecules,&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of moment in physics is derived from the mathematical concept of [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, D.G.E.; Caldwell, G.E.; Hamill, J.; Kamen, G.; and Whittlesey, S.N. (2004) Research Methods in Biomechanics. Champaign, IL:Human Kinetics Publ., p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{clarify|date=May 2014}}. The principle of moments is derived from Archimedes' discovery of the operating principle of the lever. In the lever one applies a force, in his day most often human muscle, to an arm, a beam of some sort. Archimedes noted that the amount of force applied to the object, the moment of force, is defined as M = rF, where F is the applied force, and r is the distance from the applied force to object. However, historical evolution of the term 'moment' and its use in different branches of science, such as mathematics, physics and engineering, is unclear.

[[Federico Commandino]], in 1565, translated into Latin from [[Archimedes]]:
:''The center of gravity of each solid figure is that point within it, about which on all sides parts of equal moment stand.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|last=Commandini
|first=Federici
|title=Liber de Centro Gravitatis Solidorum
|date=1565}}, (at [https://books.google.com/books Google books])&lt;/ref&gt;
This was apparently the first use of the word ''moment'' (Latin, ''momentorum'') in the sense which we now know it: a moment about a center of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:''The word'' moment ''was first used in Mechanics in its now rather old-fashioned sense of 'importance' or 'consequence,' and the moment of a force about an axis meant the importance of the force with respect to its power to generate in matter rotation about the axis... But the word 'moment' has also come to be used by analogy in a purely technical sense, in such expressions as the 'moment of a mass about an axis,' or 'the moment of an area with respect to a plane,' which require definition in each case. In those instances there is not always any corresponding physical idea, and such phrases stand, both historically and scientifically, on a different footing.'' - A. M.

'''Electrical measurements''' are the methods, devices and calculations used to measure electrical quantities. Measurement of electrical quantities may be done to measure electrical parameters of a system. Using [[List of sensors|transducers]], physical properties such as temperature, pressure, flow, force, and many others can be converted into electrical signals, which can then be conveniently measured and recorded. High-precision laboratory measurements of electrical quantities are used in experiments to determine fundamental physical properties such as the charge of the [[electron]] or the [[speed of light]], and in the definition of the units for electrical measurements, with precision in some cases on the order of a few parts per million. Less precise measurements are required every day in industrial practice. Electrical measurements are a branch of the science of [[metrology]]. 
 
Measurable independent and semi-independent electrical quantities comprise:
* [[Voltage]]
* [[Electric current]] 
* [[Electrical resistance]] and [[electrical conductance]] 
* [[Electrical reactance]] and [[susceptance]]
* [[Magnetic flux]]
* [[Electrical charge]] by the means of [[electrometer]]
* [[Magnetic field]] by the means of [[Hall sensor]]
* [[Electric field]]
* [[Electrical power]] by the means of [[electricity meter]]
* [[S-matrix]] by the means of [[network analyzer (electrical)]]
* Electrical [[power spectrum]] by the means of [[spectrum analyzer]]

Measurable dependent electrical quantities comprise:
* [[Inductance]] 
* [[Capacitance]] 
* [[Electrical impedance]] defined as [[vector sum]] of [[electrical resistance]] and [[electrical reactance]]
* [[Admittance|Electrical admittance]], the reciprocal of electrical impedance
* Phase between current and voltage and related [[power factor]]
* Electrical [[spectral density]]
* Electrical [[phase noise]]
* Electrical amplitude noise
* [[Transconductance]]
* [[Transimpedance]]
* Electrical [[power gain]]
* [[Voltage gain]]
* [[Current gain]]
* [[Frequency]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43160">In [[heat transfer]], the '''[[thermal conductivity]]''' of a substance, k, is an [[intensive property]] that indicates its ability to conduct [[heat]].

[[Thermal conductivity]] is often measured with [[Laser Flash Analysis|laser flash analysis]]. Alternative [[Thermal conductivity measurement|ments]] are also established.

Mixtures may have variable thermal conductivities due to composition.

Note that this table shows thermal conductivity in units of watts per metre per Kelvin (W·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).  This is the current metric unit of measurement.  Prior to this, however, thermal conductivity was measured in terms of [[BTU]]s per foot per hour per degree Fahrenheit.  A value for the former can be computed from the latter by multiplying by 1.728.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|author=Roger N.

{{Sound measurements}}
'''Sound intensity''' also known as '''acoustic intensity''' is defined as the [[sound power]] per unit area. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of sound intensity is the [[watt]] per square metre (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The usual context is the noise measurement of sound [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] in the air at a listener's location as a sound energy quantity.&lt;ref name=“GeorgiaStateUniversity&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sound Intensity|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/intens.html|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sound intensity is not the same physical quantity as [[sound pressure]]. Hearing is directly sensitive to sound pressure which is related to sound intensity. In consumer audio electronics, the level differences are called &quot;intensity&quot; differences, but sound intensity is a specifically defined quantity and cannot be sensed by a simple microphone.
Sound energy passing per second through a unit area held perpendicular to the direction of propagation of sound waves is called intensity of sound.

==Mathematical definition==
Sound intensity, denoted '''I''', is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf I = p \mathbf v&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''p'' is the [[sound pressure]];
*'''v''' is the [[particle velocity]].

Both '''I''' and '''v''' are [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]], which means that both have a ''direction'' as well as a magnitude. The direction of sound intensity is the average direction in which energy is flowing.

The average sound intensity during time ''T'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf I\rangle = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T p(t) \mathbf v(t)\,\mathrm{d}t.&lt;/math&gt;

==Inverse-square law==
{{See|Inverse-square law}}
For a ''spherical'' sound wave, the intensity in the radial direction as a function of distance ''r'' from the centre of the sphere is given by
:&lt;math&gt;I(r) =  \frac{P}{A(r)} = \frac{P}{4 \pi r^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''P'' is the sound power;
*''A''(''r'') is the area of a sphere of radius ''r''.

Thus sound intensity decreases as 1/''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from the centre of the sphere:
:&lt;math&gt;I(r) \propto \frac{1}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship is an ''inverse-square law''.

==Sound intensity level==
{{Other uses|Sound level (disambiguation){{!}}Sound level}}
'''Sound intensity level''' (SIL) or '''acoustic intensity level''' is a [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|logarithmic measure]] of the sound intensity of a sound relative to a reference value.&lt;br&gt;
Sound intensity level, denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; and measured in [[Decibel|dB]], is defined by&lt;ref name=IEC60027-3&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/028981 &quot;Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology – Part 3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units&quot;], ''IEC 60027-3 Ed. 3.0'', International Electrotechnical Commission, 19 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_I = \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{Np} = \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{B} = 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''I'' is the sound intensity;
*''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''reference sound intensity'';
*{{no break|1=1 Np = 1}} is the [[neper]];
*{{no break|1=1 B = (1/2) ln(10)}} is the [[Decibel|bel]];
*{{no break|1=1 dB = (1/20) ln(10)}} is the [[decibel]].

The commonly used reference sound intensity in air is&lt;ref&gt;Ross Roeser, Michael Valente, ''Audiology: Diagnosis'' (Thieme 2007), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_0 = 1~\mathrm{pW/m^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The proper notations for sound intensity level using this reference are {{nobreak|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''I'' /(1 pW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{nobreak|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; (re 1 pW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, but the notations {{nobreak|dB SIL}}, {{nobreak|dB(SIL)}}, dBSIL, or dB&lt;sub&gt;SIL&lt;/sub&gt; are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI.&lt;ref name=NIST2008&gt;Thompson, A. and Taylor, B. N. sec 8.7, &quot;Logarithmic quantities and units: level, neper, bel&quot;, ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) 2008 Edition'', NIST Special Publication 811, 2nd printing (November 2008), SP811 [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference sound intensity ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined such that a progressive plane wave has the same value of sound intensity level (SIL) and [[sound pressure level]] (SPL), since
:&lt;math&gt;I \propto p^2.&lt;/math&gt;
The equality of SIL and SPL requires that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{I}{I_0} = \frac{p^2}{p_0^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{nobreak|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 20 μPa}} is the reference sound pressure.

For a ''progressive'' spherical wave,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{v} = z_0,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Acoustic impedance#Characteristic specific acoustic impedance|characteristic specific acoustic impedance]]. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;I_0 = \frac{p_0^2 I}{p^2} = \frac{p_0^2 pv}{p^2} = \frac{p_0^2}{z_0}.&lt;/math&gt;
In air at ambient temperature, {{nobreak|1=''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 410 Pa·s/m}}, hence the reference value {{nobreak|1=''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 pW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sound Power Measurements, Hewlett Packard Application Note 1230, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[anechoic chamber]], which approximates a free field (no reflection), the SIL can be taken as being equal to the SPL. This fact is exploited to measure sound power in anechoic conditions.

==Measurement==
One method of sound intensity measurement involves the use of two microphones located close to each other, normal to the direction of sound energy flow. A signal analyser is used to compute the crosspower between the measured pressures and the sound intensity is derived from (proportional to) the imaginary part of the crosspower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bksv.com/doc/TechnicalReview1982-3.pdf Sound Intensity (Theory)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sound measurements}}

'''Sound pressure''' or '''acoustic pressure''' is the local [[pressure]] deviation from the ambient (average, or equilibrium) [[atmospheric pressure]], caused by a [[sound wave]]. In air, sound pressure can be measured using a [[microphone]], and in water with a [[hydrophone]]. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of sound pressure is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa).&lt;ref name=“engineering toolbox&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sound Pressure is the force of sound on a surface area perpendicular to the direction of the sound|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/sound-pressure-d_711.html|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical definition==
[[File:Sound pressure diagram.svg|thumb|250px|Sound pressure diagram:&lt;br&gt;1. silence;&lt;br&gt;2. audible sound;&lt;br&gt;3. atmospheric pressure;&lt;br&gt;4. sound pressure]]

A sound wave in a [[transmission medium]] causes a deviation (sound pressure, a ''dynamic'' pressure) in the local ambient pressure, a ''static'' pressure.&lt;br&gt;
Sound pressure, denoted ''p'', is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{total} = p_\mathrm{stat} + p,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''p''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; is the total pressure;
*''p''&lt;sub&gt;stat&lt;/sub&gt; is the static pressure.

==Sound measurements==
===Sound intensity===
{{main|Sound intensity}}
In a sound wave, the complementary variable to sound pressure is the [[particle velocity]]. Together they determine the sound intensity of the wave.&lt;br&gt;
''Sound intensity'', denoted '''I''' and measured in [[Watt|W]]·[[Metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; in SI units, is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf I = p \mathbf v,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''p'' is the sound pressure;
*'''v''' is the particle velocity.

===Acoustic impedance===
{{main|Acoustic impedance}}
''Acoustic impedance'', denoted ''Z'' and measured in Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;·s in SI units, is defined by&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=J.|title=What is acoustic impedance and why is it important?|url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/z.html|publisher=University of New South Wales, Dept. of Physics, Music Acoustics|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z(s) = \frac{\hat{p}(s)}{\hat{Q}(s)},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;\hat{p}(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace transform]] of sound pressure{{fact|date=April 2015}};
*&lt;math&gt;\hat{Q}(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the Laplace transform of sound volume flow rate.

''Specific acoustic impedance'', denoted ''z'' and measured in Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·s in SI units, is defined by&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfe&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z(s) = \frac{\hat{p}(s)}{\hat{v}(s)},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;\hat{p}(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the Laplace transform of sound pressure;
*&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the Laplace transform of particle velocity.

===Particle displacement===
{{main|Particle displacement}}
The ''particle displacement'' of a ''progressive [[sine wave]]'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathbf{r},\, t) = \delta_\mathrm{m} \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{\delta, 0}),&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[amplitude]] of the particle displacement;
*&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\delta, 0}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase shift]] of the particle displacement;
*'''k''' is the [[angular wavevector]];
*''ω'' is the [[angular frequency]].

It follows that the particle velocity and the sound pressure along the direction of propagation of the sound wave ''x'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt;v(\mathbf{r},\, t) = \frac{\partial \delta}{\partial t} (\mathbf{r},\, t) = \omega \delta_\mathrm{m} \cos\!\left(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{\delta, 0} + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = v_\mathrm{m} \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{v, 0}),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(\mathbf{r},\, t) = -\rho c^2 \frac{\partial \delta}{\partial x} (\mathbf{r},\, t) = \rho c^2 k_x \delta_\mathrm{m} \cos\!\left(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{\delta, 0} + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = p_\mathrm{m} \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{p, 0}),&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''v''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the amplitude of the particle velocity;
*&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{v, 0}&lt;/math&gt; is the phase shift of the particle velocity;
*''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the amplitude of the acoustic pressure;
*&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{p, 0}&lt;/math&gt; is the phase shift of the acoustic pressure.

Taking the Laplace transforms of ''v'' and ''p'' with respect to time yields
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}(\mathbf{r},\, s) = v_\mathrm{m} \frac{s \cos \varphi_{v,0} - \omega \sin \varphi_{v,0}}{s^2 + \omega^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{p}(\mathbf{r},\, s) = p_\mathrm{m} \frac{s \cos \varphi_{p,0} - \omega \sin \varphi_{p,0}}{s^2 + \omega^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{v,0} = \varphi_{p,0}&lt;/math&gt;, the amplitude of the specific acoustic impedance is given by
:&lt;math&gt;z_\mathrm{m}(\mathbf{r},\, s) = |z(\mathbf{r},\, s)| = \left|\frac{\hat{p}(\mathbf{r},\, s)}{\hat{v}(\mathbf{r},\, s)}\right| = \frac{p_\mathrm{m}}{v_\mathrm{m}} = \frac{\rho c^2 k_x}{\omega}.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the amplitude of the particle displacement is related to that of the acoustic velocity and the sound pressure by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathrm{m} = \frac{v_\mathrm{m}}{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathrm{m} = \frac{p_\mathrm{m}}{\omega  z_\mathrm{m}(\mathbf{r},\, s)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Inverse-proportional law==
{{See|Inverse-square law}}
When measuring the sound pressure created by an object, it is important to measure the distance from the object as well, since the sound pressure of a ''spherical'' sound wave decreases as 1/''r'' from the centre of the sphere (and not as 1/''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, like the sound intensity):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Longhurst|first=R.S.|title=Geometrical and Physical Optics|year=1967|publisher=Longmans|location=Norwich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(r) \propto \frac{1}{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship is an ''inverse-proportional law''.

If the sound pressure ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is measured at a distance ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from the centre of the sphere, the sound pressure ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at another position ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be calculated:
:&lt;math&gt;p_2 = \frac{r_1}{r_2}\,p_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse-proportional law for sound pressure comes from the inverse-square law for sound intensity:
:&lt;math&gt;I(r) \propto \frac{1}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Indeed,
:&lt;math&gt;I(r) = p(r)v(r) = p(r)[p * z^{-1}](r) \propto p^2(r),&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[convolution]] operator;
*''z''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; is the convolution inverse of the [[specific acoustic impedance]],
hence the inverse-proportional law:
:&lt;math&gt;p(r) \propto \frac{1}{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

The sound pressure may vary in direction from the centre of the sphere as well, so measurements at different angles may be necessary, depending on the situation. An obvious example of a sound source whose spherical sound wave varies in level in different directions is a [[bullhorn]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Sound pressure level==
{{Other uses|Sound level (disambiguation){{!}}Sound level}}
'''Sound pressure level''' (SPL) or '''acoustic pressure level''' is a [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|logarithmic measure]] of the effective pressure of a sound relative to a reference value.&lt;br&gt;
Sound pressure level, denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and measured in [[Decibel|dB]], is defined by&lt;ref name=IEC60027-3&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/028981 &quot;Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology – Part 3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units&quot;], ''IEC 60027-3 Ed. 3.0'', International Electrotechnical Commission, 19 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_p = \ln\!\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{Np} = 2 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{B} = 20 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''p'' is the [[root mean square]] sound pressure;&lt;ref&gt;Bies, David A., and Hansen, Colin. (2003). ''Engineering Noise Control''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''reference sound pressure'';
*{{no break|1=1 Np = 1}} is the [[neper]];
*{{no break|1=1 B = (1/2) ln(10)}} is the [[Decibel|bel]];
*{{no break|1=1 dB = (1/20) ln(10)}} is the [[decibel]].

The commonly used reference sound pressure in air is&lt;ref&gt;Ross Roeser, Michael Valente, ''Audiology: Diagnosis'' (Thieme 2007), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_0 = 20~\mathrm{\mu Pa},&lt;/math&gt;
which is often considered as the [[threshold of human hearing]] (roughly the sound of a mosquito flying 3 m away). The proper notations for sound pressure level using this reference are {{nobreak|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''p''/(20 μPa)&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{nobreak|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; (re 20 μPa)}}, but the suffix notations {{nobreak|dB SPL}}, {{nobreak|dB(SPL)}}, dBSPL, or dB&lt;sub&gt;SPL&lt;/sub&gt; are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI.&lt;ref name=NIST2008&gt;Thompson, A. and Taylor, B. N. sec 8.7, &quot;Logarithmic quantities and units: level, neper, bel&quot;, ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) 2008 Edition'', NIST Special Publication 811, 2nd printing (November 2008), SP811 [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most sound level measurements will be made relative to this reference, meaning {{nobreak|1 Pa}} will equal an SPL of {{nobreak|94 dB}}. In other media, such as [[underwater acoustics|underwater]], a reference level of {{nobreak|1 μPa}} is used.&lt;ref name=Morfey&gt;{{cite book|last=Morfey|first=Christopher L.|title=Dictionary of Acoustics|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=978-0125069403}}&lt;/ref&gt; These references are defined in [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] S1.1-1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memtechacoustical.com/noise-terms-glossary |title=Noise Terms Glossary |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
The lower limit of audibility is defined as SPL of {{nobreak|0 dB}}, but the upper limit is not as clearly defined. While {{nobreak|1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]}} ({{nobreak|194 dB Peak}} or {{nobreak|191 dB SPL}}) is the largest pressure variation an undistorted sound wave can have in [[Earth's atmosphere]], larger sound waves can be present in other [[atmosphere]]s or other media such as under water, or through the Earth.

[[File:Lindos1.svg|thumb|right|300px|[[Equal-loudness contour]]]]

Ears detect changes in sound pressure. Human hearing does not have a flat [[spectral sensitivity]] ([[frequency response]]) relative to frequency versus [[amplitude]]. Humans do not perceive low- and high-frequency sounds as well as they perceive sounds near {{nobreak|2,000 Hz}}, as shown in the [[equal-loudness contour]]. Because the frequency response of human hearing changes with amplitude, three weightings have been established for measuring sound pressure: A, B and C. [[A-weighting]] applies to sound pressures levels up to {{nobreak|55 dB}}, B-weighting applies to sound pressures levels between {{nobreak|55 dB}} and {{nobreak|85 dB}}, and C-weighting is for measuring sound pressure levels above {{nobreak|85 dB}}.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In order to distinguish the different sound measures a suffix is used: A-weighted sound pressure level is written either as dB&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; or L&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. B-weighted sound pressure level is written either as dB&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; or L&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, and C-weighted sound pressure level is written either as dB&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; or L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. Unweighted sound pressure level is called &quot;linear sound pressure level&quot; and is often written as dB&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; or just L. Some sound measuring instruments use the letter &quot;Z&quot; as an indication of linear SPL.

===Distance===
The distance of the measuring microphone from a sound source is often omitted when SPL measurements are quoted, making the data useless. In the case of ambient environmental measurements of &quot;background&quot; noise, distance need not be quoted as no single source is present, but when measuring the noise level of a specific piece of equipment the distance should always be stated. A distance of one [[metre]] (1 m) from the source is a frequently used standard distance. Because of the effects of reflected noise within a closed room, the use of an [[anechoic chamber]] allows for sound to be comparable to measurements made in a free field environment.

According to the inverse proportional law, when sound level ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''p''1&lt;/sub&gt; is measured at a distance ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the sound level ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''p''2&lt;/sub&gt; at the distance ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;L_{p_2} = L_{p_1} + 20 \log_{10}\!\left( \frac{r_1}{r_2} \right)\!~\mathrm{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Multiple sources===
The formula for the sum of the sound pressure levels of ''n'' incoherent radiating sources is
:&lt;math&gt;L_\Sigma = 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{{p_1}^2 + {p_2}^2 + \ldots + {p_n}^2}{{p_0}^2}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB} = 10 \log_{10}\!\left[\left(\frac{p_1}{p_0}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{p_2}{p_0}\right)^2 + \ldots + \left(\frac{p_n}{p_0}\right)^2\right]\!~\mathrm{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting the formulas
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p_i}{p_0}\right)^2 = 10^{\frac{L_i}{10\,\mathrm{dB}}},\quad i = 1,\, 2,\, \ldots,\, n,&lt;/math&gt;
in the formula for the sum of the sound pressure levels yields
:&lt;math&gt;L_\Sigma = 10 \log_{10}\!\left(10^{\frac{L_1}{10\,\mathrm{dB}}} + 10^{\frac{L_2}{10\,\mathrm{dB}}} + \ldots + 10^{\frac{L_n}{10\,\mathrm{dB}}} \right)\!~\mathrm{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Particle velocity''' is the velocity of a particle (real or imagined) in a [[Transmission medium|medium]] as it transmits a [[wave]]. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of particle velocity is the metre per second (m/s). In many cases this is a [[longitudinal wave]] of [[pressure]] as with sound, but it can also be a [[transverse wave]] as with the vibration of a taut string.

When applied to a sound wave through a medium of a fluid like air, particle velocity would be the physical speed of a [[Fluid parcel|parcel of fluid]] as it moves back and forth in the direction the sound wave is travelling as it passes.

Particle velocity should not be confused with the speed of the [[wave]] as it passes through the medium, i.e. in the case of a sound wave, particle velocity is not the same as the [[speed of sound]]. The wave moves relatively fast, while the particles oscillate around their original position with a relatively small particle velocity. Particle velocity should also not be confused with the velocity of individual molecules.

In applications involving sound, the particle velocity is usually measured using a logarithmic [[decibel]] scale called [[particle velocity level]]. Mostly pressure sensors (microphones) are used to measure sound pressure which is then propagated to the velocity field using [[Green's function]].

==Mathematical definition==
Particle velocity, denoted '''v''', is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \frac{\partial \mathbf \delta}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''δ''' is the [[particle displacement]].

==Progressive sine waves==
The particle displacement of a ''progressive [[sine wave]]'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathbf{r},\, t) = \delta_\mathrm{m} \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{\delta, 0}),&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''δ''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[amplitude]] of the particle displacement;
*&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\delta, 0}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase shift]] of the particle displacement;
*'''k''' is the [[angular wavevector]];
*''ω'' is the [[angular frequency]].

It follows that the particle velocity and the sound pressure along the direction of propagation of the sound wave ''x'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt;v(\mathbf{r},\, t) = \frac{\partial \delta}{\partial t} (\mathbf{r},\, t) = \omega \delta_\mathrm{m} \cos\!\left(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{\delta, 0} + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = v_\mathrm{m} \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{v, 0}),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(\mathbf{r},\, t) = -\rho c^2 \frac{\partial \delta}{\partial x} (\mathbf{r},\, t) = \rho c^2 k_x \delta_\mathrm{m} \cos\!\left(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{\delta, 0} + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = p_\mathrm{m} \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{p, 0}),&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''v''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the amplitude of the particle velocity;
*&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{v, 0}&lt;/math&gt; is the phase shift of the particle velocity;
*''p''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the amplitude of the acoustic pressure;
*&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{p, 0}&lt;/math&gt; is the phase shift of the acoustic pressure.

Taking the Laplace transforms of ''v'' and ''p'' with respect to time yields
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}(\mathbf{r},\, s) = v_\mathrm{m} \frac{s \cos \varphi_{v,0} - \omega \sin \varphi_{v,0}}{s^2 + \omega^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{p}(\mathbf{r},\, s) = p_\mathrm{m} \frac{s \cos \varphi_{p,0} - \omega \sin \varphi_{p,0}}{s^2 + \omega^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{v,0} = \varphi_{p,0}&lt;/math&gt;, the amplitude of the specific acoustic impedance is given by
:&lt;math&gt;z_\mathrm{m}(\mathbf{r},\, s) = |z(\mathbf{r},\, s)| = \left|\frac{\hat{p}(\mathbf{r},\, s)}{\hat{v}(\mathbf{r},\, s)}\right| = \frac{p_\mathrm{m}}{v_\mathrm{m}} = \frac{\rho c^2 k_x}{\omega}.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the amplitude of the particle velocity is related to those of the particle displacement and the sound pressure by
:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{m} = \omega \delta_\mathrm{m},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{m} = \frac{p_\mathrm{m}}{z_\mathrm{m}(\mathbf{r},\, s)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Particle velocity level==
{{Other uses|Sound level (disambiguation){{!}}Sound level}}

'''Sound velocity level''' (SVL) or '''acoustic velocity level''' or '''particle velocity level''' is a [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|logarithmic measure]] of the effective particle velocity of a sound relative to a reference value.&lt;br&gt;
Sound velocity level, denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; and measured in [[Decibel|dB]], is defined by&lt;ref name=IEC60027-3&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/028981 &quot;Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology – Part 3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units&quot;], ''IEC 60027-3 Ed. 3.0'', International Electrotechnical Commission, 19 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

where

'''Particle displacement''' or '''displacement amplitude''' is a [[measurement]] of [[distance]] of the movement of a particle from its equilibrium position in a medium as it transmits a [[sound wave]].&lt;ref&gt;

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of particle displacement is the metre (m). In most cases this is a [[longitudinal wave]] of pressure (such as [[sound]]), but it can also be a [[transverse wave]], such as the [[oscillation|vibration]] of a taut string.  In the case of a [[sound wave]] travelling through [[air]], the '''particle displacement''' is evident in the [[oscillation]]s of air [[molecule]]s with, and against, the direction in which the sound wave is travelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particle of the medium undergoes displacement according to the [[particle velocity]] of the sound wave traveling through the medium, while the sound wave itself moves at the [[speed of sound]], equal to {{nobreak|343 m/s}} in air at {{nobreak|20 °C}}.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf \delta = \int_{t} \mathbf v\, \mathrm{d}t&lt;/math&gt;
where '''v''' is the [[particle velocity]].

==Progressive sine waves==
The particle displacement of a ''progressive [[sine wave]]'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathbf{r},\, t) = \delta \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{\delta, 0}),&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''δ'' is the [[amplitude]] of the particle displacement;
*&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\delta, 0}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase shift]] of the particle displacement;
*'''k''' is the [[angular wavevector]];
*''ω'' is the [[angular frequency]].

It follows that the particle velocity and the sound pressure along the direction of propagation of the sound wave ''x'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt;v(\mathbf{r},\, t) = \frac{\partial \delta}{\partial t} (\mathbf{r},\, t) = \omega \delta \cos\!\left(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{\delta, 0} + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = v \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{v, 0}),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(\mathbf{r},\, t) = -\rho c^2 \frac{\partial \delta}{\partial x} (\mathbf{r},\, t) = \rho c^2 k_x \delta \cos\!\left(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{\delta, 0} + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = p \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \varphi_{p, 0}),&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''v'' is the amplitude of the particle velocity;
*&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{v, 0}&lt;/math&gt; is the phase shift of the particle velocity;
*''p'' is the amplitude of the acoustic pressure;
*&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{p, 0}&lt;/math&gt; is the phase shift of the acoustic pressure.

Taking the Laplace transforms of ''v'' and ''p'' with respect to time yields
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}(\mathbf{r},\, s) = v \frac{s \cos \varphi_{v,0} - \omega \sin \varphi_{v,0}}{s^2 + \omega^2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{p}(\mathbf{r},\, s) = p \frac{s \cos \varphi_{p,0} - \omega \sin \varphi_{p,0}}{s^2 + \omega^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{v,0} = \varphi_{p,0}&lt;/math&gt;, the amplitude of the specific acoustic impedance is given by
:&lt;math&gt;z(\mathbf{r},\, s) = |z(\mathbf{r},\, s)| = \left|\frac{\hat{p}(\mathbf{r},\, s)}{\hat{v}(\mathbf{r},\, s)}\right| = \frac{p}{v} = \frac{\rho c^2 k_x}{\omega}.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the amplitude of the particle displacement is related to those of the particle velocity and the sound pressure by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{v}{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{p}{\omega z(\mathbf{r},\, s)}.&lt;/math&gt;

{{Sound measurements}}

'''Sound power''' or '''acoustic power''' is the rate at which [[sound energy]] is emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit time.&lt;ref name=clinical&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ElPyvaJbDiwC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=sound+power+loudness&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YF0XVdbsEpOBNoeFgKgN&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sound%20power%20loudness&amp;f=false|title=Clinical Measurement of Speech and Voice|author=Ronald J. Baken, Robert F. Orlikoff|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2000|isbn=9781565938694|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of sound power is the [[watt]] (W).&lt;ref name=clinical/&gt; It is the power of the sound force on a surface of the medium of propagation of the sound wave. For a sound source, unlike sound pressure, sound power is neither room-dependent nor distance-dependent. Sound pressure is a measurement at a point in space near the source, while the sound power of a source is the total power emitted by that source in all directions. Sound power passing through an area is sometimes called '''sound flux''' or '''acoustic flux''' through that area.



==Mathematical definition==
Sound power, denoted ''P'', is defined by&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Lifshitz, &quot;Fluid Mechanics&quot;, Course of Theoretical Physics, Vol. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = \mathbf f \cdot \mathbf v = Ap\, \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v = Apv&lt;/math&gt;
where
*'''f''' is the sound force of unit vector '''u''';
*'''v''' is the [[particle velocity]] of projection ''v'' along '''u''';
*''A'' is the area;
*''p'' is the [[sound pressure]].

In a [[Transmission medium|medium]], the sound power is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{A p^2}{\rho c} \cos \theta,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''A'' is the area of the surface;
*''ρ'' is the [[mass density]];
*''c'' is the [[sound velocity]];
*''θ'' is the angle between the direction of propagation of the sound and the normal to the surface.

For example a sound at SPL = 85&amp;nbsp;dB or ''p'' = 0.356 Pa in air (''ρ'' = 1.2&amp;nbsp;kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c'' = 343 m·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) through a surface of area ''A'' = 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; normal to the direction of propagation (''θ'' = 0 °) has a sound energy flux ''P'' = 0.3&amp;nbsp;mW.

This is the parameter one would be interested in when converting noise back into usable energy, along with any losses in the capturing device.

==Relationships with other quantities==
Sound power is related to [[sound intensity]]:
:&lt;math&gt;P = AI,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''A'' is the area;
*''I'' is the sound intensity.

Sound power is related [[sound energy density]]:
:&lt;math&gt;P = Acw,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''c'' is the [[speed of sound]];
*''w'' is the sound energy density.

==Sound power level==
{{Other uses|Sound level (disambiguation){{!}}Sound level}}
'''Sound power level''' (SWL) or '''acoustic power level''' is a [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|logarithmic measure]] of the power of a sound relative to a reference value.&lt;br&gt;
Sound power level, denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; and measured in [[Decibel|dB]], is defined by&lt;ref name=IEC60027-3&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/028981 &quot;Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology – Part 3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units&quot;], ''IEC 60027-3 Ed. 3.0'', International Electrotechnical Commission, 19 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_W = \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{Np} = \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{B} = 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''P'' is the sound power;
*''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''reference sound power'';
*{{no break|1=1 Np = 1}} is the [[neper]];
*{{no break|1=1 B = (1/2) ln(10)}} is the [[Decibel|bel]];
*{{no break|1=1 dB = (1/20) ln(10)}} is the [[decibel]].

The commonly used reference sound power in air is&lt;ref&gt;Ross Roeser, Michael Valente, ''Audiology: Diagnosis'' (Thieme 2007), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = 1~\mathrm{pW}.&lt;/math&gt;
The proper notations for sound power level using this reference are {{nobreak|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''W''/(1 pW)&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{nobreak|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; (re 1 pW)}}, but the suffix notations {{nobreak|dB SWL}}, {{nobreak|dB(SWL)}}, dBSWL, or dB&lt;sub&gt;SWL&lt;/sub&gt; are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI.&lt;ref name=NIST2008&gt;Thompson, A. and Taylor, B. N. sec 8.7, &quot;Logarithmic quantities and units: level, neper, bel&quot;, ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) 2008 Edition'', NIST Special Publication 811, 2nd printing (November 2008), SP811 [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference sound power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the sound power with the reference sound intensity {{nobreak|1=''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 pW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} passing through a surface of area {{nobreak|1=''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}:
:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = A_0 I_0,&lt;/math&gt;
hence the reference value {{nobreak|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 pW}}.

===Relationship with sound pressure level===
In the case of a free field sound source in air at ambient temperature, the sound power level at distance ''r'' from the sound source is approximately related to [[sound pressure level]] (SPL)  by&lt;ref name=Chadderton&gt;Chadderton, David V. ''Building services engineering'', pp. 301, 306, 309, 322. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. ISBN 0-415-31535-2&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_W = L_p + 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{4\pi r^2}{A_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''L''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sound pressure level;
*{{nobreak|1=''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Derivation of this equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_W &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{AI}{A_0 I_0}\right)\\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right) + \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{A}{A_0}\right)\!.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
For a ''progressive'' spherical wave,
:&lt;math&gt;z_0 = \frac{p}{v},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Acoustic impedance#Characteristic specific acoustic impedance|characteristic specific acoustic impedance]].

Consequently,
:&lt;math&gt;I = pv = \frac{p^2}{z_0},&lt;/math&gt;
and since by definition {{nobreak|1=''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{nobreak|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 20 μPa}} is the reference sound pressure,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_W &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{p^2}{p_0^2}\right) + \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{4\pi r^2}{A_0}\right)\\
        &amp;= \ln\!\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right) + \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{4\pi r^2}{A_0}\right)\\
        &amp;= L_p + 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{4\pi r^2}{A_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The sound power estimated practically does not depend on distance, though theoretically it may diminish with distance due to viscous effects in the propagation of sound.

Sound is a [[mechanical wave]] and as such consists physically in [[Oscillation|oscillatory]] elastic [[Compression (physics)|compression]] and in oscillatory displacement of a [[fluid]]. Therefore, the [[transmission medium|medium]] acts as [[Energy storage|storage]] for both [[Potential energy|potential]] and [[kinetic energy]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Consequently, the sound energy in a volume of interest is defined as the sum of the potential and kinetic [[Energy density|energy densities]] integrated over that volume:
:&lt;math&gt;W = W_\mathrm{potential} + W_\mathrm{kinetic} = \int_V \frac{p^2}{2 \rho_0 c^2}\, \mathrm{d}V + \int_V \frac{\rho v^2}{2}\, \mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;

'''Sound energy density''' or '''sound density''' is the [[sound energy]] per unit volume. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of sound energy density is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa), that is the [[joule]] per [[cubic metre]] (J/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) in SI based units.

==Mathematical definition==
Sound energy density, denoted ''w'', is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;w = \frac{p v}{c}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''p'' is the [[sound pressure]];
*''v'' is the [[particle velocity]] in the direction of propagation;
*''c'' is the [[speed of sound]].

The terms instantaneous energy density, maximum energy density, and peak energy density have meanings analogous to the related terms used for sound pressure. In speaking of average energy density, it is necessary to distinguish between the space average (at a given instant) and the time average (at a given point).

==Relationships with other quantities==
Sound energy density is related to [[sound intensity]]:
:&lt;math&gt;w = \frac{I}{c},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''I'' is the sound intensity;
*''c'' is the [[speed of sound]].

Sound energy density is related [[sound power]]:
:&lt;math&gt;w = \frac{P}{Ac},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''P'' is the sound power;
*''A'' is the area.

'''Sound exposure''' is the integral, over time, of squared [[sound pressure]]. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of sound exposure is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] squared second (Pa&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s).

==Mathematical definition==
Sound exposure, denoted ''E'', is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;E = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} p(t)^2\, \mathrm{d}t,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*the exposure is being calculated for the time interval between times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;;
*''p(t)'' is the [[sound pressure]] at time ''t'', usually [[A-weighted]] for sound in air.

==Sound exposure level==

'''Sound exposure level''' (SEL) or '''acoustic exposure level''' is a [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|logarithmic measure]] of the sound exposure of a sound relative to a reference value.&lt;br&gt;
Sound exposure level, denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; and measured in [[Decibel|dB]], is defined by&lt;ref name=IEC60027-3&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/028981 &quot;Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology – Part 3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units&quot;], ''IEC 60027-3 Ed. 3.0'', International Electrotechnical Commission, 19 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_E = \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{E}{E_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{Np} = \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{E}{E_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{B} = 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{E}{E_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB},&lt;/math&gt;

'''Acoustic impedance''' and '''specific acoustic impedance''' are measures of the opposition that a system presents to the acoustic flow resulting of an acoustic pressure applied to the system. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of acoustic impedance is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] second per cubic metre ({{nobreak|Pa·s/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}) or the [[rayl]] per square metre ({{nobreak|rayl/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), while that of specific acoustic impedance is the pascal second per metre ({{nobreak|Pa·s/m}}) or the rayl.&lt;ref name=Kinsler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kinsler|first1=Lawrence|last2=Frey|first2=Austin|last3=Coppens|first3=Alan|last4=Sanders|first4=James|year=2000|title=Fundamentals of Acoustics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-84789-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this article the symbol rayl denotes the MKS rayl. There is a [[Mechanical-electrical analogies#Impedance analogies|close analogy]] with [[electrical impedance]], which measures the opposition that a system presents to the electrical flow resulting of an electrical voltage applied to the system.

==Mathematical definitions==
===Acoustic impedance===
For a [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant]] system, the relationship between the acoustic pressure applied to the system and the resulting acoustic [[volume flow rate]] through a surface perpendicular to the direction of that pressure at its point of application is given by
: &lt;math&gt;p(t) = [R * Q](t),&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently by
: &lt;math&gt;Q(t) = [G * p](t),&lt;/math&gt;
where

'''Acoustic impedance''', denoted ''Z'', is the [[Laplace transform]], or the [[Fourier transform]], or the [[Analytic signal|analytic representation]] of ''time domain'' acoustic resistance:&lt;ref name=Kinsler /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z(s) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} \mathcal{L}[R](s) = \frac{\mathcal{L}[p](s)}{\mathcal{L}[Q](s)},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z(\omega) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} \mathcal{F}[R](\omega) = \frac{\mathcal{F}[p](\omega)}{\mathcal{F}[Q](\omega)},&lt;/math&gt;

* in ''Z''(''ω''), ''R''(''ω'') is ''not'' the Fourier transform of the time domain acoustic resistance ''R''(''t''), ''Z''(''ω'') is;
* in ''Z''(''t''), ''R''(''t'') is the time domain acoustic resistance and ''X''(''t'') is the [[Hilbert transform]] of the time domain acoustic resistance ''R''(''t''), according to the definition of the analytic representation.

'''Inductive acoustic reactance''', denoted ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''capacitive acoustic reactance''', denoted ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;, are the [[positive part]] and [[negative part]] of acoustic reactance respectively:
: &lt;math&gt;X(s) = X_L(s) - X_C(s),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;X(\omega) = X_L(\omega) - X_C(\omega),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;X(t) = X_L(t) - X_C(t).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Acoustic admittance''', denoted ''Y'', is the Laplace transform, or the Fourier transform, or the analytic representation of ''time domain'' acoustic conductance:&lt;ref name=Kinsler /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} \mathcal{L}[G](s) = \frac{1}{Z(s)} = \frac{\mathcal{L}[Q](s)}{\mathcal{L}[p](s)},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y(\omega) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} \mathcal{F}[G](\omega) = \frac{1}{Z(\omega)} = \frac{\mathcal{F}[Q](\omega)}{\mathcal{F}[p](\omega)},&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''Z''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; is the convolution inverse of ''Z''; 
* ''p''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; is the convolution inverse of ''p''.

'''Acoustic conductance''', denoted ''G'', and '''acoustic susceptance''', denoted ''B'', are the real part and imaginary part of acoustic admittance respectively:
: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = G(s) + iB(s),&lt;/math&gt;

* in ''Y''(''t''), ''G''(''t'') is the time domain acoustic conductance and ''B''(''t'') is the [[Hilbert transform]] of the time domain acoustic conductance ''G''(''t''), according to the definition of the analytic representation.

Acoustic resistance represents the energy transfer of an acoustic wave. The pressure and motion are in phase, so work is done on the medium ahead of the wave.

Acoustic reactance represents, as well, the pressure that is out of phase with the motion and causes no average energy transfer. For example, a closed bulb connected to an organ pipe will have air moving into it and pressure, but they are out of phase so no net energy is transmitted into it. While the pressure rises, air moves in, and while it falls, it moves out, but the average pressure when the air moves in is the same as that when it moves out, so the power flows back and forth but with no time averaged energy transfer. The electrical analogy for this is a capacitor connected across a power line. Current flows through the capacitor but it is out of phase with the voltage, so no net power is transmitted into it.

===Specific acoustic impedance===
For a [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant]] system, the relationship between the acoustic pressure applied to the system and the resulting [[particle velocity]] in the direction of that pressure at its point of application is given by
: &lt;math&gt;p(t) = [r * v](t),&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently by:
: &lt;math&gt;v(t) = [g * p](t),&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''p'' is the acoustic pressure;
* ''v'' is the particle velocity;
* ''r'' is the '''specific acoustic resistance in the ''time domain''''';
* ''g'' = ''r''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; is the '''specific acoustic conductance in the ''time domain''''' (''r''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; is the convolution inverse of ''r'').

'''Specific acoustic impedance''', denoted ''z'' is the Laplace transform, or the Fourier transform, or the analytic representation of ''time domain'' specific acoustic resistance:&lt;ref name=Kinsler /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z(s) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} \mathcal{L}[r](s) = \frac{\mathcal{L}[p](s)}{\mathcal{L}[v](s)},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z(\omega) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} \mathcal{F}[r](\omega) = \frac{\mathcal{F}[p](\omega)}{\mathcal{F}[v](\omega)},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z(t) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} r_\mathrm{a}(t) = \frac{1}{2}\!\left[p_\mathrm{a} * \left(v^{-1}\right)_\mathrm{a}\right]\!(t),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; is the convolution inverse of ''v''.

'''Specific acoustic resistance''', denoted ''r'', and '''specific acoustic reactance''', denoted ''x'', are the real part and imaginary part of specific acoustic impedance respectively:
: &lt;math&gt;z(s) = r(s) + ix(s),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z(\omega) = r(\omega) + ix(\omega),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z(t) = r(t) + ix(t),&lt;/math&gt;
where
* in ''z''(''s''), ''r''(''s'') is ''not'' the Laplace transform of the time domain specific acoustic resistance ''r''(''t''), ''z''(''s'') is;
* in ''z''(''ω''), ''r''(''ω'') is ''not'' the Fourier transform of the time domain specific acoustic resistance ''r''(''t''), ''z''(''ω'') is;
* in ''z''(''t''), ''r''(''t'') is the time domain specific acoustic resistance and ''x''(''t'') is the [[Hilbert transform]] of the time domain specific acoustic resistance ''r''(''t''), according to the definition of the analytic representation.

'''Specific inductive acoustic reactance''', denoted ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''specific capacitive acoustic reactance''', denoted ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;, are the positive part and negative part of specific acoustic reactance respectively:
: &lt;math&gt;x(s) = x_L(s) - x_C(s),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x(\omega) = x_L(\omega) - x_C(\omega),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x(t) = x_L(t) - x_C(t).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Specific acoustic admittance''', denoted ''y'', is the Laplace transform, or the Fourier transform, or the analytic representation of ''time domain'' specific acoustic conductance:&lt;ref name=Kinsler /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y(s) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} \mathcal{L}[g](s) = \frac{1}{z(s)} = \frac{\mathcal{L}[v](s)}{\mathcal{L}[p](s)},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y(\omega) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} \mathcal{F}[g](\omega) = \frac{1}{z(\omega)} = \frac{\mathcal{F}[v](\omega)}{\mathcal{F}[p](\omega)},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y(t) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} g_\mathrm{a}(t) = z^{-1}(t) = \frac{1}{2}\!\left[v_\mathrm{a} * \left(p^{-1}\right)_\mathrm{a}\right]\!(t),&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''z''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; is the convolution inverse of ''z'';
* ''p''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; is the convolution inverse of ''p''.

'''Specific acoustic conductance''', denoted ''g'', and '''specific acoustic susceptance''', denoted ''b'', are the real part and imaginary part of specific acoustic admittance respectively:
: &lt;math&gt;y(s) = g(s) + ib(s),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y(\omega) = g(\omega) + ib(\omega),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y(t) = g(t) + ib(t),&lt;/math&gt;
where
* in ''y''(''s''), ''g''(''s'') is ''not'' the Laplace transform of the time domain acoustic conductance ''g''(''t''), ''y''(''s'') is;
* in ''y''(''ω''), ''g''(''ω'') is ''not'' the Fourier transform of the time domain acoustic conductance ''g''(''t''), ''y''(''ω'') is;
* in ''y''(''t''), ''g''(''t'') is the time domain acoustic conductance and ''b''(''t'') is the [[Hilbert transform]] of the time domain acoustic conductance ''g''(''t''), according to the definition of the analytic representation.

Specific acoustic impedance ''z'' is an [[intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] of a particular ''medium'': for instance, the ''z'' of air or of water can be specified. Whereas acoustic impedance ''Z'' is an [[intensive and extensive properties|extensive property]] of a particular ''medium and geometry'': for instance, the ''Z'' of a particular duct filled with air can be discussed.

===Relationship===
A ''one dimensional'' wave passing through an aperture with area ''A'' is now considered. The acoustic volume flow rate ''Q'' is the volume of medium passing per second through the aperture. If the acoustic flow moves a distance d''x'' = ''v'' d''t'', then the volume of medium passing through is d''V'' = ''A'' d''x'', so
: &lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}t} = A \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = A v.&lt;/math&gt;
Provided that the wave is only one-dimensional, it yields
: &lt;math&gt;Z(s) = \frac{\mathcal{L}[p](s)}{\mathcal{L}[Q](s)} = \frac{\mathcal{L}[p](s)}{A \mathcal{L}[v](s)} = \frac{z(s)}{A},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z(\omega) = \frac{\mathcal{F}[p](\omega)}{\mathcal{F}[Q](\omega)} = \frac{\mathcal{F}[p](\omega)}{A \mathcal{F}[v](\omega)} = \frac{z(\omega)}{A},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z(t) = \frac{1}{2}\!\left[p_\mathrm{a} * \left(Q^{-1}\right)_\mathrm{a}\right]\!(t) = \frac{1}{2}\!\left[p_\mathrm{a} * \left(\frac{v^{-1}}{A}\right)_\mathrm{a}\right]\!(t) = \frac{z(t)}{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Characteristic acoustic impedance==
===Characteristic specific acoustic impedance===
The constitutive law of nondispersive linear acoustics in one dimension gives a relation between stress and strain:&lt;ref name=Kinsler /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;p = -\rho c^2 \frac{\partial \delta}{\partial x},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''p'' is the [[sound pressure|acoustic pressure]] in the medium;
* ''ρ'' is the [[density|volumetric mass density]] of the medium;
* ''c'' is the [[speed of sound|speed of the sound]] waves traveling in the medium;
* ''δ'' is the [[particle displacement]];
* ''x'' is the space variable along the direction of propagation of the sound waves.

This equation is valid both for fluids and solids. In
* [[fluids]], ''ρc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''K'' (''K'' stands for the [[bulk modulus]]);
* [[solids]], ''ρc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''K'' + 4/3 ''G'' (''G'' stands for the [[shear modulus]]) for [[longitudinal wave]]s and ''ρc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''G'' for [[transverse wave]]s.

[[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]] applied locally in the medium gives
: &lt;math&gt;\rho \frac{\partial^2 \delta}{\partial t^2} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;
Combining this equation with the previous one yields the one-dimensional [[wave equation]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \delta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial \delta^2}{\partial x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The ''plane waves''
: &lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathbf{r},\, t) = \delta(x,\, t)&lt;/math&gt;
that are solutions of this wave equation are composed of the sum of ''two progressive plane waves'' traveling along ''x'' with the same speed and ''in opposite ways'':
: &lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathbf{r},\, t) = f(x - ct) + g(x + ct)&lt;/math&gt;
from which can be derived
: &lt;math&gt;v(\mathbf{r},\, t) = \frac{\partial \delta}{\partial t}(\mathbf{r},\, t) = -c\big[f'(x - ct) - g'(x + ct)\big],&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;p(\mathbf{r},\, t) = -\rho c^2 \frac{\partial \delta}{\partial x}(\mathbf{r},\, t) = -\rho c^2 \big[f'(x - ct) + g'(x + ct)\big].&lt;/math&gt;
For ''progressive'' plane waves
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
p(\mathbf{r},\, t) = -\rho c^2\, f'(x - ct)\\
v(\mathbf{r},\, t) = -c\, f'(x - ct)
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
p(\mathbf{r},\, t) = -\rho c^2\, g'(x + ct)\\
v(\mathbf{r},\, t) = c\, g'(x + ct).
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, the specific acoustic impedance ''z'' is
: &lt;math&gt;z(\mathbf{r},\, s) = \frac{\mathcal{L}[p](\mathbf{r},\, s)}{\mathcal{L}[v](\mathbf{r},\, s)} = \pm \rho c,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z(\mathbf{r},\, \omega) = \frac{\mathcal{F}[p](\mathbf{r},\, \omega)}{\mathcal{F}[v](\mathbf{r},\, \omega)} = \pm \rho c,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z(\mathbf{r},\, t) = \frac{1}{2}\!\left[p_\mathrm{a} * \left(v^{-1}\right)_\mathrm{a}\right]\!(\mathbf{r},\, t) = \pm \rho c.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[absolute value]] of this specific acoustic impedance is often called '''characteristic specific acoustic impedance''' and denoted ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name=Kinsler /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z_0 = \rho c.&lt;/math&gt;
The equations also show that
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{p(\mathbf{r},\, t)}{v(\mathbf{r},\, t)} = \pm \rho c = \pm z_0.&lt;/math&gt;

''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; varies greatly among media, especially between gas and condensed phases. Water is 800 times denser than air and its speed of sound is 4.3 times greater than that of air. So the specific acoustic impedance of water is 3,500 times higher than that of air. This means that a sound in water with a given pressure amplitude is 3,500 times less intense than one in air with the same pressure. This is because the air, with its lower ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, moves with a much greater velocity and displacement amplitude than does water. Reciprocally, if a sound in water and another in air have the same intensity, then the pressure is much smaller in air. These variations lead to important differences between [[room acoustics]] or atmospheric acoustics on the one hand, and [[underwater acoustics]] on the other.

Besides, temperature acts on speed of sound and mass density and thus on specific acoustic impedance.

===Characteristic acoustic impedance===
For a ''one dimensional'' wave passing through an aperture with area ''A'', ''Z'' = ''z''/''A'', so if the wave is a progressive plane wave, then
: &lt;math&gt;Z(\mathbf{r},\, s) = \pm \frac{\rho c}{A},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z(\mathbf{r},\, \omega) = \pm \frac{\rho c}{A},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z(\mathbf{r},\, t) = \pm \frac{\rho c}{A}.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[absolute value]] of this acoustic impedance is often called '''characteristic acoustic impedance''' and denoted ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name=Kinsler /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \frac{\rho c}{A}.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly to the characteristic specific acoustic impedance,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{p(\mathbf{r},\, t)}{Q(\mathbf{r},\, t)} = \pm \frac{\rho c}{A} = \pm Z_0.&lt;/math&gt;

If the aperture with area ''A'' is the start of a pipe and a plane wave is sent into the pipe, the wave passing through the aperture is a progressive plane wave in the absence of reflections. There are usually reflections from the other end of the pipe, whether open or closed, so there is a sum of waves travelling from one end to the other. The reflections and resultant standing waves are very important in musical wind instruments. It is possible to have no reflections when the pipe is very long, because it then takes a long time for the reflected waves to return and, when it does, they are much attenuated by losses at the wall.

{{Sound measurements}}

An '''audio frequency''' (abbreviation: '''AF''') or '''audible frequency''' is characterized as a [[periodic function|periodic]] [[vibration]] whose [[frequency]] is audible to the average human. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of audio frequency is the [[hertz]] (Hz). It is the property of [[sound]] that most determines [[Pitch (music)|pitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Pilhofer |first1=Michael |title=Music Theory for Dummies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CxcviUw4KX8C|year=2007|publisher=For Dummies|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generally accepted standard range of audible frequencies is 20 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyperphysics|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/earsens.html|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heffner|first1=Henry|last2=Heffner|first2=Rickye|title=Hearing Ranges of Laboratory Animals|journal=American Association for Laboratory Animal Science|date=January 2007|volume=46|issue=1|page=20|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aalas/jaalas/2007/00000046/00000001/art00003|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stuart|title=Signals and Systems for Speech and Hearing|date=2011|publisher=BRILL|page=163|edition=2nd|quote=For auditory signals and human listeners, the accepted range is 20Hz to 20kHz, the limits of human hearing}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the range of frequencies individuals hear is greatly influenced by environmental factors. Frequencies below 20&amp;nbsp;Hz are generally felt rather than heard, assuming the [[amplitude]] of the vibration is great enough. Frequencies above 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz can sometimes be sensed by young people. High frequencies are the first to be affected by [[hearing loss]] due to age and/or prolonged exposure to very loud noises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bitner-Glindzicz|first1=M|title=Hereditary deafness and phenotyping in humans.|journal=British medical bulletin|date=2002|volume=63|issue=1|pages=73-94|pmid=12324385|accessdate=22 September 2014|doi=10.1093/bmb/63.1.73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sound measurements}}
'''Transmission loss''' (TL) in duct [[acoustics]], together with insertion loss (IL), describes the acoustic performances of a [[muffler]] like system. It is frequently used in the industry areas such as [[muffler]] manufacturers and [[Noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]] department of automobile manufacturers. Generally the higher transmission loss of a system it has, the better it will perform in terms of noise cancellation.

== Introduction ==
Transmission loss (TL) (more specifically in duct acoustics) is defined as the difference between the [[Sound intensity|power incident]] on a duct acoustic device ([[muffler]]) and that transmitted downstream into an anechoic termination. Transmission loss is independent of the source and presumes (or requires) an anechoic termination at the downstream end.&lt;ref name=Munjal_ADM /&gt;

Transmission loss does not involve the source [[Acoustic impedance|impedance]] and the radiation impedance inasmuch as it represents the difference between incident acoustic energy and that transmitted into an anechoic environment. Being made independent of the terminations, TL finds favor with researchers who are sometimes interested in finding the acoustic transmission behavior of an element or a set of elements in isolation of the terminations. But measurement of the incident wave in a standing wave acoustic field requires uses of impedance tube technology, may be quite laborious, unless one makes use of the two-microphone method with modern instrumentation.&lt;ref name=Munjal_ADM&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munjal|first1=M.L.|title=Acoustics of ducts and mufflers with application to exhaust and ventilation system design|date=1987|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0471847380|pages=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical definition ==
[[File:Transmission Loss Duct Acoustics TL Def Plot.png|thumb|500px|Transmission loss (duct acoustics) definition illustration.]]
By definition the TL on an acoustic component, for example a muffler, is described as:&lt;ref name=Munjal_ADM /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; TL = L_{Wi} - L_{Wo} = 10 \log_{10} \left\vert {S_i p_{i+} v_{i+} \over 2} {2\over S_o p_o v_0 }\right\vert = 10 \log_{10} \left\vert {S_i p_{i+}^2 \over S_o p_o^2 }\right\vert &lt;/math&gt;
where:
*&lt;math&gt;L_{Wi}&lt;/math&gt; is the incident sound power in the inlet coming towards muffler;
*&lt;math&gt;L_{Wo}&lt;/math&gt; is the transmitted sound power going downstream in the outlet out of the muffler;
*&lt;math&gt;S_i, S_o&lt;/math&gt; stand for the cross-sectional area of the inlet and outlet of muffler;
*&lt;math&gt;p_{i+}&lt;/math&gt; is the acoustic pressure of the incident wave in the inlet, towards muffler;
*&lt;math&gt;p_o&lt;/math&gt; is the acoustic pressure of the transmitted wave in the outlet, away from muffler.
*&lt;math&gt;v_{i+}&lt;/math&gt; is the particle velocity of the incident wave in the inlet, towards muffler;
*&lt;math&gt;v_o&lt;/math&gt; is the particle velocity of the transmitted wave in the outlet, away from muffler.
Note that &lt;math&gt;p_{i+}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be measured directly in isolation from the reflected wave pressure &lt;math&gt;p_{i-}&lt;/math&gt; (in the inlet, away from muffler). One has to resort to impedance tube technology or two-microphone method with modern instrumentation.&lt;ref name=Munjal_ADM /&gt; However at the downstream side of the muffler, &lt;math&gt;p_o = p_{o+}&lt;/math&gt; in view of the anechoic termination, which ensures &lt;math&gt;p_{o-} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

And in most muffler applications, ''Si'' and ''So'', the area of the exhaust pipe and tail pipe, are generally made equal, thus we have:
:&lt;math&gt; TL = 20 \log_{10} \left\vert {p_{i+} \over p_o}\right\vert&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, TL equals 20 times the logarithm (to the base 10) of the ratio of the acoustic pressure associated with the incident wave (in the exhaust pipe) and that of the transmitted wave (in the tail pipe), with the two pipes having the same cross-sectional area and the tail pipe terminating anechoically.&lt;ref name=Munjal_ADM /&gt; However this anechoic condition is normally difficult to meet under practical industry environment, thus it is usually more convenient for the muffler manufacturers to measure insertions loss during their muffler performance tests under working conditions (mounted on an engine).

Also, since the transmitted sound power cannot possibly exceed the incident sound power (or &lt;math&gt;\left\vert p_{i+}\right\vert&lt;/math&gt; is always larger than &lt;math&gt;\left\vert p_{o}\right\vert&lt;/math&gt;), it is known that TL will never be less than 0&amp;nbsp;dB.

== Transmission matrix description ==
[[File:Transmission Loss Duct Acoustics TL Def with Matrix Plot.png|thumb|400px|Transmission loss (duct acoustics) definition illustration with transmission matrix.]]
The low-frequency approximation implies that each subsystem is an acoustic two-port (or four-pole system) with two (and only two) unknown parameters, the complex amplitudes of two interfering waves travelling in opposite directions. Such a system can be described by its transmission matrix (or four-pole matrix), as follows&lt;ref name=DTU_prop_Jacobsen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobsen|first1=Finn|title=Propagation of sound waves in ducts - DTU|date=2000|publisher=Technical University of Denmark|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}
\hat p_i \\
\hat q_i
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
A &amp; B \\
C &amp; D
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat p_o \\
\hat q_o
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\hat p_i&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\hat p_o&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\hat q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat q_o&lt;/math&gt; are the sound pressures and volume velocities at the input and at the output. A, B, C and D are complex numbers. With this representation it can be prove that the transmission loss (TL) of this subsystem can be calculated as,
:&lt;math&gt; TL = 10 \log_{10}\left( {{1 \over 4} \left\vert { A + B {S \over \rho c} + C { \rho c \over S} + D }\right\vert^2}\right )&lt;/math&gt;,
where:
*&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is inlet and outlet cross-sectional area;
*&lt;math&gt;\rho c&lt;/math&gt; are media density and sound velocity.

== A simple example ==
[[File:Transmission Loss Duct Acoustics TL Simple Example.png|thumb|400px|Transmission loss (duct acoustics) calculation - a simple example (one chamber silencer).]]
[[File:Transmission Loss Duct Acoustics TL Simple Example Matlab Result.png|thumb|400px|Result of transmission loss (duct acoustics) calculation - a simple example (one chamber silencer). ''c''=520m/s at 400&amp;deg;C; ''l''=0.5m; h=1/3.]]
Considering we have the most simplest reactive silencer with only one expansion chamber (length l and cross-sectional area S2), with inlet and outlet both having cross-sectional area S1). As we know the transmission matrix of a tube (in this case, the expansion chamber) is&lt;ref name=DTU_prop_Jacobsen /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}
A &amp; B \\
C &amp; D
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
{\cos kl} &amp; {j {\rho c \over S_2} \sin kl}\\
{j {S_2\over \rho c} \sin kl} &amp; {\cos kl} 
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.
Substitute to the equation of TL above, it can be seen that the TL of this simple reactive silencer is
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} TL &amp; = 10 \log_{10}\left (  {{1 \over 4} \left\vert { {\cos kl} + {j {S_1 \over S_2} \sin kl} + {j {S_2\over S_1} \sin kl} + {\cos kl} }\right\vert^2} \right ) \\
&amp; = 10 \log_{10}\left ({{\cos^2 kl} +{1 \over 4} \left (h + {1 \over h}\right )^2 {\sin^2 kl}}\right ) \\
&amp; = 10 \log_{10}\left ({1 +{1 \over 4} \left (h - {1 \over h}\right )^2 {\sin^2 kl}}\right ),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of the cross-sectional areas and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the chamber. &lt;math&gt;k=\omega / c&lt;/math&gt; is the wave number while &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the sound speed. Note that the transmission loss is zero when &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of half a wavelength.

As a simple example, consider a one chamber silencer with ''h''=''S1''/''S2''=1/3, at around 400&amp;nbsp;°C the sound speed is about 520&amp;nbsp;m/s, with ''l''=0.5 m, one easily calculate the TL result shown on the plot on the right. Note that the TL equals zero when frequency is a multiple of &lt;math&gt;c \over {2 l}&lt;/math&gt; and TL peaks when frequency is &lt;math&gt;{c \over {4 l}} + {n * {c \over {2 l}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Also note that the above calculation is only valid for low-frequency range because at low-frequency range the sound wave can be treated as a plane wave. The TL calculation will start losing its accuracy when the frequency goes above the [[cutoff frequency]], which can be calculated as  &lt;math&gt;f_c = 1.84 {c \over {\pi D}}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=Munjal_ADM /&gt; where ''D'' is diameter of the largest pipe in the structure. In the case above, if for example the muffler body has a diameter of 300mm, then the cut-off frequency is then 1.84*520/pi/0.3=1015&amp;nbsp;Hz.

In [[radiometry]], '''radiant flux''' or '''radiant power''' is the [[radiant energy]] emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit time, and '''spectral flux''' or '''spectral power''' is the radiant flux per unit [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]], depending on whether the [[Spectral radiometric quantity|spectrum]] is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of radiant flux is the [[watt]] (W), that is the [[joule]] per second ({{nobreak|J/s}}) in SI base units, while that of spectral flux in frequency is the watt per [[hertz]] ({{nobreak|W/Hz}}) and that of spectral flux in wavelength is the watt per metre ({{nobreak|W/m}})—commonly the watt per nanometre ({{nobreak|W/nm}}).

==Mathematical definitions==
===Radiant flux===
'''Radiant flux''', denoted Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] quantities), is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e} = \frac{\partial Q_\mathrm{e}}{\partial t},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*∂ is the [[partial derivative]] symbol;
*''Q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the radiant energy emitted, reflected, transmitted or received;
*''t'' is the time.

===Spectral flux===
'''Spectral flux in frequency''', denoted Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,ν&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\nu} = \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \nu},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ν'' is the frequency.

'''Spectral flux in wavelength''', denoted Φ&lt;sub&gt;e,λ&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' is the wavelength.

==Relationship with the Poynting vector==
One can show that the radiant flux of a ''surface'' is the [[flux]] of the [[Poynting vector]] through this surface, hence the name &quot;radiant flux&quot;:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e} = \oint_\Sigma \mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}\, \mathrm{d}A = \oint_\Sigma |\mathbf{S}| \cos \alpha\, \mathrm{d}A,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''Σ'' is the surface;
*'''S''' is the Poynting vector;
*'''n''' is a unit [[Normal (geometry)|normal vector]] to that surface;
*''A'' is the area of that surface;
*''α'' is the angle between '''n''' and '''S'''.
But the time-average of the norm of the Poynting vector is used instead, because in radiometry it is the only quantity that radiation detectors are able to measure:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\mathrm{e} = \oint_\Sigma \langle|\mathbf{S}|\rangle \cos \alpha\, \mathrm{d}A,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt; • &gt; is the time-average.

In [[radiometry]], '''radiosity''' is the [[radiant flux]] ''leaving'' (emitted, reflected and transmitted by) a ''surface'' per unit area, and '''spectral radiosity''' is the radiosity of a ''surface'' per unit [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]], depending on whether the [[Spectral radiometric quantity|spectrum]] is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/quantity/Instances.html#Radiosity. Accessed 2013-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of radiosity is the [[watt]] per square metre ({{nobreak|W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), while that of spectral radiosity in frequency is the watt per square metre per [[hertz]] (W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and that of spectral radiosity in wavelength is the watt per square metre per metre (W·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;)—commonly the watt per square metre per nanometre ({{nobreak|W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·nm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}). The [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS unit]] [[erg]] per square centimeter per second ({{nobreak|erg·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is often used in [[astronomy]]. Radiosity is often called &quot;intensity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gan, Guohui, Numerical Method for a Full Assessment of Indoor Thermal Confort, Indoor Air Journal, 1994,4:154-158&lt;/ref&gt; in branches of physics other than radiometry, but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with [[radiant intensity]].

==Mathematical definitions==
===Radiosity===
'''Radiosity''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with [[Photometry|photometric]] quantities), is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16943|title=Thermal insulation — Heat transfer by radiation — Physical quantities and definitions|work=ISO 9288:1989|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] catalogue|year=1989|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_\mathrm{e} = \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial A} = J_\mathrm{e,em} + J_\mathrm{e,r} + J_\mathrm{e,tr},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*∂ is the [[partial derivative]] symbol;
*Φ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the radiant flux ''leaving'' (emitted, reflected and transmitted);
*''A'' is the area;
*''J''&lt;sub&gt;e,em&lt;/sub&gt; = ''M''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''emitted'' component of the radiosity of the surface, that is to say its [[exitance]];
*''J''&lt;sub&gt;e,r&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''reflected'' component of the radiosity of the surface;
*''J''&lt;sub&gt;e,tr&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''transmitted'' component of the radiosity of the surface.

For an ''[[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]'' surface, the ''transmitted'' component of radiosity ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e,tr&lt;/sub&gt; vanishes and only two components remain:
:&lt;math&gt;J_\mathrm{e} = M_\mathrm{e} + J_\mathrm{e,r}.&lt;/math&gt;
In [[heat transfer]], combining these two factors into one radiosity term helps in determining the net energy exchange between multiple surfaces.

===Spectral radiosity===
'''Spectral radiosity in frequency''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e,ν&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_{\mathrm{e},\nu} = \frac{\partial J_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \nu},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ν'' is the frequency.

'''Spectral radiosisty in wavelength''' of a ''surface'', denoted ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e,λ&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_{\mathrm{e},\lambda} = \frac{\partial J_\mathrm{e}}{\partial \lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' is the wavelength.

==Radiosity method==
[[File:Radiosity23.png|thumb|400px|right|The two radiosity components of an opaque surface.]]

The radiosity of an ''opaque'', [[Gray body|gray]] and [[Diffuse reflection|diffuse]] surface is given by
:&lt;math&gt;J_\mathrm{e} = M_\mathrm{e} + J_\mathrm{e,r} = \varepsilon \sigma T^4 + (1 - \varepsilon) E_\mathrm{e},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''ε'' is the [[emissivity]] of that surface;
*σ is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]];
*''T'' is the temperature of that surface;
*''E''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[irradiance]] of that surface.

Normally, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the unknown variable and will depend on the surrounding surfaces. So, if some surface ''i'' is being hit by [[radiation]] from some other surface ''j'', then the radiation energy incident on surface ''i'' is ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e,''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e,''j''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''[[view factor]]'' or ''shape factor'', from surface ''j'' to surface ''i''. So, the [[irradiance]] of surface ''i'' is the sum of radiation energy from all other surfaces per unit surface of area ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{e},i} = \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^N F_{ji}A_j J_{\mathrm{e},j}}{A_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, employing the [[View factor#Reciprocity|reciprocity]] relation for view factors ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{e},i} = \sum_{j = 1}^N F_{ij} J_{\mathrm{e},j},&lt;/math&gt;
and substituting the irradiance into the equation for radiosity, produces
:&lt;math&gt;J_{\mathrm{e},i} = \varepsilon_i \sigma T_i^4 + (1 - \varepsilon_i)\sum_{j = 1}^N F_{ij} J_{\mathrm{e},j}.&lt;/math&gt;

For an ''N'' surface enclosure, this summation for each surface will generate ''N'' [[linear equation]]s with ''N'' unknown radiosities,&lt;ref name=sparrow&gt;[[Ephraim M. Sparrow|E.M. Sparrow]] and [[Robert D. Cess|R.D. Cess]]. ''Radiation Heat Transfer.'' Hemisphere Publishing Corporation, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''N'' unknown temperatures. For an enclosure with only a few surfaces, this can be done by hand. But, for a room with many surfaces, [[linear algebra]] and a computer are necessary.

Once the radiosities have been calculated, the net heat transfer at a surface can be determined by finding the difference between the incoming and outgoing energy:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot Q_i = A_i(J_{\mathrm{e},i} - E_{\mathrm{e},i}).&lt;/math&gt;

Using the equation for radiosity ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e,''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;σ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + (1 − ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)''E''&lt;sub&gt;e,''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the irradiance can be eliminated from the above to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\dot Q_i = \frac{A_i \varepsilon_i}{1 - \varepsilon_i}(\sigma T_i^4 - J_{\mathrm{e},i}) = \frac{A_i \varepsilon_i}{1 - \varepsilon_i}(M_{\mathrm{e},i}^\circ - J_{\mathrm{e},i}),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''M''&lt;sub&gt;e,''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; is the exitance of a [[blackbody]].

==Circuit analogy==
For an enclosure consisting of only a few surfaces, it is often easier to represent the system with an analogous [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|circuit]] rather than solve the set of [[Linear equation|linear]] radiosity equations. To do this, the heat transfer at each surface is expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q_i} = \frac{M_{\mathrm{e},i}^\circ - J_{\mathrm{e},i}}{R_i},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = (1 − ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)/(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[Thermal conductivity#Resistance|resistance]] of the surface.

Likewise, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;e,''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; − ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e,''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the blackbody exitance minus the radiosity and serves as the 'potential difference'. These quantities are formulated to resemble those from an [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|electrical circuit]] ''V'' = ''IR''.

Now performing a similar analysis for the heat transfer from surface ''i'' to surface ''j'',
:&lt;math&gt;\dot Q_{ij} = A_i F_{ij} (J_{\mathrm{e},i} - J_{\mathrm{e},j}) = \frac{J_{\mathrm{e},i} - J_{\mathrm{e},j}}{R_{ij}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;).

Because the above is ''between'' surfaces, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is the resistance of the space between the surfaces and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e,''i''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e,''j''&lt;/sub&gt; serves as the potential difference.

Combining the surface elements and space elements, a circuit is formed. The heat transfer is found by using the appropriate potential difference and [[Resistor#Series and parallel resistors|equivalent resistances]], similar to the process used in analyzing [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|electrical circuits]].

==Other methods==
In the radiosity method and circuit analogy, several assumptions were made to simplify the model. The most significant is that the surface is a diffuse emitter. In such a case, the radiosity does not depend on the angle of incidence of reflecting radiation and this information is lost on a [[Diffuse reflection|diffuse]] surface. In reality, however, the radiosity will have a [[Specular reflection|specular]] component from the reflected [[radiation]]. So, the heat transfer between two surfaces relies on both the [[view factor]] and the angle of reflected radiation.

It was also assumed that the surface is a gray body, that is to say its emissivity is independent of radiation frequency or wavelength. However, if the range of radiation spectrum is large, this will not be the case. In such an application, the radiosity must be calculated spectrally and then [[Integral|integrated]] over the range of radiation spectrum.

Yet another assumption is that the surface is [[Contour line|isothermal]]. If it is not, then the radiosity will vary as a function of position along the surface. However, this problem is solved by simply subdividing the surface into smaller elements until the desired accuracy is obtained.&lt;ref name=sparrow/&gt;

The '''emissivity''' of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in emitting energy as [[thermal radiation]]. Thermal radiation is light, but for objects near room temperature this light is [[infrared]] and is not visible to human eyes. The thermal radiation from very hot objects (see photograph) is easily visible to the eye. Quantitatively, emissivity is the ratio of the thermal radiation from a surface to the radiation from an [[black body|ideal black surface]] at the same temperature as given by the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]. The ratio varies from 0 to 1. The surface of a black object emits thermal radiation at the rate of approximately 448 watts per square meter at room temperature (25°C, 298.15 K); real objects with emissivities less than 1.0 emit radiation at correspondingly lower rates.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] is that the rate of emission of thermal radiation is ''σT''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''σ''=5.67×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and the temperature ''T'' is in Kelvins.

Emissivities are important in several contexts:
*[[Insulated glazing|insulated windows]]. — Warm surfaces are usually cooled directly by air, but they also cool themselves by emitting thermal radiation. This second cooling mechanism is important for simple glass windows, which have emissivities close to the maximum possible value of 1.0. &quot;Low-E windows&quot; with transparent [[low emissivity|low emissivity coatings]] emit less thermal radiation than ordinary windows.&lt;ref name=roadmap&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Low-E Window R&amp;D Success Story |title=Windows and Building Envelope Research and Development: Roadmap for Emerging Technologies |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=February 2014 |page=5 |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/02/f8/BTO_windows_and_envelope_report_3.pdf#page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In winter, these coatings can halve the rate at which a window loses heat compared to an uncoated glass window.&lt;ref name=Fricke&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of Energy Technology |last1=Fricke |first1=Jochen |last2=Borst |first2=Walter L. |publisher=Wiley-VCH |date=2013 |isbn=978-3527334162 |page=37 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zn1nAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface absorbs sunlight nearly completely, but has a low thermal emissivity so that it loses very little heat. Ordinary black surfaces also absorb sunlight efficiently, but they emit thermal radiation copiously.]]
*[[Solar thermal collector|solar heat collectors]]. — Similarly, solar heat collectors lose heat by emitting thermal radiation. Advanced solar collectors incorporate [[selective surface]]s that have very low emissivities. These collectors waste very little of the solar energy through emission of thermal radiation.&lt;ref name=Fricke1&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of Energy Technology |chapter=9.

*[[Earth's energy budget|planetary temperatures]]. — The planets are solar thermal collectors on a large scale. The temperature of a planet's surface is determined by the balance between the heat absorbed by the planet from sunlight, heat emitted from its core, and thermal radiation emitted back into space. Emissivity of a planet is determined by the nature of its surface and atmosphere.&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate Sensitivity |url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/atmosphericwarming/climatsensitivity.html |publisher=American Chemical Society |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emissivities of common surfaces==
Emissivities ''ε'' can be measured using simple devices such as [[Leslie cube|Leslie's Cube]] in conjunction with a thermal radiation detector such as a [[thermopile]] or a [[bolometer]]. The apparatus compares the thermal radiation from a surface to be tested with the thermal radiation from a nearly ideal, black sample. The detectors are essentially black absorbers with very sensitive thermometers that record the detector's temperature rise when exposed to thermal radiation. For measuring room temperature emissivities, the detectors must absorb thermal radiation completely at infrared [[wavelength]]s near 10×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; meters.&lt;ref&gt;For a truly black object, the spectrum of its thermal radiation peaks at the wavelength given by [[Wien's displacement law|Wien's Law]]: ''λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''=''b''/''T'', where the temperature ''T'' is in degrees Kelvin and the constant ''b''≈2.90×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; meter-degrees. In Kelvins, room temperature is about 293 degrees. Sunlight itself is thermal radiation originating from the hot surface of the sun. The sun's surface temperature of about 5800 degrees Kelvin corresponds well to the peak wavelength of sunlight, which is at the green wavelength of about 0.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; meters. See {{cite book |title=The Earth's Atmosphere: Its Physics and Dynamics |first=Kshudiram |last=Saha |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |date=2008 |isbn=9783540784272 |page=84 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Jlb5PtwpkI8C&amp;pg=PA84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Visible light has a wavelength range of about 0.4 to 0.7×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; meters from violet to deep red.

Emissivity measurements for many surfaces are compiled in many handbooks and texts. Some of these are listed in the following table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thermal Radiative Transfer and Properties |first=M. Quinn |last=Brewster

Notes:
#These emissivities are the &quot;total hemispherical emissivities&quot; from the surfaces. The term emissivity is also used for &quot;directional spectral emissivities&quot; that describe thermal radiation emitted near specific wavelengths and at specific angles to the surface.
#The values of the emissivities apply to materials that are [[optical depth|optically thick]]. This means that the absorptivity at the wavelengths typical of thermal radiation doesn't depend on the thickness of the material. Very thin materials emit less thermal radiation than thicker materials.
#Snow will vary a lot depending on if it is fresh fallen or old dirty snow.

==Emissivity and absorptivity==
{{main|Kirchoff's law of thermal radiation}}
There is a fundamental relationship ([[Gustav Kirchhoff]]'s 1859 law of thermal radiation) that equates the emissivity of a surface with its absorption of incident radiation (the &quot;[[Absorptance#absorptance|absorptivity]]&quot; of a surface). Kirchhoff's Law explains why emissivities cannot exceed 1, since the largest absorptivity - corresponding to complete absorption of all incident light by a truly black object - is also 1.&lt;ref name=Siegel&gt;{{cite book |title=Thermal Radiation Heat Transfer, Fourth Edition |last=Siegel |first=Robert |publisher=CRC Press |date=2001 |isbn=9781560328391 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=O389yQ0-fecC&amp;pg=PA41 |page=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirror-like, metallic surfaces that reflect light well thus have low emissivities, since the reflected light isn't absorbed. A polished silver surface has an emissivity of about 0.02 near room temperature. Black soot absorbs thermal radiation very well; it has an emissivity as large as 0.97, and hence soot is a fair approximation to an ideal black body.&lt;ref name=table&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monarchserver.com/TableofEmissivity.pdf |title=Table of Total Emissivity }} Table of emissivities provided by a company; no source for these data is provided.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evitherm.org/default.asp?ID=216 |title=Influencing factors |publisher=evitherm Society - Virtual Institute for Thermal Metrology |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of bare, polished metals, the appearance of a surface to the eye is not a good guide to emissivities near room temperature. Thus white paint absorbs very little visible light. However, at an infrared wavelength of 10x10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; meters, paint absorbs light very well, and has a high emissivity. Similarly, pure water absorbs very little visible light, but water is nonetheless a strong infrared absorber and has a correspondingly high emissivity.

===Directional spectral emissivity===
In addition to the total hemispherical emissivities compiled in the table above, a more complex &quot;directional spectral emissivity&quot; can also be measured. This emissivity depends upon the wavelength and upon the angle of the outgoing thermal radiation. Kirchhoff's law actually applies exactly to this more complex emissivity: the emissivity for thermal radiation emerging in a particular direction and at a particular wavelength matches the absorptivity for incident light at the same wavelength and angle. The total hemispherical emissivity is a weighted average of this directional spectral emissivity; the average is described by textbooks on &quot;radiative heat transfer&quot;.&lt;ref name=Siegel /&gt;

==Emissivity and emittance==
Emittance (or emissive power) is the total amount of thermal energy emitter per unit area per unit time for all possible wavelengths. Emissivity of a body at a given temperature is the ratio of the total emissive power of a body to the total emissive power of a perfectly black body at that temperature.

The term emissivity is generally used to describe a simple, homogeneous surface such as silver. Similar terms, '''emittance''' and '''thermal emittance''', are used to describe thermal radiation measurements on complex surfaces such as insulation products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ASTM C835 - 06(2013)e1: Standard Test Method for Total Hemispherical Emittance of Surfaces up to 1400°C |url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/C835.htm |accessdate=2014-08-09 |publisher=[[ASTM International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Green Building: Principles and Practices in Residential Construction |first1=Abe |last1=Kruger |first2=Carl |last2=Seville |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=2012 |isbn=9781111135959 |page=198 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_YM6TOKEEwgC&amp;pg=PA198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reflectance''' of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in reflecting [[radiant energy]]. It is the fraction of incident electromagnetic power that is reflected at an interface.

==Reflectivity==
[[File:Fresnel equations - reflectance.svg|thumb|400px|Fresnel reflection coefficients for a boundary surface between air and a variable material in dependence of the complex refractive index and the angle of incidence.]]
{{redirect|Reflectivity|the EM formulation|Fresnel power reflection}}
For homogeneous and semi-infinite (see [[halfspace]]{{dn|date=August 2015}}) materials, reflectivity is the same as reflectance. 
Reflectivity is the square of the magnitude of the [[Fresnel reflection coefficient]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Hecht (2001). Optics (4th ed.). Pearson Education. ISBN 0-8053-8566-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
which is the ratio of the reflected to incident [[electric field]];&lt;ref name=GoldBook&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Reflectance|file=R05235|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
as such the reflection coefficient can be expressed as a [[complex number]] as determined by the [[Fresnel equation]]s for a single layer, whereas the reflectance is always a positive [[real number]].

For layered and finite media, according to the [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]],{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} '''reflectivity''' is distinguished from '''reflectance''' by the fact that reflectivity is a value that applies to ''thick'' reflecting objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;ILV&quot;&gt;[http://www.cie.co.at/index.php/index.php?i_ca_id=306 CIE International Lighting Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; When reflection occurs from thin layers of material, internal reflection effects can cause the reflectance to vary with surface thickness. Reflectivity is the limit value of reflectance as the sample becomes thick; it is the intrinsic reflectance of the surface, hence irrespective of other parameters such as the reflectance of the rear surface. Another way to interpret this is that the reflectance is the fraction of electromagnetic power reflected from a specific sample, while reflectivity is a property of the material itself, which would be measured on a perfect machine if the material filled half of all space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant&quot;&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/081947245X Palmer and Grant, ''The Art of Radiometry'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surface type==
Going back to the fact that reflectance is a directional property, most surfaces can be divided into those that give [[specular reflection]] and those that give [[diffuse reflection]]:
*for specular surfaces, such as glass or polished metal, reflectance will be nearly zero at all angles except at the appropriate reflected angle; that is, reflected radiation will follow a different path from incident radiation for all cases other than radiation normal to the surface;
*for diffuse surfaces, such as matte white paint, reflectance is uniform; radiation is reflected in all angles equally or near-equally. Such surfaces are said to be [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian]].

Most real objects have some mixture of diffuse and specular reflective properties.

==Water reflectance==
[[File:Water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|400px|Reflectance of smooth water at {{nobreak|20°C}} (refractive index 1.333).]]

Reflection occurs when light moves from a medium with one [[index of refraction]] into a second medium with a different index of refraction.

Specular reflection from a body of water is calculated by the [[Fresnel equations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ottav&quot;&gt;Ottaviani, M. and Stamnes, K. and Koskulics, J. and Eide, H. and Long, S.R. and Su, W. and Wiscombe, W., 2008: 'Light Reflection from Water Waves: Suitable Setup for a Polarimetric Investigation under Controlled Laboratory Conditions''. Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, '''25 (5)''', 715--728.&lt;/ref&gt; Fresnel reflection is directional and therefore does not contribute significantly to [[albedo]] which is primarily diffuse reflection.

A real water surface may be wavy. Reflectance assuming a flat surface as given by the [[Fresnel equations]] can be adjusted to account for [[waviness]].

==Grating efficiency==
The generalization of reflectance to a [[diffraction grating]], which disperses light by [[wavelength]], is called '''[[diffraction efficiency]]'''.

==Applications==
Reflectance is an important concept in the fields of [[optics]], [[solar thermal energy]], [[telecommunication]] and [[radar]].

'''Transmittance''' of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in transmitting [[radiant energy]]. It is the fraction of incident electromagnetic power that is transmitted through a sample, in contrast to the [[transmission coefficient]], which is the ratio of the transmitted to incident [[electric field]].&lt;ref name=GoldBook&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Transmittance|file=T06484|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internal transmittance''' refers to energy loss by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], whereas (total) transmittance is that due to absorption, [[scattering]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], etc.

==Mathematical definitions==
===Hemispherical transmittance===
'''Hemispherical transmittance''' of a surface, denoted ''T'', is defined as&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_9288-1989&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16943|title=Thermal insulation — Heat transfer by radiation — Physical quantities and definitions|work=ISO 9288:1989|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] catalogue|year=1989|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beer–Lambert law==
{{main|Beer–Lambert law}}
By definition, transmittance is related to [[optical depth]] and to [[absorbance]] as
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\tau} = 10^{-A},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''τ'' is the optical depth;
*''A'' is the absorbance.

The [[Beer–Lambert law]] states that, for ''N'' attenuating species in the material sample,
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i \int_0^\ell n_i(z)\mathrm{d}z} = 10^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell c_i(z)\mathrm{d}z},&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently that
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \sum_{i = 1}^N \tau_i = \sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i \int_0^\ell n_i(z)\,\mathrm{d}z,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = \sum_{i = 1}^N A_i = \sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell c_i(z)\,\mathrm{d}z,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Cross section (physics)|attenuation cross section]] of the attenuating specie ''i'' in the material sample;
*''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[number density]] of the attenuating specie ''i'' in the material sample;
*''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[molar attenuation coefficient]] of the attenuating specie ''i'' in the material sample;
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[amount concentration]] of the attenuating specie ''i'' in the material sample;
*''ℓ'' is the path length of the beam of light through the material sample.

Attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient are related by
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i = \frac{\mathrm{N_A}}{\ln{10}}\,\sigma_i,&lt;/math&gt;
and number density and amount concentration by
:&lt;math&gt;c_i = \frac{n_i}{\mathrm{N_A}},&lt;/math&gt;
where N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]].

In case of ''uniform'' attenuation, these relations become&lt;ref name=GoldBook&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Beer–Lambert law|file=B00626|accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = e^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i n_i\ell} = 10^{-\sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i c_i\ell},&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \sum_{i = 1}^N \sigma_i n_i\ell,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = \sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i c_i\ell.&lt;/math&gt;

Cases of ''non-uniform'' attenuation occur in [[atmospheric science]] applications and [[radiation shielding]] theory for instance.

[[File:Gyroskop.jpg|thumb|right|This [[gyroscope]] remains upright while spinning due to the conservation of its angular momentum.]]

In [[physics]], '''angular momentum''' (rarely, '''moment of momentum''' or '''rotational momentum''') is the rotational analog of [[linear momentum]]. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]] – the angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external [[torque]].

Angular momentum is related to the [[rotation]] or revolution of [[matter]]. It is often considered to be a measure of the quantity of rotation of a system of matter, taking into account its [[mass]], [[angular velocity|rotations]], [[Motion (physics)|motions]] and [[shape]]. The conservation of angular momentum explains many observed phenomena.  For example, the increase in rotational speed of a spinning [[figure skater]] as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of [[neutron star]]s, the [[falling cat problem]] and [[precession]] can all be explained in terms of angular momentum conservation. It has numerous applications in physics, engineering and everyday life, for instance, the [[gyrocompass]], [[control moment gyroscope]], [[Inertial navigation system|inertial guidance systems]], [[reaction wheel]]s, [[top]]s, [[Flying disc|flying discs or Frisbees]] and [[Earth's rotation]].

=== Definition ===
{{Main|Scalar (physics)|Euclidean vector}}

==== Scalar — angular momentum in two dimensions ====
[[File:Ang mom 2d.png|right|thumb|[[Velocity]] of the [[particle]] ''m'' with respect to the origin ''O'' can be resolved into components parallel to (''v''&lt;sub&gt;//&lt;/sub&gt;) and perpendicular to (''v''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;) the radius vector ''r''. The '''angular momentum''' of ''m'' is proportional to the [[perpendicular component]] ''v''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt; of the velocity, or equivalently, to the perpendicular distance ''r''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt; from the origin.]]

Angular momentum is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity (more precisely, a [[pseudovector]]) that represents the product of a body's [[Moment of inertia|rotational inertia]] and [[Angular velocity|rotational velocity]] about a particular axis. In the simple case of revolution of a [[particle]] in a [[circle]] about a center of rotation, the particle remaining always in the same [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] and having always the same distance from the center, it is sufficient to discard the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] nature of angular momentum, and treat it as a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Thus, where linear momentum is proportional to [[mass]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and [[speed|linear speed]] &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;p = mv,&lt;/math&gt;
angular momentum is proportional to [[moment of inertia]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and [[Angular frequency|angular speed]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Worthington&quot;&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;L = I\omega.&lt;/math&gt;
Unlike mass, which depends only on amount of matter, moment of inertia is also dependent on the position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the matter. Unlike linear speed, which occurs in a straight line, angular speed occurs about a center of rotation.

Because &lt;math&gt;I=r^2m&lt;/math&gt; for a single particle and &lt;math&gt;\omega=v/r&lt;/math&gt; for circular motion, angular momentum can be expanded, &lt;math&gt;L=(r^2m)\left ( \frac{v}{r} \right ) ,&lt;/math&gt; and reduced to,
:&lt;math&gt;L=rmv,&lt;/math&gt;
the product of the [[radius]] of rotation &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and the [[linear momentum]] of the particle &lt;math&gt;p=mv&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in this case is the equivalent [[speed|linear (tangential) speed]] at the radius (&lt;math&gt;=r\omega&lt;/math&gt;).

This simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the component of the motion which is [[perpendicular]] to the [[Position (vector)|radius vector]] is considered. In that case,

:&lt;math&gt;L = rmv_\perp, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_\perp = v\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the perpendicular component of the motion. Expanding, &lt;math&gt;L=rmv\sin{\theta}, &lt;/math&gt; rearranging, &lt;math&gt;L=r\sin{\theta}mv, &lt;/math&gt; and reducing, angular momentum can also be expressed,
:&lt;math&gt;L=r_\perp mv, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;r_\perp = r\sin{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the [[Torque#Moment arm formula|''moment arm'']], a line dropped perpendicularly from the origin onto the path of the particle. It is this definition, {{math|(length of moment arm)×(linear momentum)}} to which the term ''moment of momentum'' refers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dadourian&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Torque animation.gif|frame|right|Relationship between [[force]] ('''F'''), [[torque]] (τ), [[momentum]] ('''p'''), and angular momentum ('''L''') vectors in a rotating system. (r) is the radius.]]

To completely define angular momentum in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]], it is required to know the [[Angular velocity|angle swept out in unit time]], the direction of the axis of rotation, and the sense (right- or left-handed) of the rotation, as well as the [[mass]] involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In [[vector notation]], the angular momentum of a [[Point particle|particle]] in motion about the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin of coordinates]] is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} =  I\boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt; where

::&lt;math&gt;I=r^2m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] for a [[Point particle|point mass]],

::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}=\frac{\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular velocity]] of the particle about the origin,

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Position (vector)|position vector]] of the particle relative to the origin, &lt;math&gt;r=\left\vert\mathbf{r}\right\vert&lt;/math&gt;,

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[velocity|linear velocity]] of the particle relative to the origin,

::and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass]] of the particle.

This can be expanded, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=(r^2m)\left(\frac{\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}}{r^2}\right),&lt;/math&gt; reduced, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = m(\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}),&lt;/math&gt;
and by the rules of [[Vector calculus|vector algebra]] rearranged to the form,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mathbf{L}&amp;=\mathbf{r}\times m\mathbf{v}\\ &amp;= \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which is the [[cross product]] of the position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and the linear momentum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; of the particle. By the definition of the cross product, the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; vector is [[perpendicular]] to both &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;. It is directed along the axis of rotation as indicated by the [[right-hand rule]] – so that the rotation is seen as [[clockwise|counter-clockwise]] from the head of the vector. Conversely, the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; vector defines the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] in which &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; lie.

By defining a [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of the axis of rotation, a [[angular frequency|scalar angular speed]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; results, where
:&lt;math&gt;\omega\mathbf{\hat{u}}=\boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{v_{\perp}}{r},&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;v_{\perp}&lt;/math&gt; is the perpendicular component of the motion, as above.
The two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be given direction:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mathbf{L}&amp;=I\boldsymbol{\omega}\\
&amp;=I\omega\mathbf{\hat{u}}\\
&amp;=(r^2m)\omega\mathbf{\hat{u}}\\
&amp;=rmv_{\perp}\mathbf{\hat{u}}\\
&amp;=r_{\perp}mv\mathbf{\hat{u}},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=rmv\mathbf{\hat{u}}&lt;/math&gt; for circular motion, where all of the motion is perpendicular to the radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Discussion ===
Angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of [[linear momentum]]. Like linear momentum it involves elements of [[mass]] and [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]]. Unlike linear momentum it also involves elements of [[Position (vector)|position]] and [[shape]].

Many problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point in space, be it in actual rotation about it, or simply moving past it, where it is desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the point — can it exert energy upon it or perform work about it? [[Energy]], the ability to do [[Work (physics)|work]], can be stored in matter by setting it in motion — a combination of its [[inertia]] and its displacement. Inertia is measured by its [[mass]], and displacement by its [[velocity]]. Their product,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(\text{amount of inertia}) \times (\text{amount of displacement})&amp;=\text{amount of (inertia·displacement)}\\
\text{mass} \times \text{velocity} &amp;= \text{momentum}\\
m \times v &amp;= p\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the matter's [[momentum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|date=1893|via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring this momentum to a central point introduces a complication: the momentum is not applied to the point directly. For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is, in effect, at the end of a [[lever]] of the same length as the wheel's radius, its momentum turning the lever about the center point. This imaginary lever is known as the ''moment arm''. It has the effect of multiplying the momentum's effort in proportion to its length, an effect known as a [[Moment (physics)|''moment''.]] Hence, the particle's momentum referred to a particular point,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(\text{moment arm}) \times (\text{amount of inertia}) \times (\text{amount of displacement})&amp;=\text{moment of (inertia·displacement)}\\
\text{length} \times \text{mass} \times \text{velocity} &amp;= \text{moment of momentum}\\
r \times m \times v &amp;= L\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the ''angular momentum'', sometimes called, as here, the ''moment of momentum'' of the particle versus that particular center point. The equation &lt;math&gt;L=rmv&lt;/math&gt; combines a moment (a mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; turning moment arm &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) with a linear (straight-line equivalent) speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Linear speed referred to the central point is simply the product of the distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and the angular speed &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; versus the point: &lt;math&gt;v=r\omega,&lt;/math&gt; another moment. Hence, angular momentum contains a double moment: &lt;math&gt;L=rmr\omega.&lt;/math&gt; Simplifying slightly, &lt;math&gt;L=r^2m\omega,&lt;/math&gt; the quantity &lt;math&gt;r^2m&lt;/math&gt; is the particle's [[moment of inertia]], sometimes called the second moment of mass. It is a measure of rotational inertia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Moment of inertia examples.gif|thumb|right|[[Moment of inertia]] (shown here), and therefore angular momentum, is different for every possible configuration of [[mass]] and [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]].]]

Because rotational inertia is a part of angular momentum, it necessarily includes all of the complications of [[moment of inertia]], which is calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the [[Square (algebra)|squares]] of their [[distances]] from the center of rotation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book

For a [[rigid body]], for instance a wheel or an asteroid, the orientation of rotation is simply the position of the [[Rotation around a fixed axis|rotation axis]] versus the matter of the body. It may or may not pass through the [[center of mass]], or it may lie completely outside of the body. For the same body, angular momentum may take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For a collection of objects revolving about a center, for instance all of the bodies of the [[Solar System]], the orientations may be somewhat organized, as is the Solar System, with most of the bodies' axes lying close to the system's axis. Their orientations may also be completely random.

In brief, the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation (the longer the [[Torque#Moment arm formula|moment arm]]), the greater the moment of inertia, and therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given [[angular velocity]]. In many cases the [[moment of inertia]], and hence the angular momentum, can be simplified by,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[radius of gyration]], the distance from the axis at which the entire mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; may be considered as concentrated.
Similarly, for a [[Point particle|point mass]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the [[moment of inertia]] is defined as,
:&lt;math&gt;I=r^2m&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the [[radius]] of the point mass from the center of rotation,
and for any collection of particles &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; as the sum,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i I_i = \sum_i r_i^2m_i&lt;/math&gt;

Angular momentum's dependence on position and shape is reflected in its [[Units of measurement|units]] versus linear momentum: [[SI derived unit|kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s]], [[SI derived unit|N·m·s]]  or [[SI derived unit|J·s]] for angular momentum versus [[SI derived unit|kg·m/s]] or [[SI derived unit|N·s]] for linear momentum. Angular momentum's units can be interpreted as [[torque]]·seconds, [[Work (physics)|work]]·seconds, or [[energy]]·seconds.

==== Angular momentum and torque ====
{{See also|Torque#Definition and relation to angular momentum}}
[[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's Second Law of Motion]] can be expressed mathematically,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;
or [[Force]] = [[mass]] × [[acceleration]]. The rotational equivalent is
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;
or [[torque]] = [[moment of inertia]] × [[angular acceleration]]. Because angular acceleration is the time [[derivative]] of [[angular velocity]], this is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = I\frac{d\boldsymbol{\omega}}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt; Rearranging into a form suitable for [[Integral|integration]], &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{d(I\boldsymbol{\omega})}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}dt = d(I\boldsymbol{\omega}),&lt;/math&gt; and integrating with respect to time,
:&lt;math&gt;\int \boldsymbol{\tau}dt = I\boldsymbol{\omega} + \text{constant}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, a torque acting over time is equivalent to a [[Angular momentum#Vector – angular momentum in three dimensions|change in angular momentum]]. The constant can be interpreted as the initial angular momentum of the body, before the torque began to act. In particular, if torque &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{0},&lt;/math&gt; then angular momentum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{0} + \text{constant}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = I\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;
or Angular momentum = [[moment of inertia]] × [[angular velocity]], and its time [[derivative]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \frac{dI}{dt}\boldsymbol{\omega} + I\frac{d\boldsymbol{\omega}}{dt}. &lt;/math&gt;

Because moment of inertia is constant, &lt;math&gt;\frac{dI}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; is zero, and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = 0 + I\frac{d\boldsymbol{\omega}}{dt},&lt;/math&gt; which, as above, reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the time rate of change of angular momentum is equivalent to [[torque]]. If angular momentum is constant, &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and no torque is applied.

Similarly, a rotational analogy of [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's Second law of Motion]] might be, &quot;A change in angular momentum is proportional to the applied torque and occurs about the same axis as that torque.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crew&quot; /&gt; Since [[Angular momentum#Angular momentum and torque|a torque applied over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum]], then if torque is zero, angular momentum is constant.

The conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing [[Classical central-force problem|''central force motion'']]. If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the ''center'', then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the force is directed along the [[Position (vector)|radius vector]], and none is [[perpendicular]] to the radius. Mathematically, torque &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0}, &lt;/math&gt; because in this case &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; are parallel vectors. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the case with [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] in the [[orbit]]s of [[planet]]s and [[satellite]]s, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]].

For a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the [[Lunar theory|Earth–Moon system]] results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal torque]] the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/313/1524/47

[[File:PrecessionOfATop.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[torque]] caused by the two opposing forces '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and −'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; causes a change in the angular momentum '''L''' in the direction of that torque (since torque is the time derivative of angular momentum). This causes the top to [[precess]].]]

The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an [[Ice skating|ice skater]] as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of [[moment of inertia]] and [[angular velocity]], if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.

The same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object ''n'' times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Angular momentum in orbital mechanics ===

In astrodynamics and [[celestial mechanics]], a ''massless'' (or ''per unit mass'') angular momentum is defined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v}, &lt;/math&gt;
called ''[[Specific relative angular momentum|specific angular momentum]]''. Note that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = m\mathbf{h}.&lt;/math&gt; [[Mass]] is often unimportant in orbital mechanics calculations, because motion is defined by [[gravity]]. The primary body of the system is often so much larger than any bodies in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible gravitational effect on it; it is, in effect, stationary. All bodies are apparently attracted by its gravity in the same way, regardless of mass, and therefore all move approximately the same way under the same conditions.

=== Solid bodies ===
For a continuous mass distribution with [[density]] function ''ρ''('''r'''), a differential [[volume element]] ''dV'' with [[position vector]] '''r''' within the mass has a mass element ''dm'' = ''ρ''('''r''')''dV''. Therefore the [[infinitesimal]] angular momentum of this element is:

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r}\times dm \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{r}\times \rho(\mathbf{r}) dV \mathbf{v} = dV \mathbf{r}\times \rho(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

and [[volume integral|integrating]] this [[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] over the volume of the entire mass gives its total angular momentum:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\int_V dV \mathbf{r}\times \rho(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Collection of particles ===

==== Center of mass ====
[[File:Ang mom vector diagram.png|thumb|The angular momentum of the particles ''i'' is the sum of the cross products '''R''' x ''M'''''V''' + Σ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; x ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

It is convenient to develop the equation of angular momentum for a collection of particles in motion about an arbitrary origin by resolving their motion into components about their own center of mass and about the origin. Given,
: &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of particle &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of particle &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; vs the origin,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of particle &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; vs the origin,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of the center of mass vs the origin,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the center of mass vs the origin,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of particle &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; vs the center of mass,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of particle &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; vs the center of mass,

The total mass of the particles is simply their sum,
:&lt;math&gt;M=\sum_i m_i.&lt;/math&gt;

The position vector of the center of mass is defined by,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The total angular momentum of the collection of particles is the sum of the angular momentum of each particle,

The first term is the angular momentum of the center of mass relative to the origin. Similar to [[Angular momentum#Single particle|'''Single particle''']], below, it is the angular momentum of one particle of mass ''M'' at the center of mass moving with velocity '''V'''. The second term is the angular momentum of the particles moving relative to the center of mass, similar to [[Angular momentum#Fixed center of mass|'''Fixed center of mass''']], below. The result is general — the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the origin or center of mass. The particles need not be individual masses, but can be elements of a continuous distribution, such as a solid body.

Rearranging equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) by vector identities, multiplying both terms by &quot;one&quot;, and grouping appropriately,

&amp;= R^2M \left ( \frac{\mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{V}}{R^2} \right ) + \sum_i \left [ r_i^2m_i \left ( \frac{\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{v}_i}{r_i^2} \right ) \right ] ,\\

gives the total angular momentum of the system of particles in terms of [[moment of inertia]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and [[angular velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;,

== Angular momentum (modern definition) ==
[[File:Angular momentum bivector and pseudovector.svg|275px|thumb|The 3-angular momentum as a [[bivector]] (plane element) and [[axial vector]], of a particle of mass ''m'' with instantaneous 3-position '''x''' and 3-momentum '''p'''.]]

In modern (20th century) theoretical physics, angular momentum (not including any intrinsic angular momentum – see [[#Angular momentum in quantum mechanics|below]]) is described using a different formalism, instead of a classical pseudovector. In this formalism, angular momentum is the [[2-form]] [[Noether charge]] associated with rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general [[curved space]]times, unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted as a plane element:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \wedge \mathbf{p} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

in which the [[exterior product]] ∧ replaces the [[cross product]] × (these products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent). This has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element, defined from the '''x''' and '''p'''  vectors, and the expression is true in any number of dimensions (two or higher). In Cartesian coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rl}\mathbf{L} &amp; =\left(xp_{y}-yp_{x}\right)\mathbf{e}_{x}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{y}+\left(yp_{z}-zp_{y}\right)\mathbf{e}_{y}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{z}+\left(zp_{x}-xp_{z}\right)\mathbf{e}_{z}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{x}\\ &amp; =L_{xy}\mathbf{e}_{x}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{y}+L_{yz}\mathbf{e}_{y}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{z}+L_{zx}\mathbf{e}_{z}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{x} \,, \end{array} &lt;/math&gt;

or more compactly in index notation:

:&lt;math&gt;L_{ij}=x_{i}p_{j}-x_{j}p_{i}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor, with components ''ω&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''. The relation between the two antisymmetric tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order tensor:&lt;ref&gt;Synge and Schild, Tensor calculus, Dover publications, 1978 edition, p. 161.  ISBN 978-0-486-63612-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_{ij} = I_{ijk\ell} \omega_{k\ell} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Again, this equation in '''L''' and '''ω''' as tensors is true in any number of dimensions. This equation also appears in the [[geometric algebra]] formalism, in which '''L''' and '''ω''' are bivectors, and the moment of inertia is a mapping between them.

In [[relativistic mechanics]], the [[relativistic angular momentum]] of a particle is expressed as an [[antisymmetric tensor]] of second order:

:&lt;math&gt; M_{\alpha\beta} = X_\alpha\ P_\beta - X_\beta P_\alpha &lt;/math&gt;

in the language of [[four-vector]]s, namely the [[Four-position|four position]] ''X'' and the [[four momentum]] ''P'', and absorbs the above '''L''' together with the motion of the [[centre of mass]] of the particle.

In each of the above cases, for a system of particles, the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and the centre of mass is for the system.

== Angular momentum in quantum mechanics ==
{{Main|Angular momentum operator}}
Angular momentum in [[quantum mechanics]] differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in [[classical mechanics]]. In [[relativistic quantum mechanics#Relativistic quantum angular momentum|relativistic quantum mechanics]], it differs even more, in which the above relativistic definition becomes a tensorial operator.

=== Spin, orbital, and total angular momentum ===
{{Main|Spin (physics)}}

[[File:Classical angular momentum.svg|350px|thumb|Angular momenta of a ''classical'' object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Left:''' &quot;spin&quot; angular momentum '''S''' is really orbital angular momentum of the object at every point,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''right:''' extrinsic orbital angular momentum '''L''' about an axis,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''top:''' the [[moment of inertia tensor]] '''I''' and [[angular velocity]] '''ω''' ('''L''' is not always parallel to '''ω'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Feynman's Lectures on Physics (volume 2)|author=R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands|publisher=Addison–Wesley|year=1964|pages=31–7|isbn=978-0-201-02117-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''bottom:''' momentum '''p''' and its radial position '''r''' from the axis.&lt;/p&gt; The total angular momentum (spin plus orbital) is '''J'''. For a ''quantum'' particle the interpretations are different; [[spin (physics)|particle spin]] does ''not'' have the above interpretation.]]

The classical definition of angular momentum as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; can be carried over to quantum mechanics, by reinterpreting '''r''' as the quantum [[position operator]] and '''p''' as the quantum [[momentum operator]]. '''L''' is then an [[Operator (physics)|operator]], specifically called the ''[[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum operator]]''.

However, in quantum physics, there is another type of angular momentum, called ''[[spin (physics)|spin angular momentum]]'', represented by the spin operator '''S'''. Almost all [[elementary particle]]s have spin. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum. All [[elementary particles]] have a characteristic spin, for example [[electron]]s always have &quot;spin 1/2&quot; (this actually means &quot;spin [[reduced Planck constant|ħ]]/2&quot;) while [[photon]]s always have &quot;spin 1&quot; (this actually means &quot;spin ħ&quot;).

Finally, there is [[total angular momentum]] '''J''', which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields. (For one particle, '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S'''.) [[Conservation of angular momentum]] applies to '''J''', but not to '''L''' or '''S'''; for example, the [[spin–orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between '''L''' and '''S''', with the total remaining constant.

=== Quantization ===
In [[quantum mechanics]], angular momentum is [[angular momentum quantization|quantized]] – that is, it cannot vary continuously, but only in &quot;[[Quantum number|quantum leaps]]&quot; between certain allowed values. For any system, the following restrictions on measurement results apply, where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; is any [[direction vector]] such as x, y, or z:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|'''If you [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measure]]...'''
|'''The result can be...'''
|-
|&lt;math&gt;L_{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\ldots, -2\hbar, -\hbar, 0, \hbar, 2\hbar, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;S_{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;J_{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\ldots, -\frac{3}{2}\hbar, -\hbar, -\frac{1}{2}\hbar, 0, \frac{1}{2}\hbar, \hbar, \frac{3}{2}\hbar, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt; (&lt;math&gt;= L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2&lt;/math&gt;)
|&lt;math&gt;(\hbar^2 n(n+1))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n=0,1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;J^2&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;(\hbar^2 n(n+1))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n=0,\frac{1}{2},1,\frac{3}{2}, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
|}
[[File:Circular Standing Wave.gif|thumb|right|In this [[standing wave]] on a circular string, the circle is broken into exactly 8 [[wavelength]]s. A standing wave like this can have 0,1,2, or any integer number of wavelengths around the circle, but it ''cannot'' have a non-integer number of wavelengths like 8.3. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason.]]
(There are additional restrictions as well, see [[angular momentum operator]] for details.)

The [[reduced Planck constant]] &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is tiny by everyday standards, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; [[Joule-second|J s]], and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the structure of [[electron shell]]s and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.

Quantization of angular momentum was first postulated by [[Niels Bohr]] in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom and was later predicted by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in his [[Schrödinger equation#Quantization|Schrödinger equation]].

=== Uncertainty ===
In the definition &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;, six operators are involved: The [[position operator]]s &lt;math&gt;r_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r_y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r_z&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[momentum operator]]s &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_z&lt;/math&gt;. However, the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] and its component along one axis.

The uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an [[angular momentum operator]] do not [[commutator|commute]], for example &lt;math&gt;L_xL_y \neq L_yL_x&lt;/math&gt;. (For the precise [[commutation relation]]s, see [[angular momentum operator]].)

=== Total angular momentum as generator of rotations ===
As mentioned above, orbital angular momentum '''L''' is defined as in classical mechanics: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;, but ''total'' angular momentum '''J''' is defined in a different, more basic way: '''J''' is defined as the &quot;generator of rotations&quot;.&lt;ref name=littlejohn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1011/notes/spinrot.pdf|title= Lecture notes on rotations in quantum mechanics|first= Robert |last=Littlejohn|accessdate= 13 Jan 2012|work=Physics 221B Spring 2011|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, '''J''' is defined so that the operator
:&lt;math&gt;R(\hat{n},\phi) \equiv \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\phi\, \mathbf{J}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]] that takes any system and rotates it by angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; about the axis &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. (The &quot;exp&quot; in the formula refers to [[matrix exponential|operator exponential]])

The relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between [[lie algebra]]s and [[lie group]]s in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in [[Noether's theorem]] that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant.

== Angular momentum in electrodynamics ==
{{See also|Momentum#Particle in field|l1=Momentum (Particle in field)}}

When describing the motion of a [[charged particle]] in an [[electromagnetic field]], the [[canonical momentum]] '''P''' (derived from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for this system) is not [[gauge invariant]]. As a consequence, the canonical angular momentum '''L''' = '''r''' × '''P''' is not gauge invariant either. Instead, the momentum that is physical, the so-called ''kinetic momentum'' (used throughout this article), is (in [[SI units]])

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{P} - e \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the [[electric charge]] of the particle and '''A''' the [[magnetic vector potential]] of the electromagnetic field. The [[Gauge theory|gauge-invariant]] angular momentum, that is ''kinetic angular momentum'', is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}= \mathbf{r} \times ( \mathbf{P} - e\mathbf{A} )&lt;/math&gt;

The interplay with quantum mechanics is discussed further in the article on [[canonical commutation relation]]s.

== History ==
[[Isaac Newton|Newton]], in the [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|''Principia'']], hinted at angular momentum in his examples of the [[Newton's laws of motion|First Law of Motion]],
:''A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is retarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions both progressive and circular for a much longer time.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last1 = Newton
|first1 = Isaac
|title = The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy
|publisher = H. D. Symonds, London
|others=Andrew Motte, translator
|date=1803
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exwAAAAAQAAJ|chapter=Axioms; or Laws of Motion, Law I|via=Google books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He did not further investigate angular momentum directly in the ''Principia'',
:''From such kind of reflexions also sometimes arise the circular motions of bodies about their own centres. But these are cases which I do not consider in what follows; and it would be too tedious to demostrate every particular that relates to this subject.''&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Axioms; or Laws of Motion, Corollary III&lt;/ref&gt;
However, his geometric proof of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Law of Areas]] is an outstanding example of Newton's genius, and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in the case of a [[central force]].

=== The Law of Areas ===
{{Main|Classical central-force problem|Areal velocity}}

==== Newton's derivation ====
[[File:Newton area law derivation.gif|frame|right|Newton's derivation of the area law using geometric means.]]

As a [[planet]] orbits the [[Sun]], the line between the Sun and the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. This had been known since [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] expounded his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Second Law of Planetary Motion]]. Newton derived a unique geometric proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of the Sun's [[gravity]] was the cause of all of Kepler's laws.

During the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point '''A''' to point '''B'''. Undisturbed, it would continue to point '''c''' during the second interval. When the object arrives at '''B''', it receives an impulse directed toward point '''S'''. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward '''S''', such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from '''B''' to '''V''' during the second interval. By the [[Parallelogram of force|rules of velocity composition]], these two velocities add, and point '''C''' is found by construction of parallelogram '''BcCV'''. Thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point '''C''' at the end of the second interval. Because the triangles '''SBc''' and '''SBC''' have the same base '''SB''' and the same height '''Bc''' or '''VC''', they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle '''SBc''' also has the same area as triangle '''SAB''', therefore the object has swept out equal areas '''SAB''' and '''SBC''' in equal times.

At point '''C''', the object receives another impulse toward '''S''', again deflecting its path during the third interval from '''d''' to '''D'''. Thus it continues to '''E''' and beyond, the triangles '''SAB''', '''SBc''', '''SBC''', '''SCd''', '''SCD''', '''SDe''', '''SDE''' all having the same area. Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path '''ABCDE''' approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve.

Note that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler's Second Law of Planetary Motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force, attractive or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.

==== Conservation of angular momentum in the Law of Areas ====
The proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is, the lines from '''S''' to the object, are equivalent to the [[Angular momentum#Scalar – angular momentum in two dimensions|radius {{math|&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;}}]], and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of [[Angular momentum#Scalar – angular momentum in two dimensions|velocity {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the triangular area formula {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(base)(height)}}, the product {{math|(base)(height)}} and therefore the product {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;rv&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;}} are constant: if {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;}} and the base length are decreased, {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;}} and height must increase proportionally. Mass is constant, therefore [[Angular momentum#Scalar – angular momentum in two dimensions|angular momentum {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;rmv&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;}}]] is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocity.

In the case of triangle '''SBC''', area is equal to {{sfrac|1|2}}('''SB''')('''VC'''). Wherever '''C''' is eventually located due to the impulse applied at '''B''', the product ('''SB''')('''VC'''), and therefore {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;rmv&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt;}} remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.

=== After Newton ===
[[Leonhard Euler]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and [[Patrick d'Arcy]] all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of [[areal velocity]], a result of their analysis of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Kepler's Second Law]] of planetary motion. It is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.&lt;ref&gt;see {{cite web

|last=Borrelli
|first=Arianna
|date=2011
|title=Angular momentum between physics and mathematics}} for an excellent and detailed summary of the concept of angular momentum through history.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1736 Euler, like Newton, touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his ''[[Mechanica]]'' without further developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/mechanica1.html
|title=Euler : Mechanica Vol. 1
|last=Bruce
|first=Ian
|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a &quot;moment of rotational motion&quot;, possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://eulerarchive.maa.org/correspondence/letters/OO0153.pdf
|title=Euler's Correspondence with Daniel Bernoulli, Bernoulli to Euler, 04 February, 1744}}, at [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/ The Euler Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1799, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation — his ''[[invariable plane]]''.

[[Louis Poinsot]] in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation, and elaborated on the &quot;conservation of moments&quot;.

In 1852 [[Léon Foucault]] used a [[gyroscope]] in an experiment to display the Earth's rotation.

[[William John Macquorn Rankine|William J. M. Rankine's]] 1858 ''Manual of Applied Mechanics'' defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first time:
:''...a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the angular momentum, and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the body and of the fixed point, and such, that when the motion of the body is viewed from the extremity of the line, the radius-vector of the body seems to have right-handed rotation.''

In an 1872 edition of the same book, Rankine stated that &quot;The term ''angular momentum'' was introduced by Mr. Hayward,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last1 = Rankine

Hayward's article ''On a Direct Method of estimating Velocities, Accelerations, and all similar Quantities with respect to Axes moveable in any manner in Space with Applications,''&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayward&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Rankine was mistaken, as numerous publications feature the term starting in the late 18th to early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;see, for instance, {{cite journal
|last1 = Gompertz

Before this, angular momentum was typically referred to as &quot;momentum of rotation&quot; in English.&lt;ref&gt;see, for instance, {{cite journal

V. Gupta, ''Units of Measurement: Past, Present and Future. International System of Units'', p. 16, Springer, 2009 ISBN 3-642-00738-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14 parts of ISO/IEC 80000 define quantities used in scientific disciplines such as mechanics, light, acoustics (e.g., [[sound pressure]] and [[sound intensity]]), electromagnetism, information technology (e.g., [[traffic intensity]] and [[storage capacity]]), chemistry, mathematics, and physiology.

==Base quantities==
A base quantity is a [[physical quantity]] in a subset of a given system of quantities that is chosen by convention, where no quantity in the set can be expressed in terms of the others. The ISQ defines seven base quantities.

The [[dimension of a physical quantity]] does not include magnitude or units. The conventional symbolic representation of the dimension of a base quantity is a single upper-case letter in [[roman (typeface)|roman]] (upright) [[sans-serif]]&lt;ref&gt;The status of the requirement for sans-serif is not as clear, since [[ISO 80000-1|ISO 80000-1:2009]] makes no mention of it (&quot;The conventional symbolic representation of the dimension of a base quantity is a single upper case letter in roman (upright) type.&quot;) whereas the secondary source BIPM JCGM 200:2012 does (&quot;The conventional symbolic representation of the dimension of a base quantity is a single upper case letter in roman (upright) sans-serif type.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; type.

==Derived quantities==

A derived quantity is a quantity in a system of quantities that is a defined in terms of the base quantities of that system. The ISQ defines many derived quantities.

===Dimensions of derived quantities===
The conventional symbolic representation of the dimension of a derived quantity is the product of powers of the dimensions of the base quantities according to the definition of the derived quantity. The dimension of a quantity is denoted by L&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;Θ&lt;sup&gt;''e''&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt;J&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;, where the exponents, named dimensional exponents, are positive, negative, or zero. The symbol may be omitted if its exponent is zero. For example, in the ISQ, the quantity dimension of velocity is denoted LT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The following table lists some quantities defined by the ISQ.

A ''quantity of dimension one'' is historically known as a ''dimensionless quantity'' (a term that is still commonly used), all its dimensional exponents are zero and its dimension symbol is 1. Such a quantity can be regarded as a derived quantity in the form of the ratio of two quantities of the same dimension.

===Logarithmic quantities===
In the ISQ, the [[level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] of a quantity ''Q'' is defined as log&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Q''/''Q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''r'' is a specified base and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a specified reference value of the quantity. An example of level is [[sound pressure level]]. All levels of the ISQ are derived quantities.

{{for|the curvature form|Field strength (theoretical physics)}}

In [[physics]], '''field strength''' or '''intensity''' means the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of a [[vector (geometry)|vector]]-valued [[field (physics)|field]]. 
For example, [[electromagnetic field]] results in both [[electric field strength]] and [[magnetic field strength]].
As an application, in [[radio frequency]] [[telecommunications]], the '''[[signal strength]]''' excites a receiving antenna and thereby induce a voltage at a specific frequency and polarization in order to provide an input signal to a radio receiver. [[Field strength meter]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are used for such applications as cellular, broadcasting, wi-fi and a wide variety of other radio-related applications.
&lt;!--
Magnetic Field intensity is expressed as H; its usual unit is amperes/meter, A/m, A-turn/m, A-t/m.
Magnetic field intensity is equal TO B/u, Where 'B' is magnetic flux density and 'u' is permeability of the medium.---&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38912">{{For|thermal conductivity values|List of thermal conductivities}}

In [[physics]], '''thermal conductivity''' (often denoted ''k'', ''λ'', or ''κ'') is the [[List of materials properties|property]] of a material to [[heat conduction|conduct heat]]. It is evaluated primarily in terms of [[Heat conduction#Fourier's law|Fourier's Law]] for [[heat conduction]].

Heat transfer occurs at a lower rate across materials of low thermal conductivity than across materials of high thermal conductivity. Correspondingly, materials of high thermal conductivity are widely used in [[heat sink]] applications and materials of low thermal conductivity are used as [[thermal insulation]]. The thermal conductivity of a material may depend on temperature. The reciprocal of thermal conductivity is called thermal resistivity.

Thermal conductivity is actually a [[tensor]], which means it is possible to have different values in different directions. See [[#Thermal anisotropy]] below.

== Units of thermal conductivity ==
In [[International System of Units|SI units]], thermal conductivity is measured in watts per meter kelvin ([[Watt|W]]/([[metre|m]]·[[Kelvin|K]])). 
The [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] of thermal conductivity is M&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;Θ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. These variables are (M)mass, (L)length, (T)time, and (Θ)temperature.
In [[Imperial units]], thermal conductivity is measured in [[British thermal unit|BTU]]/([[hour|hr]]·[[foot (unit)|ft]]⋅[[Fahrenheit|°F]]).&lt;ref group=note&gt;1 Btu/(hr·ft⋅F) = 1.730735 W/(m·K)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other units which are closely related to the thermal conductivity are in common use in the construction and textile industries.  The construction industry makes use of units such as the [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] (resistance) and the [[R-value (insulation)#U-factor|U-value]] (conductivity).  Although related to the thermal conductivity of a material used in an insulation product, R and U-values are dependent on the thickness of the product.&lt;ref group=note&gt;R-Values and U-Values quoted in the US (based on the imperial units of measurement) do not correspond with and are not compatible with those used outside the US (based on the SI units of measurement).&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise the textile industry has several units including the [[Tog (unit)|tog]] and the [[Thermal Comfort|clo]] which express thermal resistance of a material in a way analogous to the R-values used in the construction industry.

== Measurement ==
{{main|Thermal conductivity measurement}}

There are a number of ways to measure thermal conductivity.   Each of these is suitable for a limited range of materials, depending on the thermal properties and the medium temperature.   There is a distinction between steady-state and transient techniques.

In general, steady-state techniques are useful when the temperature of the material does not change with time. This makes the signal analysis straightforward (steady state implies constant signals). The disadvantage is that a well-engineered experimental setup is usually needed. The Divided Bar (various types) is the most common device used for consolidated rock solids.

== Experimental values ==
[[File:Thermal conductivity.svg|thumb|550px|Experimental values of thermal conductivity.]]
{{main|List of thermal conductivities}}
Thermal conductivity is important in material science, research, electronics, [[building insulation]] and related fields, especially where high operating temperatures are achieved. Several materials are shown in the [[list of thermal conductivities]]. These should be considered approximate due to the uncertainties related to material definitions.

High energy generation rates within [[computer cooling|electronics]] or [[Turbine blade#Cooling|turbines]] require the use of materials with high thermal conductivity such as [[Copper in heat exchangers|copper]] ''(see: [[Copper in heat exchangers]])'', [[aluminium]], and [[silver]]. On the other hand, materials with low thermal conductance, such as [[polystyrene]] and [[alumina]], are used in  building [[construction]] or in [[furnaces]] in an effort to slow the flow of heat, i.e. for insulation purposes.

== Definitions ==

The reciprocal of thermal conductivity is ''thermal resistivity'', usually expressed in kelvin-meters per watt (K·m·W&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). For a given thickness of a material, that particular construction's  ''thermal resistance'' and the reciprocal property, ''thermal conductance'', can be calculated. Unfortunately, there are differing definitions for these terms.

Thermal conductivity, ''k'', often depends on temperature. Therefore the definitions listed below make sense when the thermal conductivity is temperature independent. Otherwise an representative mean value has to be considered; for more, see the [[Thermal Conductivity#Equations|equations]] section below.

=== Conductance ===

For general scientific use, ''thermal conductance'' is the quantity of heat that passes in unit time through a plate of ''particular area and thickness'' when its opposite faces differ in temperature by one kelvin. For a plate of thermal conductivity ''k'', area ''A'' and thickness ''L'', the conductance calculated is ''kA/L'', measured in W·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (equivalent to: W/°C).  The thermal conductance of that particular construction is the inverse of the thermal resistance. Thermal conductivity and conductance are [[analogy|analogous]] to [[electrical conductivity]] (A·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·V&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[electrical conductance]] (A·V&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

There is also a measure known as [[heat transfer coefficient]]: the quantity of heat that passes in unit time through a ''unit area'' of a plate of particular thickness when its opposite faces differ in temperature by one kelvin. The reciprocal is ''thermal insulance''. In summary:
* thermal conductance = ''kA''/''L'', measured in W·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
** thermal resistance = ''L''/(''kA''), measured in K·W&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (equivalent to: °C/W)
* heat transfer coefficient = ''k''/''L'', measured in W·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
** thermal insulance = ''L''/''k'', measured in K·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·W&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The heat transfer coefficient is also known as ''thermal admittance'' in the sense that the material may be seen as admitting heat to flow.

=== Resistance ===
{{Main|Thermal resistance}}
Thermal resistance is the ability of a material to resist the flow of heat.

Thermal resistance is the reciprocal of thermal conductance, i.e., lowering its value will raise the heat conduction and vice versa.

When thermal resistances occur in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]], they are ''additive''. Thus, when heat flows consecutively through two components each with a resistance of 3&amp;nbsp;°C/W, the total resistance is 3+3=6&amp;nbsp;°C/W.

A common engineering design problem involves the selection of an appropriate sized [[heat sink]] for a given heat source.  Working in units of thermal resistance greatly simplifies the design calculation.  The following formula can be used to estimate the performance:
:&lt;math&gt;R_{hs} = \frac {\Delta T}{P_{th}} - R_s &lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- Rhs = delta T / P_th - Rs  --&gt;
where:
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;hs&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum thermal resistance of the heat sink to ambient, in °C/W (equivalent to K/W)
* Δ''T'' is the required temperature difference (temperature drop), in °C
* ''P''&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; is the thermal power (heat flow), in watts
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the thermal resistance of the heat source, in °C/W

For example, if a component produces 100 W of heat, and has a thermal resistance of 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C/W, what is the maximum thermal resistance of the heat sink?  Suppose the maximum temperature is 125&amp;nbsp;°C, and the ambient temperature is 25&amp;nbsp;°C; then Δ''T'' is 100&amp;nbsp;°C.  The heat sink's thermal resistance to ambient must then be 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C/W or less (total resistance component and heat sink is then 1.0&amp;nbsp;°C/W).

=== Transmittance ===

A third term, ''[[thermal transmittance]]'', quantifies the thermal conductance of a structure along with heat transfer due to [[convection]] and [[thermal radiation|radiation]]. It is measured in the same units as thermal conductance and is sometimes known as the ''composite thermal conductance''. The term ''[[U-value]]'' is often used.

=== Admittance ===
The thermal admittance of a material, such as a building fabric, is a measure of the ability of a material to transfer heat in the presence of a temperature difference on opposite sides of the material. Thermal admittance is measured in the same units as a heat transfer coefficient, power (watts) per unit area (square meters) per temperature change (kelvin). Thermal admittance of a building fabric affects a building's thermal response to variation in outside temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermal Mass in Buildings|url=http://www.reidsteel.com/thermal-mass-in-buildings.htm|publisher=Reidsteel|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influencing factors ==

=== Temperature ===

The effect of temperature on thermal conductivity is different for metals and nonmetals. In metals conductivity is primarily due to free electrons. Following the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]], thermal conductivity of metals is approximately proportional to the absolute temperature (in [[kelvin]]) times electrical conductivity.  In pure metals the electrical conductivity decreases with increasing temperature and thus the product of the two, the thermal conductivity, stays approximately constant. In alloys the change in electrical conductivity is usually smaller and thus thermal conductivity increases with temperature, often proportionally to temperature.

On the other hand, heat conductivity in nonmetals is mainly due to lattice vibrations ([[phonon]]s). Except for high quality crystals at low temperatures, the phonon mean free path is not reduced significantly at higher temperatures. Thus, the thermal conductivity of nonmetals is approximately constant at high temperatures. At low temperatures well below the [[Debye model#Debye temperature table|Debye temperature]], thermal conductivity decreases, as does the heat capacity.

=== Chemical phase ===

When a material undergoes a phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas the thermal conductivity may change.  An example of this would be the change in thermal conductivity that occurs when ice (thermal conductivity of 2.18 W/(m·K) at 0&amp;nbsp;°C) melts to form liquid water (thermal conductivity of 0.56 W/(m·K) at 0&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nist.gov/data/PDFfiles/jpcrd493.pdf NIST: Standard reference data for the thermal conductivity of water]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermal anisotropy ===

Some substances, such as non-[[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] [[crystal]]s, can exhibit different thermal conductivities along different crystal axes, due to differences in [[phonon]] coupling along a given crystal axis. [[Sapphire]] is a notable example of variable thermal conductivity based on orientation and temperature, with 35 W/(m·K) along the C-axis and 32 W/(m·K) along the A-axis.&lt;ref&gt;

 |accessdate=2012-08-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Wood]] generally conducts better along the grain than across it.

When anisotropy is present, the direction of heat flow may not be exactly the same as the direction of the thermal gradient.

=== Electrical conductivity ===

In metals, thermal conductivity approximately tracks electrical conductivity according to the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]], as freely moving [[valence electron]]s transfer not only electric current but also heat energy.  However, the general correlation between electrical and thermal conductance does not hold for other materials, due to the increased importance of [[phonon]] carriers for heat in non-metals. Highly electrically conductive [[silver]] is less thermally conductive than [[diamond]], which is an [[electrical insulator]], but due to its orderly array of atoms it is conductive of heat via phonons.

=== Magnetic field ===
The influence of magnetic fields on thermal conductivity is known as the [[Righi-Leduc effect]].

=== Convection ===
[[File:Coloured ceramic thermal barrier coating on exhaust component.jpg|thumb|Ceramic coatings with low thermal conductivities are used on exhaust systems to prevent heat from reaching sensitive components]]

Air and other gases are generally good insulators, in the absence of convection.  Therefore, many insulating materials function simply by having a large number of gas-filled pockets which prevent large-scale convection.  Examples of these include expanded and extruded [[polystyrene]] (popularly referred to as &quot;styrofoam&quot;) and silica [[aerogel]], as well as warm clothes.  Natural, biological insulators such as fur and [[feathers]] achieve similar effects by dramatically inhibiting convection of air or water near an animal's skin.

Light gases, such as [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] typically have high thermal conductivity.  Dense gases such as [[xenon]] and [[dichlorodifluoromethane]] have low thermal conductivity.  An exception, [[sulfur hexafluoride]], a dense gas, has a relatively high thermal conductivity due to its high [[heat capacity]].  [[Argon]], a gas denser than air, is often used in [[insulated glazing]] (double paned windows) to improve their insulation characteristics.

== Physical origins ==

Heat flux is exceedingly difficult to control and isolate in a laboratory setting. At the atomic level, there are no simple, correct expressions for thermal conductivity. Atomically, the thermal conductivity of a system is determined by how atoms composing the system interact. There are two different approaches for calculating the thermal conductivity of a system.

* The first approach employs the [[Green-Kubo relations]].  Although this employs analytic expressions, which, in principle, can be solved, calculating the thermal conductivity of a dense fluid or solid using this relation requires the use of molecular dynamics computer [http://rsc.anu.edu.au/~evans/evansmorrissbook.htm simulation].

* The second approach is based on the relaxation time approach.  Due to the anharmonicity within the crystal potential, the phonons in the system are known to scatter.  There are three main mechanisms for scattering:
** Boundary scattering, a phonon hitting the boundary of a system;
** Mass defect scattering, a phonon hitting an impurity within the system and scattering;
** Phonon-phonon scattering, a phonon breaking into two lower energy phonons or a phonon colliding with another phonon and merging into one higher-energy  phonon.

=== Lattice waves ===

Heat transport in both amorphous and crystalline [[dielectric]] solids is by way of elastic vibrations of the lattice ([[phonon]]s). This transport mode is limited by the elastic scattering of acoustic phonons at lattice defects. These predictions were confirmed by the experiments of Chang and Jones on commercial glasses and glass ceramics, where the mean free paths were limited by &quot;internal boundary scattering&quot; to length scales of 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm to 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=&quot;PGK&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phonon mean free path has been associated directly with the effective relaxation length for processes without directional correlation. If V&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; is the group velocity of a phonon wave packet, then the relaxation length &lt;math&gt;l\;&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;l\;=V_g t&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the characteristic relaxation time. Since longitudinal waves have a much greater phase velocity than transverse waves, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;long&lt;/sub&gt; is much greater than ''V''&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt;, and the relaxation length or mean free path of longitudinal phonons will be much greater. Thus, thermal conductivity will be largely determined by the speed of longitudinal phonons.&lt;ref name=&quot;PGK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the dependence of wave velocity on wavelength or frequency ([[Acoustic dispersion|dispersion]]), low-frequency phonons of long wavelength will be limited in relaxation length by elastic [[Rayleigh scattering]]. This type of light scattering from small particles is proportional to the fourth power of the frequency. For higher frequencies, the power of the frequency will decrease until at highest frequencies scattering is almost frequency independent. Similar arguments were subsequently generalized to many glass forming substances using [[Brillouin scattering]].&lt;ref&gt;

Phonons in the acoustical branch dominate the phonon heat conduction as they have greater energy dispersion and therefore a greater distribution of phonon velocities. Additional optical modes could also be caused by the presence of internal structure (i.e., charge or mass) at a lattice point; it is implied that the group velocity of these modes is low and therefore their contribution to the lattice thermal conductivity λ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\kappa &lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) is small.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banduru&quot;&gt;

Each phonon mode can be split into one longitudinal and two transverse polarization branches. By extrapolating the phenomenology of lattice points to the unit cells it is seen that the total number of degrees of freedom is 3pq when p is the number of primitive cells with q atoms/unit cell. From these only 3p are associated with the acoustic modes, the remaining 3p(q-1) are accommodated through the optical branches. This implies that structures with larger p and q contain a greater number of optical modes and a reduced λ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

From these ideas, it can be concluded that increasing crystal complexity, which is described by a complexity factor CF (defined as the number of atoms/primitive unit cell), decreases λ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Micheline Roufosse and P.G. Klemens derived the exact proportionality in their article Thermal Conductivity of Complex Dielectric Crystals at Phys. Rev. B 7, 5379–5386 (1973). This was done by assuming that the relaxation time τ decreases with increasing number of atoms in the unit cell and then scaling the parameters of the expression for thermal conductivity in high temperatures accordingly.&lt;ref name=Banduru /&gt;

Describing of anharmonic effects is complicated because exact treatment as in the harmonic case is not possible and phonons are no longer exact eigensolutions to the equations of motion. Even if the state of motion of the crystal could be described with a plane wave at a particular time, its accuracy would deteriorate progressively with time. Time development would have to be described by introducing a spectrum of other phonons, which is known as the phonon decay. The two most important anharmonic effects are the thermal expansion and the phonon thermal conductivity.

Only when the phonon number ‹n› deviates from the equilibrium value ‹n›&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, can a thermal current arise as stated in the following expression

:&lt;math&gt;Q_x=\frac{1}{V} \sum_{q,j} {\hslash \omega \left (\left \langle n \right \rangle-{ \left \langle n \right \rangle}^0 \right)v_x}\text{,}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is the energy transport velocity of phonons. Only two mechanisms exist that can cause time variation of ‹n› in a particular region. The number of phonons that diffuse into the region from neighboring regions differs from those that diffuse out, or phonons decay inside the same region into other phonons. A special form of the [[Boltzmann equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left \langle n\right \rangle}{dt}={\left(\frac{\partial \left \langle n\right \rangle}{\partial t}\right)}_{\text{diff.}}+{\left(\frac{\partial \left \langle n\right \rangle}{\partial t}\right)}_\text{decay}&lt;/math&gt;

states this. When steady state conditions are assumed the total time derivate of phonon number is zero, because the temperature is constant in time and therefore the phonon number stays also constant. Time variation due to phonon decay is described with a relaxation time (τ) approximation

:&lt;math&gt;{\left(\frac{\partial \left \langle n\right \rangle}{\partial t}\right)}_\text{decay}=-\text{ }\frac{\left \langle n\right \rangle-{\left \langle n\right \rangle}^{0}}{\tau },&lt;/math&gt;

which states that the more the phonon number deviates from its equilibrium value, the more its time variation increases. At steady state conditions and local thermal equilibrium are assumed we get the following equation

:&lt;math&gt;{\left(\frac{\partial \left(n\right)}{\partial t}\right)}_\text{diff.}=-{v}_{x}\frac{\partial {\left(n\right)}^{0}}{\partial T}\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\text{.}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the relaxation time approximation for the Boltzmann equation and assuming steady-state conditions, the phonon thermal conductivity λ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; can be determined. The temperature dependence for λ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; originates from the variety of processes, whose significance for λ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the temperature range of interest. Mean free path is one factor that determines the temperature dependence for λ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, as stated in the following equation

:&lt;math&gt;{\lambda }_{L}=\frac{1}{3V}\sum _{q,j}v\left(q,j\right)\Lambda \left(q,j\right)\frac{\partial }{\partial T}\epsilon \left(\omega \left(q,j\right),T\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where Λ is the mean free path for phonon and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial T}\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[heat capacity]]. This equation is a result of combining the four previous equations with each other and knowing that &lt;math&gt;\left \langle v_x^2\right \rangle=\frac{1}{3}v^2&lt;/math&gt; for cubic or isotropic systems and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =v\tau &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ssp&quot;&gt;

At low temperatures (&lt;10 K) the anharmonic interaction does not influence the mean free path and therefore, the thermal resistivity is determined only from processes for which q-conservation does not hold. These processes include the scattering of phonons by crystal defects, or the scattering from the surface of the crystal in case of high quality single crystal. Therefore, thermal conductance depends on the external dimensions of the crystal and the quality of the surface. Thus, temperature dependence of λ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is determined by the specific heat and is therefore proportional to T&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt;

Phonon quasimomentum is defined as ℏq and differs from normal momentum because it is only defined within an arbitrary reciprocal lattice vector. At higher temperatures (10 K&lt;T &lt;Θ), the conservation of energy &lt;math&gt;\hslash {\omega }_{1}=\hslash {\omega }_{2}+\hslash {\omega }_{3}&lt;/math&gt; and quasimomentum &lt;math&gt;{q}_{1}={q}_{2}+{q}_{3}+G&lt;/math&gt;, where '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is wave vector of the incident phonon and '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', q'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are wave vectors of the resultant phonons, may also involve a reciprocal lattice vector '''G''' complicating the energy transport process. These processes can also reverse the direction of energy transport.

Therefore, these processes are also known as Umklapp (U) processes and can only occur when phonons with sufficiently large q-vectors are excited, because unless the sum of '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;and''' q'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; points outside of the Brillouin zone the momentum is conserved and the process is normal scattering (N-process). The probability of a phonon to have energy E is given by the Boltzmann distribution &lt;math&gt;P\propto {e}^{-E/kT}&lt;/math&gt;. To U-process to occur the decaying phonon to have a wave vector '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that is roughly half of the diameter of the Brillouin zone, because otherwise quasimomentum would not be conserved.

Therefore, these phonons have to possess energy of &lt;math&gt;\sim k\Theta /2&lt;/math&gt;, which is a significant fraction of Debye energy that is needed to generate new phonons. The probability for this is proportional to &lt;math&gt;{e}^{-\Theta /bT}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;b=2&lt;/math&gt;. Temperature dependence of the mean free path has an exponential form &lt;math&gt;{e}^{\Theta /bT}&lt;/math&gt;. The presence of the reciprocal lattice wave vector implies a net phonon backscattering and a resistance to phonon and thermal transport resulting finite λ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name=Banduru /&gt; as it means that momentum is not conserved. Only momentum non-conserving processes can cause thermal resistance.&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt;

At high temperatures (T&gt;Θ) the mean free path and therefore λ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; has a temperature dependence T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, to which one arrives from formula &lt;math&gt;{e}^{\Theta /bT}&lt;/math&gt; by making the following approximation &lt;math&gt;{e}^{x}\propto x\text{ },\text{ }\left(x\right)&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and writing &lt;math&gt;x=\Theta /bT&lt;/math&gt;. This dependency is known as Eucken's law and originates from the temperature dependency of the probability for the U-process to occur.&lt;ref name=Banduru /&gt;&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt;

Thermal conductivity is usually described by the Boltzmann equation with the relaxation time approximation in which phonon scattering is a limiting factor. Another approach is to use analytic models or molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo based methods to describe thermal conductivity in solids.

Short wavelength phonons are strongly scattered by impurity atoms if an alloyed phase is present, but mid and long wavelength phonons are less affected. Mid and long wavelength phonons carry significant fraction of heat, so to further reduce lattice thermal conductivity one has to introduce structures to scatter these phonons. This is achieved by introducing interface scattering mechanism, which requires structures whose characteristic length is longer than that of impurity atom. Some possible ways to realize these interfaces are nanocomposites and embedded nanoparticles/structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ren&quot;&gt;

=== Electronic thermal conductivity ===

Hot electrons from higher energy states carry more thermal energy than cold electrons, while electrical conductivity is rather insensitive to the energy distribution of carriers because the amount of charge that electrons carry, does not depend on their energy. This is a physical reason for the greater sensitivity of electronic thermal conductivity to energy dependence of density of states and relaxation time, respectively.&lt;ref name=Banduru /&gt;

Mahan and Sofo (''PNAS ''1996 93 (15) 7436-7439)'' '' showed that materials with a certain electron structure have reduced electron thermal conductivity. Based on their analysis one can demonstrate that if the electron density of states in the material is close to the delta-function, the electronic thermal conductivity drops to zero. By taking the following equation &lt;math&gt;{\lambda }_{E}={\lambda }_{0}-T\sigma {S}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, where λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the electronic thermal conductivity when the electrochemical potential gradient inside the sample is zero, as a starting point. As next step the transport coefficients are written as following
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma ={\sigma }_{0}{I}_{0}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma S={\left(\frac{k}{e}\right)\sigma_{0}}{I}_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\lambda }_{0}={\left(\frac{k}{e}\right)}^{2}{\sigma }_{0}T{I}_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;{\sigma }_{0}={e}^{2}/\left(\hslash {a}_{0}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the Bohr radius. The dimensionless integrals ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;{I}_{n}=\underset{-\infty }{\overset{\infty }{\int }}\frac{{e}^{x}}{{\left({e}^{x}+1\right)}^{2}}s\left(x\right){x}^{n}dx&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''s''(''x'') is the dimensionless transport distribution function. The integrals ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the moments of the function
:&lt;math&gt;P\left(x\right)=D\left(x\right)s\left(x\right),\text{ }D\left(x\right)=\frac{{e}^{x}}{{\left({e}^{x}+1\right)}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''x'' is the energy of carriers. By substituting the previous formulas for the transport coefficient to the equation for ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; we get the following equation
:&lt;math&gt;{\lambda }_{\mathrm{E}}={\left(\frac{k}{e}\right)}^{2}{\sigma }_{0}T\left({I}_{2}-\frac{{I}_{1}^{2}}{{I}_{0}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
From the previous equation we see that ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; to be zero the bracketed term containing ''I''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; terms have to be zero. Now if we assume that
:&lt;math&gt;s\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)\delta \left(x-b\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
where δ is the [[Dirac delta function]], ''I''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; terms get the following expressions
:&lt;math&gt;{I}_{0}=D\left(b\right)f\left(b\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;{I}_{1}=D\left(b\right)f\left(b\right)b&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;{I}_{2}=D\left(b\right)f\left(b\right){b}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
By substituting these expressions to the equation for ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, we see that it goes to zero. Therefore, ''P''(''x'') has to be delta function.&lt;ref name=Ren /&gt;

== Equations ==

In an isotropic medium the thermal conductivity is the parameter ''k'' in the Fourier expression for the heat flux

:&lt;math&gt; \vec q = - k \vec \nabla T&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \vec q &lt;/math&gt; is the heat flux (amount of heat flowing per second and per unit area) and &lt;math&gt; \vec \nabla T&lt;/math&gt; the temperature [[gradient]]. The sign in the expression is chosen so that always ''k'' &gt; 0 as heat always flows from a high temperature to a low temperature. This is a direct consequence of the second law of thermodynamics.

In the one-dimensional case ''q'' = ''H''/''A'' with ''H''  the amount of heat flowing per second through a surface with area ''A'' and the temperature gradient is d''T''/d''x'' so

:&lt;math&gt;H= - k A\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}x}.&lt;/math&gt;

In case of a thermally-insulated bar (except at the ends) in the steady state ''H'' is constant. If ''A'' is constant as well the expression can be integrated with the result

:&lt;math&gt;HL= A\int_{T_L}^{T_H} k(T) \mathrm{d}T&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; are the temperatures at the hot end and the cold end respectively, and ''L'' is the length of the bar. It is convenient to introduce the thermal-conductivity integral

:&lt;math&gt;I_k(T) = \int_{0}^{T} k(T^\prime) \mathrm{d}T^\prime.&lt;/math&gt;

The heat flow rate is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;H= \frac{A}{L}[I_k(T_H)-I_k(T_L)].&lt;/math&gt;

If the temperature difference is small ''k'' can be taken as constant. In that case

:&lt;math&gt;H= kA\frac{T_H-T_L}{L}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Simple kinetic picture ==
[[File:Heat conduction in a gas 01.jpg|thumb|right|Gas atoms moving randomly through a surface.]]
In this Section we will derive an expression for the thermal conductivity. Consider a gas with hard-core interactions but negligible volume within a vertical temperature gradient. The upper side is hot and the lower side cold. There is a downward energy flow because the gas atoms, going down, have a higher energy than the atoms going up. The net flow of energy per second is the heat flow ''H''. The heat flow is proportional to the number of particles that cross the area ''A'' per second. This number is proportional to the product ''nvA'' where ''n'' is the particle density and ''v'' the mean particle velocity. The magnitude of the heat flow will also be proportional to amount of energy transported per particle so with the heat capacity per particle ''c'' and some characteristic temperature difference Δ''T''. So far we have

:&lt;math&gt;H\propto nvcA\Delta T.&lt;/math&gt;

The unit of ''H'' is J/s and of the right-hand side it is (particle/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)•(m/s)•(J/(K•particle))•(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)•(K) = J/s, so this is already of the right dimension. Only a numerical factor is missing. For Δ''T'' we take the temperature difference of the gas between two collisions

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T=l\frac{dT}{dz}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''l'' is the mean free path. Detailed kinetic calculations&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that the numerical factor is -1/3, so, all in all,

:&lt;math&gt;H=-\frac{1}{3}nvclA\frac{dT}{dz}.&lt;/math&gt;

Comparison with the one-dimension expression for the heat flow, given above, gives as the final result

:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{1}{3}nvcl. &lt;/math&gt;

The particle density and the heat capacity per particle can be combined as the heat capacity per unit volume

so

:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{1}{3}vl\frac{C_V}{V_m} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; is the molar heat capacity at constant volume and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; the molar volume.

For the hard-core gas the mean free path is given by

:&lt;math&gt;l\propto \frac{1}{n\sigma} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ'' is the collision cross section. So

:&lt;math&gt;k\propto \frac{c}{\sigma}v.&lt;/math&gt;

The heat capacity per particle ''c'' and the cross section ''σ'' both are temperature independent so the temperature dependence of ''k'' is determined by the ''T'' dependence of ''v''. For a monatomic gas, with atomic mass ''M'', ''v'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt; v=\sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}.&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;k\propto \sqrt{\frac{T}{M}} . &lt;/math&gt;

This expression also shows why gases with a low mass (hydrogen, helium) have a high thermal conductivity.

For '''metals at low temperatures''' the heat is carried mainly by the free electrons. In this case the mean velocity is the Fermi velocity which is temperature independent. The mean free path is determined by the impurities and the crystal imperfections which are temperature independent as well. So the only temperature-dependent quantity is the heat capacity ''c'', which, in this case, is proportional to ''T''. So

:&lt;math&gt;k=k_0 T \text{     (metal at low temperature)} &lt;/math&gt;

with ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; a constant. For pure metals such as copper, silver, etc. ''l'' is large, so the thermal conductivity is high. At higher temperatures the mean free path is limited by the phonons, so the thermal conductivity tends to decrease with temperature. In alloys the density of the impurities is very high, so ''l''  and, consequently ''k'', are small. Therefore, alloys, such as stainless steel, can be used for thermal insulation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5553">A '''plastic crystal''' is a [[crystal]] composed of weakly interacting molecules that possess some orientational or conformational degree of freedom. The name plastic crystal refers to the mechanical softness of such phases: they resemble waxes and are easily deformed. If the internal degree of freedom is molecular rotation, the name '''rotor phase''' or '''rotatory phase''' is also used. Typical examples are the [[modification]]s Methane I and Ethane I. 
In addition to the conventional molecular plastic crystals, there are also emerging ionic plastic crystals, particularly organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) and protic organic ionic plastic crystals (POIPCs).&lt;ref name=&quot;1,2,4-Triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate as an archetypal pure protic organic ionic plastic crystal electrolyte for all-solid-state fuel cells&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Imidazolium methanesulfonate as a high temperature proton conductor&quot;&gt;

If the internal degree of freedom freezes in a disordered way, an [[orientational glass]] is obtained.

The orientational degree of freedom may be an almost free rotation, or it may be a jump diffusion between a restricted number of possible orientations, as was shown for [[carbon tetrabromide]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a powder pattern this intensity appears to resemble an amorphous background as one would expect for a liquid,&lt;ref name=&quot;1,2,4-Triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate as an archetypal pure protic organic ionic plastic crystal electrolyte for all-solid-state fuel cells&quot;/&gt; but for a single crystal the diffuse contribution reveals itself to be highly structured. The Bragg peaks can be used to determine an average structure but due to the large amount of disorder this is not very insightful. It is the structure of the diffuse scattering that reflects the details of the constrained disorder in the system. Recent advances in two-dimensional detection at synchrotron beam lines facilitate the study of such patterns.

== Plastic crystals versus liquid crystals ==

Like [[liquid crystal]]s, plastic crystals can be considered a transitional stage between real solids and real liquids and can be considered ''soft matter''. Another common denominator is the simultaneous presence of order and disorder. Both types of phases are usually observed between the true solid and liquid phases on the temperature scale:

: true crystal -&gt; plastic crystal -&gt; true liquid
: true crystal -&gt; liquid crystal -&gt; true liquid

The difference between liquid and plastic crystals is easily observed in [[X-ray diffraction]]. Plastic crystals possess strong long range order and therefore show sharp Bragg reflections.&lt;ref name=&quot;1,2,4-Triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate as an archetypal pure protic organic ionic plastic crystal electrolyte for all-solid-state fuel cells&quot;/&gt; Liquid crystals show no or very broad Bragg peaks because the order is not long range. The molecules that give rise to liquid crystalline behavior often have a strongly elongated or disc like shape. Plastic crystals consist usually of almost spherical objects. In this respect one could see them as opposites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32145">'''Thermal conduction''' is the transfer of [[internal energy]] by microscopic [[diffusion]] and collisions of particles or quasi-particles within a body or between contiguous bodies. The microscopically diffusing and colliding objects include molecules, atoms, electrons, and phonons. They transfer disorganized microscopic kinetic and potential energy, which are jointly known as internal energy. Conduction takes place in all phases of [[ponderable matter]], such as solids, liquids, gases and plasmas, but it is distinctly recognizable only when the matter is undergoing neither chemical reaction nor differential local internal flows of distinct chemical constituents. In the presence of such chemically defined contributory sub-processes, only the flow of internal energy is recognizable, as distinct from thermal conduction. A net flow of energy solely because of a [[temperature gradient]] is recognized as a flow of [[heat]].

Heat spontaneously flows from a hotter to a colder body. For example, heat is conducted from the hotplate of an electric stove to the bottom of a saucepan in contact with it. In the absence of external drivers, within a body or between bodies, [[temperature]] differences decay over time, and [[thermal equilibrium]] is approached, temperature becoming more uniform.

In conduction, the heat flow is within and through the body itself. In contrast, in heat transfer by [[thermal radiation]], the transfer is often between bodies, which may be separated spatially. Also possible is transfer of heat by a combination of conduction and thermal radiation. In convection, internal energy is carried between bodies by a moving material carrier. In solids, conduction is mediated by the combination of vibrations and collisions of molecules, of propagation and collisions of [[phonons]], and of diffusion and collisions of [[Free electron model|free electrons]]. In gases and liquids, conduction is due to the collisions and [[Molecular diffusion|diffusion]] of molecules during their random motion. [[Photons]] in this context do not collide with one another, and so heat transport by [[electromagnetic radiation]] is conceptually distinct from heat conduction by microscopic diffusion and collisions of material particles and phonons. But the distinction is often not easily observed, unless the material is semi-transparent.

In the engineering sciences, heat transfer includes the processes of [[thermal radiation]], [[convection]], and sometimes mass transfer. Usually, more than one of these processes occurs in a given situation. The conventional symbol for the material property, [[thermal conductivity]], is &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Overview==
{{See also|Heat equation}}
On a microscopic scale, conduction occurs within a body considered as being stationary; this means that the kinetic and potential energies of the bulk motion of the body are separately accounted for. [[First law of thermodynamics|Internal energy]] diffuses as rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and [[molecule]]s interact with neighboring particles, transferring some of their microscopic kinetic and potential energies, these quantities being defined relative to the bulk of the body considered as being stationary. Heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms or molecules collide, or as several [[electron]]s move backwards and forwards from atom to atom in a disorganized way so as not to form a macroscopic electric current, or as phonons collide and scatter. Conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in [[thermal contact]]. Conduction is greater in solids because the network of relatively close fixed spatial relationships between atoms helps to transfer energy between them by vibration.

Fluids (and especially gases) are less conductive. This is due to the large distance between atoms in a gas: fewer collisions between atoms means less conduction. The conductivity of gases increases with temperature. Conductivity increases with increasing pressure from vacuum up to a critical point that the density of the gas is such that molecules of the gas may be expected to collide with each other before they transfer heat from one surface to another. After this point, conductivity increases only slightly with increasing pressure and density.

[[Thermal contact conductance]] is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact. A temperature drop is often observed at the interface between the two surfaces in contact. This phenomenon is said to be a result of a thermal contact resistance existing between the contacting surfaces. [[Interfacial thermal resistance]] is a measure of an interface's resistance to thermal flow. This thermal resistance differs from contact resistance, as it exists even at atomically perfect interfaces. Understanding the thermal resistance at the interface between two materials is of primary significance in the study of its thermal properties. Interfaces often contribute significantly to the observed properties of the materials.

The inter-molecular transfer of energy could be primarily by elastic impact, as in fluids, or by free electron diffusion, as in metals, or [[phonon|phonon vibration]], as in insulators. In [[thermal insulation|insulators]], the heat flux is carried almost entirely by [[phonon]] vibrations.

Metals (e.g., copper, platinum, gold, etc.) are usually good [[heat conduction|conductors]] of thermal energy. This is due to the way that metals bond chemically: [[metallic bond]]s (as opposed to [[covalent bonds|covalent]] or [[ionic bonds]]) have free-moving electrons that transfer thermal energy rapidly through the metal. The ''electron fluid'' of a [[Electrical conductor|conductive]] metallic solid conducts most of the heat flux through the solid. Phonon flux is still present, but carries less of the energy. Electrons also conduct [[electric current]] through conductive solids, and the [[thermal conductivity|thermal]] and [[electrical conductivity|electrical conductivities]] of most metals have about the same ratio. A good electrical conductor, such as [[copper]], also conducts heat well. [[Thermoelectricity]] is caused by the interaction of heat flux and electric current. Heat conduction within a solid is directly analogous to [[diffusion]] of particles within a fluid, in the situation where there are no fluid currents.

To quantify the ease with which a particular medium conducts, engineers employ the [[thermal conductivity]], also known as the conductivity constant or conduction coefficient, ''k''. In [[thermal conductivity]], ''k'' is defined as &quot;the quantity of heat, ''Q'', transmitted in time (''t'') through a thickness (''L''), in a direction normal to a surface of area (''A''), due to a temperature difference (Δ''T'') [...]&quot;. Thermal conductivity is a material ''[[physical property|property]]'' that is primarily dependent on the medium's [[list of phases of matter|phase]], temperature, density, and molecular bonding. [[Thermal effusivity]] is a quantity derived from conductivity, which is a measure of its ability to exchange thermal energy with its surroundings.

===Steady-state conduction===
Steady state conduction is the form of conduction that happens when the temperature difference(s) driving the conduction are constant, so that (after an equilibration time), the spatial distribution of temperatures (temperature field) in the conducting object does not change any further. Thus, all partial derivatives of temperature ''with respect to space'' may either be zero or have nonzero values, but all derivatives of temperature at any point ''with respect to time'' are uniformly zero. In steady state conduction, the amount of heat entering any region of an object is equal to amount of heat coming out (if this were not so, the temperature would be rising or falling, as thermal energy was tapped or trapped in a region).

For example, a bar may be cold at one end and hot at the other, but after a state of steady state conduction is reached, the spatial gradient of temperatures along the bar does not change any further, as time proceeds. Instead, the temperature at any given section of the rod remains constant, and this temperature varies linearly in space, along the direction of heat transfer.

In steady state conduction, all the laws of direct current electrical conduction can be applied to &quot;heat currents&quot;. In such cases, it is possible to take &quot;thermal resistances&quot; as the analog to [[electrical resistance]]s. In such cases, temperature plays the role of voltage, and heat transferred per unit time (heat power) is the analog of electric current. Steady state systems can be modelled by networks of such thermal resistances in series and in parallel, in exact analogy to electrical networks of resistors. See [[Lumped capacitance model#Thermal purely resistive circuits|purely resistive thermal circuits]] for an example of such a network.

===Transient conduction===
{{main|Heat equation}}
In general, during any period in which temperatures change ''in time'' at any place within an object, the mode of thermal energy flow is termed ''transient conduction.'' Another term is &quot;non steady-state&quot; conduction, referring to time-dependence of temperature fields in an object. Non-steady-state situations appear after an imposed change in temperature at a boundary of an object. They may also occur with temperature changes inside an object, as a result of a new source or sink of heat suddenly introduced within an object, causing temperatures near the source or sink to change in time.

When a new perturbation of temperature of this type happens, temperatures within the system change in time toward a new equilibrium with the new conditions, provided that these do not change. After equilibrium, heat flow into the system once again equals the heat flow out, and temperatures at each point inside the system no longer change. Once this happens, transient conduction is ended, although steady-state conduction may continue if heat flow continues.

If changes in external temperatures or internal heat generation changes are too rapid for the equilibrium of temperatures in space to take place, then the system never reaches a state of unchanging temperature distribution in time, and the system remains in a transient state.

An example of a new source of heat &quot;turning on&quot; within an object, causing transient conduction, is an engine starting in an automobile. In this case, the transient thermal conduction phase for the entire machine is over, and the steady state phase appears, as soon as the engine reaches steady-state [[operating temperature]]. In this state of steady-state equilibrium, temperatures vary greatly from the engine cylinders to other parts of the automobile, but at no point in space within the automobile does temperature increase or decrease. After establishing this state, the transient conduction phase of heat transfer is over.

New external conditions also cause this process: for example the copper bar in the example steady-state conduction experiences transient conduction as soon as one end is subjected to a different temperature from the other. Over time, the field of temperatures inside the bar reach a new steady-state, in which a constant temperature gradient along the bar is finally set up, and this gradient then stays constant in space. Typically, such a new steady state gradient is approached exponentially with time after a new temperature-or-heat source or sink, has been introduced. When a &quot;transient conduction&quot; phase is over, heat flow may still continue at high power, so long as temperatures do not change.

An example of transient conduction that does not end with steady-state conduction, but rather no conduction, occurs when a hot copper ball is dropped into oil at a low temperature. Here, the temperature field within the object begins to change as a function of time, as the heat is removed from the metal, and the interest lies in analyzing this spatial change of temperature within the object over time, until all gradients disappear entirely (the ball has reached the same temperature as the oil). Mathematically, this condition is also approached exponentially; in theory it takes infinite time, but in practice it is over, for all intents and purposes, in a much shorter period. At the end of this process with no heat sink but the internal parts of the ball (which are finite), there is no steady state heat conduction to reach. Such a state never occurs in this situation, but rather the end of the process is when there is no heat conduction at all.

The analysis of non steady-state conduction systems is more complex than that of steady-state systems. If the conducting body has a simple shape, then exact analytical mathematical expressions and solutions may be possible (see [[heat equation]] for the analytical approach).&lt;ref&gt;The [http://exact.unl.edu Exact Analytical Conduction Toolbox ] contains a variety of transient expressions for heat conduction, along with algorithms and computer code for obtaining precise numerical values.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most often, because of complicated shapes with varying [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductivities]] within the shape (i.e., most complex objects, mechanisms or machines in engineering) often the application of approximate theories is required, and/or numerical analysis by computer. One popular graphical method involves the use of [[Heisler Chart]]s.

Occasionally, transient conduction problems may be considerably simplified if regions of the object being heated or cooled can be identified, for which [[thermal conductivity]] is very much greater than that for heat paths leading into the region. In this case, the region with high conductivity can often be treated in the [[lumped capacitance model]], as a &quot;lump&quot; of material with a simple thermal capacitance consisting of its aggregate [[heat capacity]]. Such regions warm or cool, but show no significant temperature ''variation'' across their extent, during the process (as compared to the rest of the system). This is due to their far higher conductance. During transient conduction, therefore, the temperature across their conductive regions changes uniformly in space, and as a simple exponential in time. An example of such systems are those that follow ''Newton's law of cooling'' during transient cooling (or the reverse during heating). The equivalent thermal circuit consists of a simple capacitor in series with a resistor. In such cases, the remainder of the system with high thermal resistance (comparatively low conductivity) plays the role of the resistor in the circuit.

===Relativistic conduction===
The theory of [[relativistic heat conduction]] is a model that is compatible with the theory of special relativity. For most of the last century, it was recognized that the Fourier equation is in contradiction with the theory of relativity because it admits an infinite speed of propagation of heat signals. For example, according to the Fourier equation, a pulse of heat at the origin would be felt at infinity instantaneously. The speed of information propagation is faster than the speed of light in vacuum, which is physically inadmissible within the framework of relativity. Alterations to the Fourier model provided for a relativistic model of heat conduction, avoiding this problem.

===Quantum conduction===
[[Second sound]] is a [[quantum mechanical]] phenomenon in which [[heat transfer]] occurs by [[wave equation|wave]]-like motion, rather than by the more usual mechanism of [[diffusion]]. Heat takes the place of pressure in normal sound waves. This leads to a very high [[thermal conductivity]]. It is known as &quot;second sound&quot; because the wave motion of heat is similar to the propagation of sound in air.

==Fourier's law==
The law of heat conduction, also known as [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]]'s law, states that the time rate of [[heat transfer]] through a material is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the negative [[gradient]] in the temperature and to the area, at right angles to that gradient, through which the heat flows. We can state this law in two equivalent forms: the integral form, in which we look at the amount of energy flowing into or out of a body as a whole, and the differential form, in which we look at the flow rates or [[Heat flux|fluxes]] of energy locally.

[[Newton's law of cooling]] is a discrete analog of Fourier's law, while [[Ohm's law]] is the electrical analogue of Fourier's law.

===Differential form===
The differential form of Fourier's Law of thermal conduction shows that the local [[heat flux]] density, &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{q}&lt;/math&gt;, is equal to the product of [[thermal conductivity]], &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and the negative local temperature gradient, &lt;math&gt;-\nabla T&lt;/math&gt;. The heat flux density is the amount of energy that flows through a unit area per unit time.

: &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{q} = - k {\nabla} T&lt;/math&gt;

where (including the [[SI]] units)
: &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{q}&lt;/math&gt; is the local heat flux density, [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\big.k\big.&lt;/math&gt; is the material's [[thermal conductivity|conductivity]], [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·[[Kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;\big.\nabla T\big.&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature gradient, [[Kelvin|K]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.
The thermal conductivity, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, is often treated as a constant, though this is not always true. While the thermal conductivity of a material generally varies with temperature, the variation can be small over a significant range of temperatures for some common materials. In anisotropic materials, the thermal conductivity typically varies with orientation; in this case &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is represented by a second-order [[tensor]]. In non uniform materials, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; varies with spatial location.

For many simple applications, Fourier's law is used in its one-dimensional form. In the ''x''-direction,

: &lt;math&gt;q_x = - k \frac{d T}{d x}&lt;/math&gt;

===Integral form===
By integrating the differential form over the material's total surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, we arrive at the integral form of Fourier's law:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} = -k \oint_S{{\nabla} T \cdot \,\overrightarrow{dA}} &lt;/math&gt;
where (including the [[SI]] units):
* &lt;math&gt;\big. \frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}\big.&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of heat transferred per unit time (in W), and
* &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{dA}&lt;/math&gt; is an oriented surface area element (in m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:exponential Heat flow.svg|thumb|200px|exponential heat flow]] --&gt;The above [[differential equation]], when [[Integral|integrated]] for a homogeneous material of 1-D geometry between two endpoints at constant temperature, gives the heat flow rate as:
: &lt;math&gt; \big. \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = -k A \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x} &lt;/math&gt;
where
: ''A'' is the cross-sectional surface area,
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature difference between the ends,
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the ends.
This law forms the basis for the derivation of the [[heat equation]].

==Conductance==
Writing
: &lt;math&gt;\big. U = \frac{k}{\Delta x}, \quad&lt;/math&gt;
where ''U'' is the conductance, in W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; K).

Fourier's law can also be stated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\big. \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = U A\, (-\Delta T).&lt;/math&gt;

The reciprocal of conductance is resistance, R, given by:
: &lt;math&gt; \big. R = \frac{1}{U} = \frac{\Delta x}{k} = \frac{A\, (-\Delta T)}{\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Resistance is additive when several conducting layers lie between the hot and cool regions, because ''A'' and ''Q'' are the same for all layers. In a multilayer partition, the total conductance is related to the conductance of its layers by:

: &lt;math&gt;\big. \frac{1}{U} = \frac{1}{U_1} + \frac{1}{U_2} + \frac{1}{U_3}+ \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

So, when dealing with a multilayer partition, the following formula is usually used:

: &lt;math&gt;\big. \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{A\,(-\Delta T)}{\frac{\Delta x_1}{k_1} + \frac{\Delta x_2}{k_2} + \frac{\Delta x_3}{k_3}+ \cdots}.&lt;/math&gt;

For heat conduction from one fluid to another through a barrier, it is sometimes important to consider the conductance of the [[thin film]] of fluid that remains stationary next to the barrier. This thin film of fluid is difficult to quantify because its characteristics depend upon complex conditions of [[turbulence]] and [[viscosity]]—but when dealing with thin high-conductance barriers it can sometimes be quite significant.

===Intensive-property representation===
The previous conductance equations, written in terms of [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive properties]], can be reformulated in terms of [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive properties]].

&lt;!-- material was posted as a revision suggestion for the article  --&gt;
Ideally, the formulae for conductance should produce a quantity with dimensions independent of distance, like [[Ohm's Law]] for electrical resistance: &lt;math&gt;R = V/I\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and conductance: &lt;math&gt; G = I/V \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

From the electrical formula: &lt;math&gt;R = \rho x / A \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, where ρ is resistivity, x is length, and A is cross-sectional area, we have &lt;math&gt;G = k A / x \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, where G is conductance, k is conductivity, x is length, and A is cross-sectional area.

For Heat,

: &lt;math&gt;\big. U = \frac{k A} {\Delta x}, \quad&lt;/math&gt;
where ''U'' is the conductance.

Fourier's law can also be stated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\big. \dot{Q} = U \, \Delta T \quad&lt;/math&gt;

analogous to Ohm's law: &lt;math&gt; I = V/R \,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; I = V G. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The reciprocal of conductance is resistance, R, given by:
: &lt;math&gt;\big. R = \frac{\Delta T}{\dot{Q}}, \quad&lt;/math&gt;

analogous to Ohm's law: &lt;math&gt; R = V/I. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The rules for combining resistances and conductances (in series and in parallel) are the same for both heat flow and electric current.

===Cylindrical shells===
Conduction through cylindrical shells (e.g. pipes) can be calculated from the internal radius, &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;, the external radius, &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt;, the length, &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, and the temperature difference between the inner and outer wall, &lt;math&gt;T_2 - T_1&lt;/math&gt;.

The surface area of the cylinder is &lt;math&gt;A_r= 2 \pi r \ell&lt;/math&gt;

When Fourier's equation is applied:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q} = -k A_r \frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}r} = -2 k \pi r \ell \frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}r}&lt;/math&gt;

and rearranged:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q} \int_{r_1}^{r_2} \frac{1}{r} \mathrm{d}r = -2 k \pi \ell \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \mathrm{d}T&lt;/math&gt;

then the rate of heat transfer is:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q} = 2 k \pi \ell \frac{T_1 - T_2}{\ln (r_2 /r_1)}&lt;/math&gt;

the thermal resistance is:

:&lt;math&gt;R_c = \frac{\Delta T}{\dot{Q}}= \frac{\ln (r_2 /r_1)}{2 \pi k \ell}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q} = 2 \pi k \ell r_m \frac{T_1-T_2}{r_2-r_1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r_m = \frac{r_2-r_1}{\ln (r_2 /r_1)}&lt;/math&gt;. It is important to note that this is the log-mean radius.

===Spherical===
The conduction through a spherical shell with internal radius, &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;, and external radius, &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt;, can be calculated in a similar manner as for a cylindrical shell.

The [[surface area]] of the sphere is: &lt;math&gt;\!A = 4\pi r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Solving in a similar manner as for a cylindrical shell (see above) produces:
&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q} = 4 k \pi \frac{T_1 - T_2}{1/{r_1}-1/{r_2}} = 4 k \pi \frac{(T_1 - T_2) r_1 r_2}{r_2-r_1}&lt;/math&gt;

==Transient thermal conduction==
{{main|heat equation}}
===Interface heat transfer===
{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}
The heat transfer at an interface is considered a transient heat flow. To analyze this problem, the Biot number is important to understand how the system behaves. The Biot number is determined by:
&lt;math&gt; \textit{Bi}= \frac{hL}{k} &lt;/math&gt;
The heat transfer coefficient, h, is introduced in this formula, and is measured in &lt;math&gt; \frac{J}{m^{2}sK} &lt;/math&gt;.
If the system has a Biot number of less than 0.1, the material behaves according to Newtonian cooling, i.e. with negligible temperature gradient within the body. If the Biot number is greater than 0.1, the system behaves as a series solution. The temperature profile in terms of time can be determined by the function can be derived from the equation

: &lt;math&gt;q=-h \, \Delta T, &lt;/math&gt;

which becomes

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{T-T_f}{T_i - T_f} = \operatorname{exp} \left [ \frac{-hAt}{\rho C_p V} \right ]. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[heat transfer coefficient]], ''h'', is measured in &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{\frac{W}{m^2 K}} &lt;/math&gt;, and represents the transfer of heat at an interface between two materials. This value is different at every interface, and is an important concept in understanding heat flow at an interface.

The series solution can be analyzed with a [[nomogram]]. A nomogram has relative temperature as the ''y'' coordinate and the Fourier number, which is calculated by

: &lt;math&gt;\textit{Fo}= \frac{\alpha t}{L^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

The Biot number increases as the Fourier number decreases. There are five steps to determine a temperature profile in terms of time.
# Calculate the Biot number
# Determine which relative depth matters, either ''x'' or ''L''.
# Convert time to the Fourier number.
# Convert &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; to relative temperature with the boundary conditions.
# Compared required point to trace specified Biot number on the nomogram.

==Thermal conduction applications==

===Splat cooling===

[[Splat cooling]] is a method for quenching small droplets of molten materials by rapid contact with a cold surface. The particles undergo a characteristic cooling process, with the heat profile at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; for initial temperature as the maximum at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T = 0&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x = -\infin&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x = \infin &lt;/math&gt;, and the heat profile at &lt;math&gt;t=\infin &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;-\infin \le x \le \infin&lt;/math&gt; as the boundary conditions. Splat cooling rapidly ends in a steady state temperature, and is similar in form to the Gaussian diffusion equation. The temperature profile, with respect to the position and time of this type of cooling, varies with:

&lt;math&gt; T(x,t) - T_i = \frac{T_i \Delta X}{2\sqrt{\pi \alpha t}} \operatorname{exp} \left ( -\frac{x^2}{4 \alpha t} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

Splat cooling is a fundamental concept that has been adapted for practical use in the form of [[thermal spraying]]. The [[thermal diffusivity]] coefficient, represented as &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, can be written as &lt;math&gt; \alpha =\frac{k}{\rho C_p} &lt;/math&gt;. This varies according to the material.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZhangZhao2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sam Zhang|author2=Dongliang Zhao|title=Aeronautical and Aerospace Materials Handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PJQmI7hix8kC&amp;pg=PA304|accessdate=7 May 2013|date=19 November 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-7329-8|pages=304–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eein2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Eein|title=Drop-Surface Interactions.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qecltbmIbC4C&amp;pg=PA174|accessdate=7 May 2013|year=2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-83692-7|pages=174–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal quenching===

Metal [[quenching]] is a transient heat transfer process in terms of the [[Isothermal transformation diagram|Time Temperature Transformation]] (TTT). It is possible to manipulate the cooling process to adjust the phase of a suitable material. For example, appropriate quenching of steel can convert a desirable proportion of its content of [[austenite]] to [[martensite]], creating a very tough product. To achieve this, it is necessary to quench at the &quot;nose&quot; (or [[Eutectic_system|eutectic]]) of the TTT diagram. Since materials differ in their [[Biot number]]s, the time it takes for the material to quench, or the [[Fourier number]], varies in practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;AsthanaKumar2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rajiv Asthana|author2=Ashok Kumar|author3=Narendra B.

Usually, the correct figures are read from a standard [[nomogram]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013|reason=Where is this nomogram published?}} By calculating the heat transfer coefficient from this Biot number, one can find a liquid medium suitable for the application.&lt;ref name=&quot;Totten2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=George E.

==Zeroth law of thermodynamics==

One statement of the so-called [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]] is directly focused on the idea of conduction of heat. Bailyn (1994) writes that &quot;... the zeroth law may be stated:

::All diathermal walls are equivalent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, New York, ISBN 0-88318-797-3, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Thermodynamic system#boundary|diathermal wall]] is a physical connection between two bodies that allows the passage of heat between them. Bailyn is referring to diathermal walls that exclusively connect two bodies, especially conductive walls.

This statement of the 'zeroth law' belongs to an idealized theoretical discourse, and actual physical walls may have peculiarities that do not conform to its generality.

For example, the material of the wall must not undergo a phase transition, such as evaporation or fusion, at the temperature at which it must conduct heat. But when only thermal equilibrium is considered and time is not urgent, so that the conductivity of the material does not matter too much, one suitable heat conductor is as good as another. Conversely, another aspect of the zeroth law is that, subject again to suitable restrictions, a given diathermal wall is indifferent to the nature of the heat bath to which it is connected. For example, the glass bulb of a thermometer acts as a diathermal wall whether exposed to a gas or to a liquid, provided they do not corrode or melt it.

These indifferences are amongst the defining characteristics of [[heat transfer]]. In a sense, they are [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] of heat transfer.

When Etherington introduced this equation in 1933, he mentioned that this equation was proposed by Tolman as a way to test a cosmological model.

This statement is fundamental in the derivation of the reciprocity theorem.

'''Film speed''' is the measure of a [[photographic film]]'s [[photosensitivity|sensitivity to light]], determined by [[sensitometry]] and measured on [[#Film|various numerical scales]], the most recent being the [[#ISO|ISO]] system. A closely related ISO system is used to measure the [[#Digital|sensitivity of digital imaging systems]].

Relatively insensitive film, with a correspondingly lower speed index, requires more [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] to light to produce the same image density as a more sensitive film, and is thus commonly termed a ''slow film''. Highly sensitive films are correspondingly termed ''fast films''. In both digital and film photography, the reduction of exposure corresponding to use of higher sensitivities generally leads to reduced image quality (via coarser [[film grain]] or higher [[image noise]] of other types). In short, the higher the sensitivity, the grainier the image will be. Ultimately sensitivity is limited by the [[quantum efficiency]] of the film or sensor.
[[File:Provia 100F RDPIII Box with ISO film speed.jpg|thumb|right|This film container denotes its speed as ISO 100/21°, including both arithmetic (100 ASA) and logarithmic (21 DIN) components. The second is often dropped, making (e.g.) &quot;ISO 100&quot; effectively equivalent to the older ASA speed. (As is common, the &quot;100&quot; in the film name alludes to its ISO rating).]]

===Historical systems===

====Warnerke{{anchor|Chapman Jones|Henry Chapman Jones|Jones}}====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#Warnerke&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
The first known practical [[sensitometry|sensitometer]], which allowed measurements of the speed of photographic materials, was invented by the Polish engineer [[Leon Warnerke]]&lt;ref name=&quot;DIN_1934_DIN-4512_Introduction&quot;/&gt; – pseudonym of {{lang|pl|[[Władysław Małachowski]]}} (1837–1900) – in 1880, among the achievements for which he was awarded the [[Progress Medal (RPS)|Progress Medal]] of the [[Photographic Society of Great Britain]]&lt;!-- today named: Royal Photographic Society (RPS) --&gt; in 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPS_2011_Progress_Medal_1882&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones_1911_Cyclopaedia&quot;/&gt; It was commercialized since 1881.

The Warnerke Standard Sensitometer consisted of a frame holding an opaque screen with an array of typically 25 numbered, gradually pigmented squares brought into contact with the photographic plate during a timed test exposure under a [[Phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] tablet excited before by the light of a burning [[Magnesium]] ribbon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones_1911_Cyclopaedia&quot;/&gt; The speed of the emulsion was then expressed in 'degrees' Warnerke (sometimes seen as Warn. or °W.) corresponding with the last number visible on the exposed plate after development and fixation. Each number represented an increase of 1/3 in speed, typical plate speeds were between 10° and 25° Warnerke at the time.&lt;!-- According to Josef Maria Eder - History of photography: p. 451: 20° Warnerke = 10° (European) Scheiner, 24-25° Warnerke = 16-18° (European) Scheiner. --&gt;

His system saw some success but proved to be unreliable&lt;ref name=&quot;DIN_1934_DIN-4512_Introduction&quot;/&gt; due to its spectral sensitivity to light, the fading intensity of the light emitted by the phosphorescent tablet after its excitation as well as high built-tolerances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones_1911_Cyclopaedia&quot;/&gt; The concept, however, was later built upon in 1900 by [[Henry Chapman Jones]] (1855–1932)&lt;!-- 1932-03-07 --&gt; in the development of his &lt;!-- so called Chapman Jones --&gt;plate tester and modified speed system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones_1911_Cyclopaedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hasluck_1905_Jones&quot;/&gt;

====Hurter &amp;amp; Driffield{{anchor|H&amp;D}}====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#H&amp;D&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
Another early practical system for measuring the sensitivity of an emulsion was that of [[Hurter and Driffield]] (H&amp;D), originally described in 1890, by the Swiss-born [[Ferdinand Hurter]] (1844–1898) and British [[Vero Charles Driffield]] (1848–1915). In their system, speed numbers were inversely proportional to the exposure required. For example, an emulsion rated at 250 H&amp;D would require ten times the exposure of an emulsion rated at 2500 H&amp;D.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sowerby&quot;/&gt;

The methods to determine the sensitivity were later modified in 1925 (in regard to the light source used) and in 1928 (regarding light source, developer and proportional factor)—this later variant was sometimes called &quot;H&amp;D 10&quot;. The H&amp;D system was officially&lt;ref name=&quot;Konovalov_2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- TBD: I found documents stating that there was no standard before 1945, so we should find some historic documents stating that H&amp;D (or whatever) was really an *official* standard in the USSR, and not just semi-standard. Also, since GOST 2817-45 was apparently first defined in 1945, why was the GOST standard not introduced before 1951, when its revision GOST 2817-50 was already in place? Runner1616: Until 1951 both standards existed simultanously in USSR. Any photo book before 1950 operated with H&amp;D (Х и Д) --&gt; accepted as a standard in the former [[Soviet Union]] from 1928 until September 1951, when it was superseded by [[#GOST|GOST]] 2817-50.

====Scheiner{{anchor|Scheinergrade|Sch|Sch.}}====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#Scheiner&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
The ''Scheinergrade'' (Sch.) system was devised by the German astronomer [[Julius Scheiner]] (1858–1913) in 1894 originally as a method of comparing the speeds of plates used for astronomical photography. Scheiner's system rated the speed of a plate by the least exposure to produce a visible darkening upon development. Speed was expressed in degrees Scheiner, originally ranging from 1° Sch. to 20° Sch., where an increment of 19° Sch. corresponded to a hundredfold increase in sensitivity, which meant that an increment of 3° Sch. came close to a doubling of sensitivity.&lt;ref name =&quot;Sowerby&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Riat_2006&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[19]{100}^3 = 2.06914...\approx 2&lt;/math&gt;

The system was later extended to cover larger ranges and some of its practical shortcomings were addressed by the Austrian scientist [[Josef Maria Eder]] (1855–1944)&lt;ref name=&quot;DIN_1934_DIN-4512_Introduction&quot;/&gt; and Flemish-born botanist {{ill|de|Walter Hecht|Walter Hecht}} (1896–1960), (who, in 1919/1920, jointly developed their ''Eder–Hecht neutral wedge sensitometer'' measuring emulsion speeds in ''Eder–Hecht'' grades). Still, it remained difficult for manufactures to reliably determine film speeds, often only by comparing with competing products,&lt;ref name=&quot;DIN_1934_DIN-4512_Introduction&quot;/&gt; so that an increasing number of modified semi-Scheiner-based systems started to spread, which no longer followed Scheiner's original procedures and thereby defeated the idea of comparability.&lt;ref name=&quot;DIN_1934_DIN-4512_Introduction&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheppard_1932_Dresden-Congress&quot;/&gt;

Scheiner's system was eventually abandoned in Germany, when the standardized [[#DIN|DIN]] system was introduced in 1934. In various forms, it continued to be in widespread use in other countries for some time.

====DIN{{anchor|DIN 4512|DIN 4512-1|DIN 4512-4|DIN 4512-5}}====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#DIN. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
The DIN system, officially DIN standard 4512 by ''{{lang|de|[[Deutsches Institut für Normung]]}}'' (but still named ''{{lang|de|Deutscher Normenausschuß}}''&lt;!-- sic, old German spelling, no typo here --&gt; (DNA) at this time), was published in January 1934. It grew out of drafts for a standardized method of sensitometry put forward by ''{{lang|de|Deutscher Normenausschuß für Phototechnik}}''&lt;!-- sic, old German spelling, no typo here --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheppard_1932_Dresden-Congress&quot;/&gt; as proposed by the committee for sensitometry of the ''{{lang|de|Deutsche Gesellschaft für photographische Forschung}}''&lt;ref name=&quot;Biltz_1933_DIN-Grade&quot;/&gt; since 1930&lt;ref name=&quot;Heisenberg_1930_Tagung&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Voss_2002_Luther&quot;/&gt; and presented by {{ill|de|Robert Thomas Dietrich Luther{{!}}Robert Luther|Robert Thomas Dietrich Luther}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Voss_2002_Luther&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckland_2008_Kinamo&quot;/&gt; (1868–1945)&lt;!-- 1868-01-02 (21. December 1867 in Julian caldendar) to 1945-04-17, chemist --&gt; and [[Emanuel Goldberg]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckland_2008_Kinamo&quot;/&gt; (1881–1970) at the influential VIII. [[International Congress of Photography]] (German: ''{{lang|de|Internationaler Kongreß für wissenschaftliche und angewandte Photographie}}''&lt;!-- sic, old German spelling, no typos here --&gt;) held in [[Dresden]] from August 3 to 8, 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheppard_1932_Dresden-Congress&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eggert_1932_Kongress-Bericht&quot;/&gt;

The DIN system was inspired by [[#Scheiner|Scheiner]]'s system,&lt;ref name=&quot;DIN_1934_DIN-4512_Introduction&quot;/&gt; but the sensitivities were represented as the base 10 logarithm of the sensitivity multiplied by 10, similar to [[decibel]]s. Thus an increase of 20° (and not 19° as in Scheiner's system) represented a hundredfold increase in sensitivity, and a difference of 3° was much closer to the base 10 logarithm of 2 (0.30103…):&lt;ref name=&quot;Riat_2006&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}{(2)} = 0.30103... \approx 3/10&lt;/math&gt;

As in the Scheiner system, speeds were expressed in 'degrees'. Originally the sensitivity was written as a fraction with 'tenths' (for example &quot;18/10° DIN&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Benser_1957_Farbig&quot;/&gt; where the resultant value 1.8 represented the relative base 10 logarithm of the speed. 'Tenths' were later abandoned with DIN 4512:1957-11, and the example above would be written as &quot;18° DIN&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sowerby&quot;/&gt; The degree symbol was finally dropped with DIN 4512:1961-10. This revision also saw significant changes in the definition of film speeds in order to accommodate then-recent changes in the American [[#ASA|ASA]] PH2.5-1960 standard, so that film speeds of black-and-white negative film effectively would become doubled, that is, a film previously marked as &quot;18° DIN&quot;&lt;!-- with degree symbol --&gt; would now be labeled as &quot;21 DIN&quot;&lt;!-- without degree symbol --&gt; without emulsion changes.

Originally only meant for black-and-white negative film, the system was later extended and regrouped into nine parts, including DIN 4512-1:1971-04 for black-and-white negative film, DIN 4512-4:1977-06 for color reversal film and DIN 4512-5:1977-10 for color negative film.

On an international level the German DIN 4512 system has been effectively superseded in the 1980s by ISO 6:1974,&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_6&quot;/&gt; ISO 2240:1982,&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt; and ISO 5800:1979&lt;ref name=&quot;iso.org&quot;/&gt; where the same sensitivity is written in linear and logarithmic form as &quot;ISO 100/21°&quot; (now again with degree symbol). These [[#ISO|ISO]] standards were subsequently adopted by DIN as well. Finally, the latest DIN 4512 revisions were replaced by corresponding ISO standards, DIN 4512-1:1993-05 by DIN ISO 6:1996-02 in September 2000, DIN 4512-4:1985-08 by DIN ISO 2240:1998-06 and DIN 4512-5:1990-11 by DIN ISO 5800:1998-06 both in July 2002.&lt;!-- DIN 4512-3:1973-01 was replaced by DIN 4512-7:1993-01, DIN 4512-8:1993-01 and DIN 4512-9:1993-01. DIN 4512-6:1980-07 was withdrawn. As far as I know, DIN 4512-7:1993-01, DIN 4512-8:1993-01, DIN 4512-9:1993-01 as well as DIN 4512-10:1993-01 are still active as of this writing (2011-07), but don't define film speeds. --&gt;

The film speed scale recommended by the [[British Standards Institution]] (BSI) was almost identical to the DIN system except that the BS number was 10 degrees greater than the DIN number.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- TBD: I saw various logarithmic and arithmetic scales described as BS or BSI.

&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#Weston&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
Before the advent of the ASA system, the system of ''Weston film speed ratings'' was introduced by [[Edward Faraday Weston]]&lt;!-- no relation with [[Edward Henry Weston]], the famous photographer --&gt; (1878–1971) and his father Dr. [[Edward Weston (chemist)|Edward&lt;!-- W.? - see comment below --&gt; Weston]]&lt;!-- no relation with [[Edward Henry Weston]], the famous photographer --&gt; (1850–1936), a British-born electrical engineer, industrialist and founder of the US-based [[Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulhern_1990_Letter&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- Note: Both above mentioned patents of Edward F.

Weston claimed the Weston film speed rating system was in use for over 15 years already. Reportedly, the Master II was introduced as early as 1945. The manual of the Master Universal model 715 (1939) explicitly mentioned the speed ratings already. The manual of the Universal model 650 (1937) seems to mention them to, but does not name them as such. Goodwin published &quot;Weston emulsion speed ratings&quot; in 1938. So they must have been introduced between 1932 and 1938. --&gt; and later received a [[Howard N. Potts Medal]] for his contributions to engineering.&lt;!-- Franklin Institute, Howard N. Potts Medal, 1958, Engineering, &quot;Contributions to the fields of electrical measuring instruments, and for work on photoelectric exposure meters and establishing a scale for film speeds.&quot; http://www.fi.edu/winners/detail.faw?winner_id=2912 --&gt;&lt;!-- Goodwin's patents regarding exposure meters: &quot;Photographic exposure meter&quot;, US patent 2073790, filed: 1932-10-21, issued 1937-03-16, http://www.google.de/patents/about?id=txdQAAAAEBAJ. &quot;Photoelectric cell circuit&quot;, US patent 2032010, filed 1933-06-23, issued 1936-02-25, http://www.google.de/patents/about?id=lixMAAAAEBAJ. &quot;Photoelectric cell circuit&quot;, US patent RE20823, filed 1933-06-23, issued 1938-08-09, http://www.google.de/patents/about?id=724CAAAAEBAJ --&gt;

The company tested and frequently published speed ratings for most films of the time. Weston film speed ratings could since be found on most Weston exposure meters and were sometimes referred to by film manufactures and third parties&lt;ref name=&quot;Hefley_1951_micrographs&quot;/&gt; in their exposure guidelines. Since manufactures were sometimes creative about film speeds, the company went as far as to warn users about unauthorized uses of their film ratings in their &quot;Weston film ratings&quot; booklets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weston_1946_Ratings&quot;/&gt;

The Weston Cadet (model 852 introduced in 1949), Direct Reading (model 853 introduced 1954) and Master III (models 737 and S141.3 introduced in 1956) were the first in their line of exposure meters to switch and utilize the meanwhile established [[#ASA|ASA]] scale instead. Other models used the original Weston scale up until ca. 1955. The company continued to publish Weston film ratings after 1955,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sangamo_1959_Weston-Ratings&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- TBD: Did Weston also publish ratings after the ASA PH2.5-1960 changes? --&gt; but while their recommended values often differed slightly from the ASA film speeds found on film boxes, these newer Weston values were based on the ASA system and had to be converted for use with older Weston meters by subtracting 1/3 exposure stop as per Weston's recommendation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sangamo_1959_Weston-Ratings&quot;/&gt; Vice versa, &quot;old&quot; Weston film speed ratings could be converted into &quot;new&quot; Westons and the ASA scale by adding the same amount, that is, a film rating of 100 Weston (up to 1955) corresponded with 125 ASA (as per ASA PH2.5-1954 and before). This conversion was not necessary on Weston meters manufactured and Weston film ratings published since 1956 due to their inherent use of the ASA system;&lt;!-- temporary sentence follows: --&gt; however the changes of the ASA PH2.5-1960 revision may be taken into account when comparing with newer ASA or ISO values.&lt;!-- Comparing historical black-and-white negative film speeds given in old Westons with newer ASA values (as per ASA PH2.5-1960) or [[#ISO|ISO]] film speeds may require to add another full exposure stop to the effect of actually adding 1.3 EV to that Weston value in order to find the ISO/ASA equivalent.--&gt;&lt;!-- TBD: In order to prove this statement it would be most interesting to learn about Weston speed ratings published after the ASA PH2.5-1960 revision, if they exist. --&gt;

====General Electric{{anchor|GE|General Electric film values}}====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#GE&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
Prior to the establishment of the ASA scale&lt;ref name=&quot;General-Electric_194x_GES-2810_Manual_GW-68&quot;/&gt; and similar to [[#Weston|Weston film speed ratings]] another manufacturer of photo-electric exposure meters, [[General Electric]], developed its own rating system of so-called ''General Electric film values'' (often abbreviated as ''G-E'' or ''GE'') around 1937.&lt;!-- The exposure meter GW-47 is dated 1937 and has GE &quot;film value&quot; scale. --&gt;

Film speed values for use with their meters were published in regularly updated ''General Electric Film Values''&lt;ref name=&quot;General-Electric_1947_GED-744_Film-Values&quot;/&gt; leaflets and in the ''General Electric Photo Data Book''.&lt;ref name=&quot;General-Electric_1942_GET-I717&quot;/&gt;

General Electric switched to use the [[#ASA|ASA]] scale in 1946. Meters manufactured since February 1946 were equipped with the ASA scale (labeled &quot;Exposure Index&quot;) already. For some of the older meters with scales in &quot;Film Speed&quot; or &quot;Film Value&quot; (e.g. models DW-48, DW-49 as well as early DW-58 and GW-68 variants), replaceable hoods with ASA scales were available from the manufacturer.&lt;ref name=&quot;General-Electric_1947_GED-744_Film-Values&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;General-Electric_1946_Ad_Hood&quot;/&gt; The company continued to publish recommended film values after that date, however, they were now aligned to the ASA scale.

====ASA{{anchor|APEX|ASA PH2.5|ASA Z38.2.1}}====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#ASA&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
Based on earlier research work by [[Loyd A. Jones|Loyd Ancile Jones]] (1884–1954) of [[Kodak]]&lt;!-- TBD: Original name of Kodak system was &quot;Kodak speed&quot; since 1939 --&gt; and inspired by the systems of [[#Weston|Weston film speed ratings]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sangamo_1959_Weston-Ratings&quot;/&gt; and [[#GE|General Electric film values]],&lt;ref name=&quot;General-Electric_1947_GED-744_Film-Values&quot;/&gt; the [[American Standards Association]] (now named [[ANSI]]) defined a new method to determine and specify film speeds of black-and-white negative films in 1943. ASA Z38.2.1-1943 was revised in 1946 and 1947 before the standard grew into ASA PH2.5-1954. Originally, ASA values were frequently referred to as ''American standard speed numbers'' or ''ASA exposure-index numbers''. (See also: [[#EI|Exposure Index]] (EI).)

The ASA scale was arithmetic, that is, a film denoted as having a film speed of 200 ASA was twice as fast as a film with 100 ASA.

The ASA standard underwent a major revision in 1960 with ASA PH2.5-1960, when the method to determine film speed was refined and previously applied safety factors against under-exposure were abandoned, effectively doubling the nominal speed of many black-and-white negative films. For example, an [[Ilford HP|Ilford HP3]] that had been rated at 200 ASA before 1960 was labeled 400 ASA afterwards without any change to the emulsion. Similar changes were applied to the [[#DIN|DIN]] system with DIN 4512:1961-10 and the BS system with BS 1380:1963 in the following years.

In addition to the established arithmetic speed scale, ASA PH2.5-1960 also introduced logarithmic ASA grades (100 ASA = 5° ASA), where a difference of 1° ASA represented a full exposure stop and therefore the doubling of a film speed. For some while, ASA grades were also printed on film boxes, and they saw life in the form of the [[APEX system|APEX]] speed value ''S&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' (without degree symbol) as well.

ASA PH2.5-1960 was revised as ANSI PH2.5-1979, without the logarithmic speeds, and later replaced by NAPM IT2.5-1986 of the National Association of Photographic Manufacturers, which represented the US adoption of the international standard ISO&amp;nbsp;6. The latest issue of ANSI/NAPM IT2.5 was published in 1993.

The standard for color negative film was introduced as ASA PH2.27-1965 and saw a string of revisions in 1971, 1976, 1979 and 1981, before it finally became ANSI IT2.27-1988 prior to its withdrawal.

Color reversal film speeds were defined in ANSI PH2.21-1983, which was revised in 1989 before it became ANSI/NAPM IT2.21 in 1994, the US adoption of the ISO&amp;nbsp;2240 standard.

On an international level, the ASA system was superseded by the [[#ISO|ISO]] film speed system between 1982 and 1987, however, the arithmetic ASA speed scale continued to live on as the linear speed value of the ISO system.

====GOST{{anchor|GOST 2817|GOST 10691}}====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#GOST&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
''{{lang|ru-Latn|[[GOST]]}}'' (Cyrillic: ''{{lang|ru-Cyrl|ГОСТ}}'') was an arithmetic film speed scale defined in GOST 2817-45 and GOST 2817-50.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorokhovskiy_1970_Metrologiya&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GOST_2817-50&quot;/&gt; It was used in the former [[Soviet Union]] since October 1951,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- TBD: Why not earlier when GOST 2817-45 was defined earlier? --&gt; replacing [[#H&amp;D|Hurter &amp; Driffield]] (H&amp;D, Cyrillic: ХиД) numbers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorokhovskiy_1970_Metrologiya&quot;/&gt; which had been used since 1928.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

GOST 2817-50 was similar to the [[#ASA|ASA]] standard, having been based on a speed point at a density 0.2 above base plus fog, as opposed to the ASA's 0.1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stroebel_1993_Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; GOST markings are only found on pre-1987 photographic equipment (film, cameras, [[Light meter|lightmeters]], etc.) of Soviet Union manufacture.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZENIT_2011_GOST&quot;/&gt;

On 1 January 1987, the GOST scale was realigned to the [[#ISO|ISO]] scale with GOST 10691-84,&lt;ref name=&quot;GOST_10691-84&quot;/&gt;

This evolved into multiple parts including GOST 10691.6-88&lt;ref name=&quot;GOST_10691.6-88&quot;/&gt; and GOST 10691.5-88,&lt;ref name=&quot;GOST_10691.5-88&quot;/&gt; which both became functional on 1 January 1991.&lt;!-- also found &quot;GOST 10691-63&quot; and various other GOST 10691.x-xx variants. --&gt;

===Current system: ISO{{anchor|ISO|ISO 6|ISO 2240|ISO 5800|Current ISO system}}===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#ISO&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
The [[#ASA|ASA]] and [[#DIN|DIN]] film speed standards have been combined into the ISO standards since 1974.

The current [[International standard|International Standard]] for measuring the speed of [[color print film|color negative film]] is ISO 5800:2001&lt;ref name=&quot;iso.org&quot;/&gt; (first published in 1979, revised in November 1987) from the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). Related standards ISO 6:1993&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_6&quot;/&gt; (first published in 1974) and ISO 2240:2003&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt; (first published in July 1982, revised in September 1994, and corrected in October 2003) define scales for speeds of black-and-white negative film and color reversal film, respectively.

The determination of ISO speeds [[#ISO 12232|with digital still-cameras]] is described in ISO 12232:2006 (first published in August 1998, revised in April 2006, and corrected in October 2006).

The ISO system defines both an [[arithmetic]] and a [[logarithmic scale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot;/&gt; The arithmetic ISO scale corresponds to the arithmetic ASA system, where a doubling of film sensitivity is represented by a doubling of the numerical film speed value. In the logarithmic ISO scale, which corresponds to the DIN scale, adding 3° to the numerical value constitutes a doubling of sensitivity. For example, a film rated ISO&amp;nbsp;200/24° is twice as sensitive as one rated ISO&amp;nbsp;100/21°.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt;

Commonly, the logarithmic speed is omitted; for example, &quot;ISO 100&quot; denotes &quot;ISO 100/21°&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Graves_1996_Zone-system&quot;/&gt; while logarithmic ISO speeds are written as &quot;ISO 21°&quot; as per the standard.

===Conversion between current scales{{anchor|Conversion}}===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#Conversion&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
Conversion from arithmetic speed ''S'' to logarithmic speed ''S''° is given by&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO_6&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S^\circ = 10 \log S + 1&lt;/math&gt;

and rounding to the nearest integer; the log is base 10. Conversion from logarithmic speed to arithmetic speed is given by&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO-2721_1982&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S = 10^{\left( {S^\circ - 1} \right)/10}&lt;/math&gt;

Table notes:
# Speeds shown in bold under APEX, ISO and ASA are values actually assigned in speed standards from the respective agencies; other values are calculated extensions to assigned speeds using the same progressions as for the assigned speeds.
# APEX ''S&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' values 1 to 10 correspond with logarithmic ASA grades 1° to 10° found in ASA PH2.5-1960.
# ASA arithmetic speeds from 4 to 5 are taken from ANSI PH2.21-1979 (Table&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;8).
# ASA arithmetic speeds from 6 to 3200 are taken from ANSI PH2.5-1979 (Table&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;5) and ANSI PH2.27-1979.
# ISO arithmetic speeds from 4 to 3200 are taken from ISO 5800:1987 (Table &quot;ISO speed scales&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;4).
# ISO arithmetic speeds from 6 to 10000 are taken from ISO 12232:1998 (Table&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;9).
# ISO 12232:1998 does not specify speeds greater than 10000. However, the upper limit for ''S''&lt;sub&gt;noise&lt;/sub&gt; 10000 is given as 12500, suggesting that ISO may have envisioned a progression of 12500, 25000, 50000, and 100000, similar to that from 1250 to 10000. This is consistent with ASA PH2.12-1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASA_1961_PH2-12_12500&quot;/&gt; For digital cameras, Nikon, Canon, Sony, Pentax, and Fujifilm apparently chose to express the greater speeds in an exact power-of-2 progression from the highest previously realized speed (6400) rather than rounding to an extension of the existing progression.
# Most of the modern [[35 mm film]] SLRs support an automatic film speed range from ISO 25/15° to 5000/38° with [[DX encoding|DX-coded films]], or ISO 6/9° to 6400/39° manually (without utilizing [[exposure compensation]]). The film speed range with support for [[Through-the-lens metering#Through the lens flash metering|TTL flash]] is smaller, typically ISO 12/12° to 3200/36° or less.
# The Booster&lt;ref name=&quot;Canon_1966_Booster&quot;/&gt; accessory for the [[Canon Pellix QL]] (1965) and [[Canon FT QL]] (1966) supported film speeds from 25 to 12800 ASA.

# The [[Leica R8]] (1996) and [[Leica R9|R9]] (2002) officially supported film speeds of 8000/40°, 10000/41° and 12800/42° (in the case of the R8) or 12500/42° (in the case of the R9), and utilizing its ±3 EV exposure compensation the range could be extended from ISO 0.8/0° to ISO 100000/51° in half exposure steps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leica_2002_ISO_R9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leica_1996_ISO_R8&quot;/&gt;

===Determining film speed===
[[Image:ISO6speedMethod.png|thumb|540px|right|ISO 6:1993 method of determining speed for black-and-white film.]]

Film speed is found from a plot of [[optical density]] vs. log of exposure for the film, known as the ''D''–log ''H'' curve or [[sensitometry|Hurter–Driffield]] curve. There typically are five regions in the curve: the base + fog, the toe, the linear region, the shoulder, and the overexposed region. For [[black-and-white]] [[negative film]], the “speed point” m is the point on the curve where density exceeds the base + fog density by 0.1 when the negative is developed so that a point n where the log of exposure is 1.3 units greater than the exposure at point m has a density 0.8 greater than the density at point m. The exposure ''H''&lt;sub style=&quot;font-size: 70%'&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, in [[Lux second|lux-s]], is that for point m when the specified contrast condition is satisfied. The ISO arithmetic speed is determined from:

:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac {0.8\;\text{lx⋅s}} {H_\mathrm{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

This value is then rounded to the nearest standard speed in Table&amp;nbsp;1 of ISO 6:1993.

Determining speed for color negative film is similar in concept but more complex because it involves separate curves for blue, green, and red. The film is processed according to the film manufacturer’s recommendations rather than to a specified contrast. ISO speed for [[color reversal film]] is determined from the middle rather than the threshold of the curve; it again involves separate curves for blue, green, and red, and the film is processed according to the film manufacturer’s recommendations.

===Applying film speed===
Film speed is used in the [[Light meter#Exposure equations|exposure equations]] to find the appropriate exposure parameters. Four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect: [[lighting]], film speed, [[f-number]] (aperture size), and [[shutter speed]] (exposure time). The equation may be expressed as ratios, or, by taking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides, by addition, using the APEX system, in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure; this increment is commonly known as a &quot;stop&quot;. The [[F-number#Working f-number|effective f-number]] is proportional to the ratio between the lens [[focal length]] and [[aperture]] diameter, the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area. Thus, a lens set to {{f/|1.4|link=yes}} allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to {{f/}}2. Therefore, each f-number factor of the square root of two (approximately 1.4) is also a stop, so lenses are typically marked in that progression: {{f/}}1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, etc.

The ISO arithmetic speed has a useful property for photographers without the equipment for taking a metered light reading. Correct exposure will usually be achieved for a frontlighted scene in bright sun if the aperture of the lens is set to f/16 and the shutter speed is the reciprocal of the ISO film speed (e.g. 1/100 second for 100 ISO film). This known as the [[sunny 16 rule]].

===Exposure index{{anchor|EI}}===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#EI&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
Exposure index, or EI, refers to speed rating assigned to a particular film and shooting situation in variance to the film's actual speed. It is used to compensate for equipment calibration inaccuracies or process variables, or to achieve certain effects. The exposure index may simply be called the ''speed setting'', as compared to the speed ''rating''.

For example, a photographer may rate an ISO 400 film at EI 800 and then use [[push processing]] to obtain printable negatives in low-light conditions. The film has been exposed at EI 800.

Another example occurs where a camera's [[shutter (photography)|shutter]] is miscalibrated and consistently overexposes or underexposes the film; similarly, a [[light meter]] may be inaccurate. One may adjust the EI rating accordingly in order to compensate for these defects and consistently produce correctly exposed negatives. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Reciprocity==
Upon exposure, the amount of light energy that reaches the film determines the effect upon the emulsion. If the brightness of the light is multiplied by a factor and the exposure of the film decreased by the same factor by varying the camera's [[shutter speed]] and aperture, so that the energy received is the same, the film will be developed to the same density. This rule is called [[reciprocity (photography)|reciprocity]]. The systems for determining the sensitivity for an emulsion are possible because reciprocity holds. In practice, reciprocity works reasonably well for normal photographic films for the range of exposures between 1/1000&amp;nbsp;second to 1/2&amp;nbsp;second. However, this relationship breaks down outside these limits, a phenomenon known as [[Reciprocity (photography)#Reciprocity failure|reciprocity failure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambrecht_2003_Way-Beyond&quot;/&gt;

==Film sensitivity and grain==
{{Main|Film grain}}
[[Image:Korn HP4 ISO1600.jpg|thumb|Grainy high-speed B&amp;W film negative]]
The size of [[silver halide]] grains in the [[emulsion]] affects film sensitivity, which is related to [[film grain|granularity]] because larger grains give film greater sensitivity to light. Fine-grain film, such as film designed for portraiture or copying [[original camera negative]]s, is relatively insensitive, or &quot;slow&quot;, because it requires brighter light or a longer exposure than a &quot;fast&quot; film. Fast films, used for photographing in low light or capturing high-speed motion, produce comparatively grainy images.

[[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] has defined a &quot;Print Grain Index&quot; (PGI) to characterize film grain (color negative films only), based on perceptual [[just-noticeable difference]] of graininess in prints. They also define &quot;granularity&quot;, a measurement of grain using an RMS measurement of density fluctuations in uniformly exposed film, measured with a microdensitometer with 48 micrometre aperture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kodak_2000_Print-Grain-Index&quot;/&gt; Granularity varies with exposure — underexposed film looks grainier than overexposed film.

===Marketing anomalies===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from several places inside this article. Do not remove or rename this section heading without also updating the links. --&gt;
Some high-speed black-and-white films, such as [[Ilford Delta]]&amp;nbsp;3200 and [[Kodak T-MAX]]&amp;nbsp;P3200, are marketed with film speeds in excess of their true ISO speed as determined using the ISO testing method. For example, the Ilford product is actually an ISO 1000 film, according to its data sheet. The manufacturers do not indicate that the 3200 number is an ISO rating on their packaging.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ilford_2006_Delta-3200&quot;/&gt; Kodak and Fuji also marketed E6 films designed for pushing (hence the &quot;P&quot; prefix), such as Ektachrome P800/1600 and Fujichrome P1600, both with a base speed of ISO 400.

==Digital camera ISO speed and exposure index{{anchor|Digital|ISO speed}}==

[[Image:CCD Image sensor.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] image sensor, 2/3 inch size]]
In [[Digital camera|digital camera systems]], an arbitrary relationship between exposure and sensor data values can be achieved by setting the [[signal gain]] of the sensor. The relationship between the sensor data values and the lightness of the finished image is also arbitrary, depending on the parameters chosen for the interpretation of the sensor data into an image [[color space]] such as [[sRGB]].

For digital photo cameras (&quot;digital still cameras&quot;), an [[#EI|exposure index]] (EI) rating—commonly called ''ISO'' setting—is specified by the manufacturer such that the sRGB image files produced by the camera will have a lightness similar to what would be obtained with film of the same EI rating at the same exposure. The usual design is that the camera's parameters for interpreting the sensor data values into sRGB values are fixed, and a number of different EI choices are accommodated by varying the sensor's signal gain in the analog realm, prior to conversion to digital. Some camera designs provide at least some EI choices by adjusting the sensor's signal gain in the digital realm. A few camera designs also provide EI adjustment through a choice of lightness parameters for the interpretation of sensor data values into sRGB; this variation allows different tradeoffs between the range of highlights that can be captured and the amount of noise introduced into the shadow areas of the photo.

Digital cameras have far surpassed film in terms of sensitivity to light, with [[#ISO|ISO]] equivalent speeds of up to 409,600, a number that is unfathomable in the realm of conventional film photography. Faster processors, as well as advances in software noise reduction techniques allow this type of processing to be executed the moment the photo is captured, allowing photographers to store images that have a higher level of refinement and would have been prohibitively time consuming to process with earlier generations of digital camera hardware.

===The ISO 12232:2006 standard{{anchor|ISO 12232}}===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#ISO 12232&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
The ISO standard ISO 12232:2006&lt;ref name=&quot;iso12232&quot;/&gt; gives digital still camera manufacturers a choice of five different techniques for determining the exposure index rating at each sensitivity setting provided by a particular camera model. Three of the techniques in ISO 12232:2006 are carried over from the 1998 version of the standard, while two new techniques allowing for measurement of JPEG output files are introduced from [[Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association|CIPA]] DC-004.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIPA_DC-004&quot;/&gt; Depending on the technique selected, the exposure index rating can depend on the sensor sensitivity, the sensor noise, and the appearance of the resulting image. The standard specifies the measurement of light sensitivity of the entire digital camera system and not of individual components such as digital sensors, although Kodak has reported&lt;ref name=&quot;Kodak_Sensor_ISO&quot;/&gt; using a variation to characterize the sensitivity of two of their sensors in 2001.

The ''Recommended Exposure Index'' (REI) technique, new in the 2006 version of the standard, allows the manufacturer to specify a camera model’s [[#EI|EI]] choices arbitrarily. The choices are based solely on the manufacturer’s opinion of what EI values produce well-exposed [[sRGB]] images at the various sensor sensitivity settings. This is the only technique available under the standard for output formats that are not in the sRGB color space. This is also the only technique available under the standard when [[Metering mode#Multi-zone metering|multi-zone metering]] (also called ''pattern'' metering) is used.

The ''Standard Output Sensitivity'' (SOS) technique, also new in the 2006 version of the standard, effectively specifies that the average level in the sRGB image must be 18% gray plus or minus 1/3 stop when the exposure is controlled by an automatic exposure control system calibrated per [[Light Meter|ISO 2721]] and set to the EI with no [[exposure compensation]]. Because the output level is measured in the sRGB output from the camera, it is only applicable to sRGB {{nowrap|images—typically}} [[JPEG]]—and not to output files in [[raw image format]]. It is not applicable when multi-zone metering is used.

The CIPA DC-004 standard requires that Japanese manufacturers of digital still cameras use either the REI or SOS techniques, and DC-008&lt;ref name=&quot;CIPA_DC-008&quot;/&gt; updates the [[Exchangeable image file format|Exif]] specification to differentiate between these values. Consequently, the three EI techniques carried over from ISO 12232:1998 are not widely used in recent camera models (approximately 2007 and later). As those earlier techniques did not allow for measurement from images produced with [[lossy compression]], they cannot be used at all on cameras that produce images only in JPEG format.

The ''saturation-based'' technique is closely related to the SOS technique, with the sRGB output level being measured at 100% white rather than 18% gray. The SOS value is effectively 0.704 times the saturation-based value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerr_2007_Digital-Camera-Sensitivity&quot;/&gt; Because the output level is measured in the [[sRGB]] output from the camera, it is only applicable to sRGB images—typically [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]]—and not to output files in raw image format. It is not applicable when multi-zone metering is used.

The two ''noise-based'' techniques have rarely been used for consumer digital still cameras. These techniques specify the highest EI that can be used while still providing either an “excellent” picture or a “usable” picture depending on the technique chosen.

===Measurements and calculations===
ISO speed ratings of a digital camera are based on the properties of the sensor and the image processing done in the camera, and are expressed in terms of the luminous exposure ''H'' (in [[lux]] [[second]]s) arriving at the sensor. For a typical camera lens with an effective [[focal length]] ''f'' that is much smaller than the distance between the camera and the photographed scene, ''H'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{q L t}{N^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L'' is the [[luminance]] of the scene (in [[candela]] per [[metre|m]]²), ''t'' is the exposure time (in seconds), ''N'' is the aperture f-number, and
:&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{\pi}{4} T\, v(\theta)\, \cos^4\theta&lt;/math&gt;
is a factor depending on the [[transmittance]] ''T'' of the lens, the [[vignetting]] factor ''v''(''θ''), and the angle ''θ'' relative to the axis of the lens. A typical value is ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.65, based on ''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10°, ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.9, and ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.98.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO-12232_1998&quot;/&gt;

====Saturation-based speed====
The ''saturation-based speed'' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{sat}} = \frac{78\;\text{lx⋅s}}{H_{\mathrm{sat}}},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum possible exposure that does not lead to a clipped or bloomed camera output. Typically, the lower limit of the saturation speed is determined by the sensor itself, but with the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of the amplifier between the sensor and the [[analog-to-digital converter]], the saturation speed can be increased. The factor 78 is chosen such that exposure settings based on a standard [[light meter]] and an 18-percent reflective surface will result in an image with a grey level of 18%/√2 = 12.7% of saturation. The factor √2 indicates that there is half a stop of headroom to deal with [[specular reflection]]s that would appear brighter than a 100% reflecting white surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;iso12232&quot;/&gt;

====Noise-based speed====
{{main|Signal to noise ratio (imaging)}}[[File:ISO.gif|thumb|Digital noise at 3200 ISO vs. 100 ISO]]
The ''noise-based speed'' is defined as the exposure that will lead to a given [[signal-to-noise ratio]] on individual [[pixel]]s. Two ratios are used, the 40:1 (&quot;excellent image quality&quot;) and the 10:1 (&quot;acceptable image quality&quot;) ratio. These ratios have been subjectively determined based on a resolution of 70 pixels per cm (178 DPI) when viewed at 25&amp;nbsp;cm (9.8&amp;nbsp;inch) distance. The signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the [[standard deviation]] of a weighted average of the [[luminance]] and color of individual pixels. The noise-based speed is mostly determined by the properties of the sensor and somewhat affected by the noise in the electronic gain and AD converter.&lt;ref name=&quot;iso12232&quot;/&gt;

====Standard output sensitivity (SOS){{anchor|SOS}}====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from inside or outside this article, preferable by &quot;#SOS&quot;. Do not rename without keeping in sync. --&gt;
In addition to the above speed ratings, the standard also defines the ''standard output sensitivity'' (SOS), how the exposure is related to the digital pixel values in the output image. It is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{sos}} = \frac{10\;\text{lx⋅s}}{H_{\mathrm{sos}}},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{sos}}&lt;/math&gt; is the exposure that will lead to values of 118 in 8-bit pixels, which is 18 percent of the saturation value in images encoded as [[sRGB]] or with [[gamma correction|gamma]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;iso12232&quot;/&gt;

====Discussion====
The standard specifies how speed ratings should be reported by the camera. If the noise-based speed (40:1) is ''higher'' than the saturation-based speed, the noise-based speed should be reported, rounded ''downwards'' to a standard value (e.g. 200, 250, 320, or 400). The rationale is that exposure according to the lower saturation-based speed would not result in a visibly better image. In addition, an exposure latitude can be specified, ranging from the saturation-based speed to the 10:1 noise-based speed. If the noise-based speed (40:1) is ''lower'' than the saturation-based speed, or undefined because of high noise, the saturation-based speed is specified, rounded upwards to a standard value, because using the noise-based speed would lead to overexposed images. The camera may also report the SOS-based speed (explicitly as being an SOS speed), rounded to the nearest standard speed rating.&lt;ref name=&quot;iso12232&quot;/&gt;

For example, a camera sensor may have the following properties: &lt;math&gt;S_{40:1}=107&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{10:1}=1688&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{sat}}=49&lt;/math&gt;. According to the standard, the camera should report its sensitivity as
:''ISO 100 (daylight)''
:''ISO speed latitude 50–1600''
:''ISO 100 (SOS, daylight)''.
The SOS rating could be user controlled. For a different camera with a noisier sensor, the properties might be &lt;math&gt;S_{40:1}=40&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{10:1}=800&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{sat}}=200&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the camera should report
:''ISO 200 (daylight)'',
as well as a user-adjustable SOS value. In all cases, the camera should indicate for the white balance setting for which the speed rating applies, such as daylight or tungsten ([[incandescent light]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;iso12232&quot;/&gt;

Despite these detailed standard definitions, cameras typically do not clearly indicate whether the user &quot;ISO&quot; setting refers to the noise-based speed, saturation-based speed, or the specified output sensitivity, or even some made-up number for marketing purposes. Because the 1998 version of ISO 12232 did not permit measurement of camera output that had lossy compression, it was not possible to correctly apply any of those measurements to cameras that did not produce [[sRGB]] files in an uncompressed format such as [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]]. Following the publication of CIPA DC-004 in 2006, Japanese manufacturers of digital still cameras are required to specify whether a sensitivity rating is REI or SOS.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

As should be clear from the above, a greater SOS setting for a given sensor comes with some loss of image quality, just like with analog film. However, this loss is visible as image noise rather than [[film grain|grain]]. Current (January 2010) APS and 35mm sized digital [[image sensors]], both CMOS and CCD based, do not produce significant noise until about ''ISO 1600''.&lt;ref name=D200&gt;{{cite web|title=D200 Users manual|url=http://cdn-10.nikon-cdn.com/pdf/manuals/dslr/D200_en.pdf|publisher=Nikon|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This speed was no fixed quantity, and the expression consequently meant but little. [[#Warnerke|Warnerke]] introduced a sensitometer, consisting of a series of numbered squares with increasing quantities of opaque pigment. The plate to be tested was placed in contact with this, and an exposure made to light emanating from a tablet of luminous paint, excited by burning magnesium ribbon. After development and fixation the last number visible was taken as the speed of the plate. The chief objections to this method were that practically no two numbered tablets agreed, that the pigment possessed selective spectral absorption, and that the luminosity of the tablet varied considerably with the lapse of time between its excitation and the exposure of the plate. […] [[Henry Chapman Jones|Chapman Jones]] has introduced a modified Warnerke tablet containing a series of twenty-five graduated densities, a series of coloured squares, and a strip of neutral grey, all five being of approximately equal luminosity, and a series of four squares passing a definite portion of the spectrum; finally, there is a square of a line design, over which is superposed a half-tone negative. This “plate tester,” […] is used with a standard candle as the source of light, and is useful for rough tests of both plates and printing papers.’&lt;/ref&gt;

([http://www.archive.org/details/bookofphotograph00hasl]): “THE CHAPMAN JONES PLATE TESTER. A convenient means of testing the colour rendering and other properties of a sensitive plate, or for ascertaining the effect of various colour screens, is afforded by the plate tester devised by Mr. [[Henry Chapman Jones|Chapman Jones]] in 1900. This consists of a number of graduated squares by which the sensitiveness and range of gradation of the plate examined may be determined; a series of squares of different colours and mixtures of colours of equal visual intensity, which will indicate the colour sensitiveness; and a strip of uncoloured space for comparison purposes. It is simply necessary to expose the plate being tested, in contact with the screen, to the light of a standard candle. A suitable frame and stand are supplied for the purpose; any other light may, however, be used if desired. The plate is then developed, when an examination of the negative will yield the desired information. The idea of the coloured squares is based on that of the [[William de Wiveleslie Abney|Abney]] Colour Sensitometer, where three or four squares of coloured and one of uncoloured glass are brought to an equal visual intensity by backing where necessary with squares of exposed celluloid film developed to suitable density.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Die Konstante der geometrischen Folge war so gewählt, dass der letzte Winkel 100 mal größer als der erste war. Die Konstante entsprach somit der neunzehnten Wurzel aus 100, also ungefähr 1,274… Eine genormte Lichtquelle beleuchtete die Scheibe aus einer ganz bestimmten Distanz. Hinter der Scheibe war eine Kassette angebracht […], die das zu prüfende Material aufnahm. Diese Kassette wurde genau eine Minute lang geöffnet, während der die Scheibe rotierte. Die Nummer des ersten Ringes, von innen nach außen gezählt, hinter dem das Material nach der Entwicklung eine minimale, genau festgelegte Schwärzung aufwies, bestimmte den Empfindlichkeitsgrad in Scheinergraden des zu prüfenden Materials. Der letzte Grad dieser Skala (die später auf höhere Empfindlichkeitsgrade erweitert werden sollte), der Grad 20, entsprach einer 100 mal höheren Empfindlichkeit als der erste. Ein Unterschied von 3º Scheiner entspricht annähernd einer doppelten Empfindlichkeit, da die dritte Potenz der neunzehnten Wurzel von 100, nämlich 2,069…, eine Annäherung an die Zahl 2 bildet.“ On the DIN system he writes: „Die Empfindlichkeitsmessung im DIN-System beruht auf der Belichtung der Materialien durch einen Stufengraukeil mit einer Konstante, die so beschaffen ist, dass ihr Dreifaches dem Zehnerlogarithmus von 2 gleich ist. Diese Konstante ist also eine gute Annäherung an 0,1. Die erste Zone unter dem Graukeil, dessen Dichte sich nach dem Entwickeln des Materials um mindestens 0,1 vom unbelichteten Material unterscheidet, bestimmt dessen Empfindlichkeit. Die Belichtung erfolgt mit einem genormten Licht, das sich durch eine gewisse Annäherung an die spektrale Zusammensetzung des Tageslichts auszeichnet, was beim Scheiner-System nicht der Fall war. Die Belichtungszeit wird durch einen Schwerkraftverschluss bestimmt“. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

''Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers''. Volume XVIII, Number 2 (February 1932), pp.&amp;nbsp;232-242 ([http://www.archive.org/details/journalofsociety18socirich]): ‘[…] The 8th International Congress of Photography was held at Dresden, Germany, from August 3 to 8, 1931, inclusive. […] In regard to sensitometric standardization, several important developments occurred. First, the other national committees on sensitometric standardization accepted the light source and filter proposed by the American Committee at Paris, 1925, and accepted by the British in 1928. In the meantime, no definite agreement had been reached, nor indeed had very definite proposals been made on the subjects of sensitometers or exposure meters, development, density measurement, and methods of expressing sensitometric results, although much discussion and controversy on this subject had taken place. At the present Congress, a body of recommendations for sensitometric standards was put forward by the Deutschen&lt;!-- sic --&gt; Normenausschusses&lt;!-- sic --&gt; fur&lt;!-- sic --&gt; Phototechnik, which endeavored to cover the latter questions and bring the subject of sensitometric standardization into the industrial field. It was stated by the German committee that this action had been forced on them by difficulties arising from indiscriminate and uncontrolled placing of speed numbers on photographic sensitive goods, a situation which was summarized at the Congress by the term “[[#Scheiner|Scheiner]]-inflation.”
The gist of these recommendations was as follows:
(a) Acceptance of the light source and daylight filter as proposed by the American commission.
(b) As exposure meter, a density step-wedge combined with a drop shutter accurate to 1/20&lt;!-- difficult to decipher --&gt; second.
(c) Brush development in a tray with a prescribed solution of metol-hydroquinone according to a so-called “optimal” development.
(d) Expression of the sensitivity by that illumination at which a density of 0.1 in excess of fog is reached.
(e) Density measurement shall be carried out in diffused light according to details to be discussed later.
These proposals aroused a very lively discussion. The American and the British delegations criticized the proposals both as a whole and in detail. As a whole they considered that the time was not ripe for application of sensitometric standards to industrial usage. In matters of detail they criticized the proposed employment of a step-wedge, and the particular sensitivity number proposed. The latter approaches very roughly the idea of an exposure for minimum gradient, but even such a number is not adequate for certain photographic uses of certain materials.
The upshot of the discussion was that the German proposals in somewhat modified form are to be submitted simply as proposals of the German committee for sensitometric standardization to the various national committees for definite expression of opinion within six months of the expiration of the Congress. Further, in case of general approval of these recommendations by the other national committees, that a small International Committee on Sensitometric Standardization shall, within a further period of six months, work out a body of sensitometric practices for commercial usage.
In this connection it should be noted that it was agreed that both the lamps and filters and exposure meters should be certified as within certain tolerances by the national testing laboratories of the countries in question. […]’&lt;/ref&gt;

Auf den Internationalen Kongressen in Paris 1925 und London 1928 sind diese Fragen schon eingehend behandelt und in einzelnen Punkten genaue Vorschläge gemacht worden. Die Farbtemperatur der Lichtquelle soll 2360° betragen. Vor dieselbe soll ein Tageslichtfilter, welches vom Bureau of Standards ausgearbeitet worden ist, geschaltet werden. Herr Luther hat an der Filterflüssigkeit durch eigene Versuche gewisse Verbesserungen erzielt. Schwierigkeiten bereitet die Konstanthaltung der Farbtemperatur bei Nitralampen. Herr Pirani schlug deshalb in seinem Vortrag die Verwendung von Glimmlampen vor, deren Farbe von der Stromstärke weitgehend unabhängig ist. In der Frage: Zeit- oder Intensitätsskala befürworten die Herren Luther und Lehmann die Intensitätsskala. Herr Lehmann behandelte einige Fragen, die mit der Herstellung der Intensitätsskala zusammenhängen. Ausführlicher wurde noch die Auswertung (zahlenmäßige Angabe der Empfindlichkeit und Gradation) besprochen, die eine der wichtigsten Fragen der Sensitometrie darstellt. In der Diskussion wurde betont, daß es zunächst nicht so sehr auf eine wissenschaftlich erschöpfende Auswertung ankomme als darauf, daß die Empfindlichkeit der Materialien in möglichst einfacher, aber eindeutiger und für den Praktiker ausreichender Weise charakterisiert wird.

General Electric publication code GED-744, Booklet, 12 pages, ([http://www.cameramanuals.org/flashes_meters/film_values.pdf]): “This General Electric Film Value Booklet contains the […] exposure-index numbers for […] photographic films in accordance with the new system for rating photographic films that has been devised by the American Standards Association.
This system has been under development for several years and is the result of co-operative effort on the part of all the film manufacturers, meter manufacturers, the Optical Society of America, and the Bureau of Standards. It was used by all of the military services during the war. The new ASA exposure-index numbers provide the photographer with the most accurate film-rating information that has yet been devised.
The G-E exposure meter uses the ASA exposure-index numbers, not only in the interest of standardization, but also because this system represents a real advancement in the field of measurement.
The exposure-index number have been so arranged that all earlier model G-E meters can be used with this series of numbers. For some films the values are exactly the same; and where differences exist, the new ASA exposure-index value will cause but a slight increase in exposure. However […] a comparison of the new ASA exposure-index numbers and the G-E film values is shown […] A complete comparison of all systems of emulsion speed values can be found in the G-E Photo Data Book. […]
All G-E meters manufactured after January, 1946, utilize the ASA exposure indexes. Although the new ASA values can be used with all previous model G-E meters, interchangeable calculator-hoods with ASA exposure indexes are available for Types DW-48, DW-49, and DW-58 meters.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''signal-to-noise ratio''' ('''SNR''') is used in imaging as a physical measure of the [[sensitometry|sensitivity]] of a [[photography|(digital or film) imaging system]]. Industry standards measure '''SNR''' in [[decibels]] (dB) of [[power (physics)|power]] and therefore apply the [[10 log rule]] to the &quot;pure&quot; '''SNR''' ''ratio'' (a ratio of 1:1 yields 0 decibels, for instance). In turn, yielding the &quot;sensitivity.&quot; Industry standards measure and define sensitivity in terms of the [[Film speed|ISO film speed]] equivalent; SNR:32.04 dB = excellent image quality and SNR:20 dB = acceptable image quality.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 12232: 1997  Photography – Electronic Still Picture Cameras – Determining ISO Speed here&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of SNR==
[[Image:SiTF Half Moon Target.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An operator arbitrarily defines a box area in the signal and background regions of a back-illuminated '''half moon''' or '''knife-edge''' test target. The data, (such as [[pixel|pixel intensity]]), is used to determine the average signal and background values.]]

Traditionally, '''SNR''' has been defined as the ratio of the average signal value &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{sig}&lt;/math&gt; to the [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{bg}&lt;/math&gt; of the background:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{SNR} = \frac{\mu_\mathrm{sig}}{\sigma_\mathrm{bg}}&lt;/math&gt;

However, when presented with a high-contrast scene, many imaging systems [[clamping (graphics)|clamp]] the background to uniform black, forcing &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{bg}&lt;/math&gt; to zero, artificially making the SNR infinite.&lt;ref name=&quot;EO&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
In this case a better definition of SNR is the ratio of the average signal value &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{sig}&lt;/math&gt; to the standard deviation of the ''signal'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{sig}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{SNR} = \frac{\mu_\mathrm{sig}}{\sigma_\mathrm{sig}}&lt;/math&gt;

which gives a meaningful result in the presence of clamping.

==Calculations==

=== Explanation ===
The [[line (video)|line data]] is gathered from the arbitrarily defined signal and background regions and input into an [[Array data structure|array]] (refer to image to the right). To calculate the average signal and background values, a [[polynomial|second order polynomial]] is [[curve fitting|fitted]] to the array of line data and subtracted from the original array line data. This is done to remove any [[trend estimation|trends]]. Finding the mean of this data yields the average signal and background values. The net signal is calculated from the difference of the average signal and background values. The '''RMS''' or [[root mean square]] noise is defined from the signal region. Finally, '''SNR''' is determined as the ratio of the net signal to the '''RMS noise.'''

===Polynomial and coefficients===
*The second order polynomial is calculated by the following double summation.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f_i = \sum_{j=0}^m \sum_{i=1}^n a_j x_i^j&lt;/math&gt;

**&lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; = [[function (mathematics)|output sequence]]
**&lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; = the polynomial order
**&lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; = the [[function (mathematics)|input sequence]] (array/line values) from the signal region or background region, respectively.
**&lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; = the number of [[line (video)|lines]]
**&lt;math&gt;a_j\,&lt;/math&gt; = the polynomial fit [[coefficients]]

*The polynomial fit coefficients can thus be calculated by a [[system of equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Aboufadel, E.F., Goldberg, J.L., Potter, M.C. (2005).''Advanced Engineering Mathematics (3rd ed.).''New York, New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

     \sum x_i      &amp;     \sum x_i^2     &amp;     \sum x_i^3  \\
     \sum x_i^2    &amp;     \sum x_i^3     &amp;     \sum x_i^4  
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
     a_2      \\ 
     a_1      \\
     a_0   
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
     \sum f_i       \\ 
     \sum f_i x_i   \\
     \sum f_i x_i^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

*Computer software or rigorous [[row operations]] will solve for the coefficients.

===Net signal, signal, and background===
The second-order polynomial is subtracted from the original data to remove any trends and then averaged. This yields the signal and background values{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\text{sig} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - f_i)}{n} \qquad \qquad \mu_\text{bkg} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-f_i)}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;\mu_\text{sig}&lt;/math&gt; = average signal value
*&lt;math&gt;\mu_\text{bkg}&lt;/math&gt; = average background value
*&lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; = number of lines in background or signal region
*&lt;math&gt;X_i\,&lt;/math&gt; = value of the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; line in the signal region or background region, respectively.
*&lt;math&gt;f_i\,&lt;/math&gt; = value of the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; output of the second order polynomial.
Hence, the net signal value is determined by {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{signal} = \mu_\text{sig} - \mu_\text{bkg}&lt;/math&gt;.

===RMS noise and SNR===
*The '''RMS Noise''' is defined as the [[square root]] of the [[variance|mean of variances]] from the background region.&lt;ref name=&quot;EO&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{RMS noise} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n})^2}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
The SNR is thus given by
: &lt;math&gt; \text{SNR} = \frac{\text{signal}}{\text{RMS noise}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the industry standard [[20 log rule]]&lt;ref&gt;Test and Measurement World (2008). SNR. In ''Glossary and Abbreviations''.http://www.tmworld.com/info/CA6436814.html?q=SNR&lt;/ref&gt;...
:&lt;math&gt; \text{SNR} = 20 \log_{10} \frac{\text{signal}}{\text{RMS noise}}\,\mbox{dB}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''magnetic moment''' of a [[magnet]] is a quantity that determines the [[torque]] it will experience in an external [[magnetic field]]. A loop of [[electric current]], a bar magnet, an [[electron]] (revolving around a nucleus), a [[molecule]], and a [[planet]] all have magnetic moments.

The magnetic moment may be considered to be a [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] having a magnitude and direction. The direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to north pole of the magnet.  The magnetic field produced by the magnet is proportional to its magnetic moment.  More precisely, the term ''magnetic moment'' normally refers to a system's  '''magnetic dipole moment''', which produces the first term in the [[multipole expansion]] of a general magnetic field. The [[dipole]] component of an object's magnetic field is symmetric about the direction of its magnetic dipole moment, and decreases as the inverse cube of the distance from the object.

== Definition ==
The magnetic moment is defined as a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] relating the aligning [[torque]] on the object from an externally applied [[magnetic field]] to the field vector itself. The relationship is given by&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;
{{cite book |title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials |author=B. D. Cullity, C. D. Graham |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ixAe4qIGEmwC&amp;pg=PA103 |page=103 |isbn=0-471-47741-9 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Wiley-IEEE Press]]|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\tau} = \boldsymbol{\mu} \times\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; is the torque acting on the dipole and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the external magnetic field, and &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic moment.

This definition is based on how one would measure the magnetic moment, in principle, of an unknown sample.

== Units ==
The unit for magnetic moment is not a base unit in the [[International System of Units]] (SI).  As the torque is measured in [[Newton(unit)|newton]]-meters (N·m) and the magnetic field in [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]] (T), the magnetic moment is measured in newton-meters per tesla.  This has equivalents in other base units:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{N}{\cdot}\text{m}/\text{T} = \text{A}{\cdot}\text{m}^2 =  \text{J}/\text{T} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where A is [[ampere]]s and J is [[joule]]s.

In the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] system, there are several different sets of electromagnetism units, of which the main ones are [[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electrostatic units (ESU)|ESU]], [[Gaussian units|Gaussian]], and [[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electromagnetic units (EMU)|EMU]]. Among these, there are two alternative (non-equivalent) units of magnetic dipole moment:
:&lt;math&gt;1~\text{statA}{\cdot}\text{cm}^2 = 3.33564095\cdot10^{-14}~\text{A}{\cdot}\text{m}^2&lt;/math&gt; (ESU)
:&lt;math&gt;1~\text{erg}/\text{G} = 1~\text{abA}{\cdot}\text{cm}^2 = 10^{-3}~\text{A}{\cdot}\text{m}^2&lt;/math&gt; (Gaussian and EMU),

where statA is [[statampere]]s, cm is [[centimeter]]s, erg is [[erg]]s, G is [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]] and abA is [[abampere]]s. The ratio of these two non-equivalent CGS units (EMU/ESU) is equal to the [[speed of light|speed of light in free space]], expressed in [[Centimetre|cm]]·[[Second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

All formulae in this article are correct in [[SI]] units; they may need to be changed for use in other unit systems. For example, in SI units, a loop of current with current ''I'' and area ''A'' has magnetic moment ''IA'' (see below), but in [[Gaussian units]] the magnetic moment is ''IA''/[[speed of light|''c'']].

== Two representations of the cause of the magnetic moment ==
The preferred classical explanation of a magnetic moment has changed over time.  Before the 1930s, textbooks explained the moment using hypothetical magnetic point charges. Since then, most have defined it in terms of Ampèrian currents.&lt;ref name=Brown62&gt;{{harvnb|Brown, Jr.|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In magnetic materials, the cause of the magnetic moment are the [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic moment and angular momentum|spin and orbital angular momentum states]] of the electrons, and whether atoms in one region are aligned with atoms in another.

=== Magnetic pole representation ===
[[File:VFPt dipole electric.svg|thumb|upright|An electrostatic analog for a magnetic moment: two opposing charges separated by a finite distance.]]
The sources of magnetic moments in materials can be represented by poles in analogy to [[electrostatics]]. Consider a bar magnet which has magnetic poles of equal magnitude but opposite [[Polarity (physics)|polarity]]. Each pole is the source of magnetic force which weakens with distance. Since [[magnet#Two models for magnets: magnetic poles and atomic currents|magnetic poles]] always come in pairs, their forces partially cancel each other because while one pole pulls, the other repels.  This cancellation is greatest when the poles are close to each other i.e. when the bar magnet is short. The magnetic force produced by a bar magnet, at a given point in space, therefore depends on two factors:  the strength ''p'' of its poles ('''magnetic pole strength'''), and the vector '''ℓ''' separating them. The moment is related to the fictitious poles as&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown62&quot; /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mu}=p\boldsymbol{\ell}.&lt;/math&gt;

It points in the direction from South to North pole. The analogy with electric dipoles should not be taken too far because magnetic dipoles are associated with [[angular momentum]] (see [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic moment and angular momentum|Magnetic moment and angular momentum]]). Nevertheless, magnetic poles are very useful for [[Magnetostatics|magnetostatic]] calculations, particularly in applications to [[ferromagnets]].&lt;ref name=Brown62/&gt; Practitioners using the magnetic pole approach generally represent the [[magnetic field]] by the [[irrotational]] field '''H''', in analogy to the [[electric field]] '''E'''.

=== Integral representation ===
[[File:Magnetic moment.svg|thumb|left|200px|Moment '''μ''' of a planar current having magnitude '''I''' and enclosing an area '''S''']]
We start from the definition of the differential magnetic moment [[pseudovector]] :

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;

where × is the [[vector cross product]], '''r''' is the position vector, and j is the [[electric current density]].
It is very similar to the differential [[angular momentum]], defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{l}=\mathbf{r}\times (\rho \mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is the [[mass density]] and ''v'' is the [[velocity]] vector.
Like in every pseudovector, by convention the direction of the cross product is given by the [[right hand grip rule]].

Practitioners using the current loop model generally represent the magnetic field by the [[solenoidal]] field '''B''', analogous to the electrostatic field '''D'''.

The integral magnetic moment of a charge distribution is therefore:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Mu}=\frac{1}{2}\iiint_V \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{j}\,{\rm d}V,&lt;/math&gt;

Let us start with a point particle; in this simple situation the magnetic moment is:

: &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\Mu} =\frac{1}{2} q\, \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;,

where '''r''' is the position of the [[electric charge]] ''q'' relative to the center of the circle and '''v''' is the instantaneous velocity of the charge, giving an [[electric current density]] ''j''. 

On the other hand for a point particle the [[angular momentum]] is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;,

and in the planar case:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Mu}=\frac{1}{2}\iint_S \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{j}\,{\rm d}S,&lt;/math&gt;

by defining the [[electric current]] with a [[vector area]] '''S''' (''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' coordinates of this vector are the areas of projections of the loop onto the ''yz'', ''zx'', and ''xy'' planes):

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Mu}=\frac{I}{2}\int_{\partial S} \mathbf{r}\times{\rm d}\mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then by [[Stokes' theorem]], integral magnetic moment then becomes expressible as:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Mu}=I \mathbf{S}.&lt;/math&gt;

The factor 1/2 in our definition above is only due to historical reason: the old definition of the magnetic moment was this last integral equation. If one had started from a differential definition:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu} = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;

then the coherent integral expression would have been:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Mu}=2 I \mathbf{S}.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Magnetic moment of a solenoid ====
[[File:Solenoid, air core, insulated, 20 turns, (shaded).svg|thumb|right|Image of a solenoid]]
A generalization of the above current loop is a coil, or [[solenoid]]. Its moment is the vector sum of the moments of individual turns. If the solenoid has ''N'' identical turns (single-layer winding) and vector area '''S''',
: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu}=N I \mathbf{S}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Magnetic moment and angular momentum ==
The magnetic moment has a close connection with [[angular momentum]] called the '''gyromagnetic effect'''. This effect is expressed on a [[macroscopic scale]] in the [[Einstein-de Haas effect]], or &quot;rotation by magnetization,&quot; and its inverse, the [[Barnett effect]], or &quot;magnetization by rotation.&quot;&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; In particular, when a magnetic moment is subject to a [[torque]] in a magnetic field that tends to align it with the applied magnetic field, the moment [[precession|precesses]] (rotates about the axis of the applied field). This is a consequence of the concomitance of magnetic moment and angular momentum, that in case of charged massive particles corresponds to the concomitance of charge and mass in a particle.

Viewing a magnetic dipole as a rotating charged particle brings out the close connection between magnetic moment and angular momentum. Both the magnetic moment and the angular momentum increase with the rate of rotation. The ratio of the two is called the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] and is simply the half of the [[charge-to-mass ratio]].&lt;ref name=Krey&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Theoretical Physics |author= Uwe Krey, Anthony Owen |pages=151–152 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=xZ_QelBmkxYC&amp;pg=PA151 |isbn=3-540-36804-3 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Buxton&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard B. Buxton |title=Introduction to functional magnetic resonance imaging  |page=136 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=6XVu0NKzgekC&amp;pg=PA136 |isbn=0-521-58113-3 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a spinning charged solid with a uniform charge density to mass density ratio, the gyromagnetic ratio is equal to half the [[charge-to-mass ratio]]. This implies that a more massive assembly of charges spinning with the same [[angular momentum]] will have a [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionately]] weaker magnetic moment, compared to its lighter counterpart. Even though atomic particles cannot be accurately described as spinning charge distributions of uniform charge-to-mass ratio, this general trend can be observed in the atomic world, where the intrinsic angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) of each type of particle is a constant: a small [[half-integer]] times the reduced [[Planck constant]] ''ħ''. This is the basis for defining the magnetic moment units of [[Bohr magneton]] (assuming [[charge-to-mass ratio]] of the [[electron]]) and [[nuclear magneton]] (assuming [[charge-to-mass ratio]] of the [[proton]]).

== Effects of an external magnetic field on a magnetic moment ==

=== Force on a moment ===
{{see also|force between magnets}}
A magnetic moment in an externally produced magnetic field has a potential energy ''U'':

: &lt;math&gt;U=-\boldsymbol{\mu}\cdot\mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;

In a case when the external magnetic field is non-uniform, there will be a
force, proportional to the magnetic field [[gradient]], acting on the magnetic moment itself. There has been some discussion on how to calculate the force acting on a magnetic dipole. There are two expressions for the force acting on a magnetic dipole, depending on whether the [[Magnet#Two models for magnets: magnetic poles and atomic currents|model used for the dipole]] is a current loop or two monopoles (analogous to the electric dipole).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The force obtained in the case of a current loop model is

:&lt;math Floop&gt;\mathbf{F}_\text{loop}=\nabla \left(\boldsymbol{\mu}\cdot\mathbf{B}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a pair of monopoles being used (i.e. electric dipole model)

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\text{dipole}=\left(\boldsymbol{\mu}\cdot \nabla \right) \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

and one can be put in terms of the other via the relation

:&lt;math Feq&gt;\mathbf{F}_\text{loop}=\mathbf{F}_\text{dipole} + \boldsymbol{\mu}\times \left(\nabla \times \mathbf{B} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

In all these expressions '''''μ''''' is the dipole and '''B''' is the magnetic field at its position. Note that if there are no currents or time-varying electrical fields {{math|∇ × '''B''' {{=}} 0}} and the two expressions agree.

An electron, nucleus, or atom placed in a uniform magnetic field will precess with a frequency known as the [[Larmor frequency]].  See [[Resonance]].

== Magnetic dipoles ==
{{Main|Magnetic dipole}}
{{See also|Dipole}}
A magnetic dipole is the limit of either a current loop or a pair of poles as the dimensions of the source are reduced to zero while keeping the moment constant. As long as these limits only apply to fields far from the sources, they are equivalent. However, the two models give different predictions for the internal field (see below).

=== External magnetic field produced by a magnetic dipole moment===
[[File:Magnetic dipole moment.jpg|thumbnail|right|Magnetic field lines around a &quot;magnetostatic dipole&quot;.  The magnetic dipole itself is located in the center of the figure, seen from the side, and pointing upward.]]
Any system possessing a net magnetic dipole moment '''m''' will produce a [[dipole|dipolar]] magnetic field (described below) in the space surrounding the system. While the net magnetic field produced by the system can also have higher-order [[multipole]] components, those will drop off with distance more rapidly, so that only the dipolar component will dominate the magnetic field of the system at distances far away from it.

The [[Magnetic potential#Magnetic vector potential|vector potential]] of magnetic field produced by magnetic moment '''m''' is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(\mathbf r)=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{\mathbf m\times\mathbf r}{|\mathbf r|^3}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{\mathbf m\times \hat\mathbf r}{|\mathbf r|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and [[magnetic flux density]] is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}({\mathbf{r}})=\nabla\times{\mathbf{A}}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\left(\frac{3\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{r})}{|\mathbf r|^5}-\frac{{\mathbf{m}}}{|\mathbf r|^3}\right)=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi|\bold r|^3}\left(3\left(\bold m \cdot \hat\bold r\right)\hat\bold r - \bold m\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively one can obtain the [[Magnetic potential#Magnetic scalar potential|scalar potential]] first from the magnetic pole perspective,
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf r)=\frac{\mathbf m\cdot\mathbf r}{4\pi|\mathbf r|^3}=\frac{\mathbf m\cdot\hat\mathbf r}{4\pi|\mathbf r|^2},&lt;/math&gt;

and hence [[magnetic field strength]] is
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{H}}({\mathbf{r}})=-\nabla\psi=\frac{1}{4\pi}\left(\frac{3\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{r})}{|\mathbf r|^5}-\frac{{\mathbf{m}}}{|\mathbf r|^3}\right)=\frac{1}{4\pi|\bold r|^3}\left(3\left(\bold m \cdot \hat\bold r\right)\hat\bold r - \bold m\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The magnetic field of an ideal magnetic dipole is depicted on the right.

=== Internal magnetic field of a dipole ===
[[File:VFPt dipole magnetic3.svg|thumbnail|right|The magnetic field of a current loop]]
The two models for a dipole (current loop and magnetic poles) give the same predictions for the magnetic field far from the source. However, inside the source region they give different predictions. The magnetic field between poles (see figure for [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic pole representation|Magnetic pole definition]]) is in the opposite direction to the magnetic moment (which points from the negative charge to the positive charge), while inside a current loop it is in the same direction (see the figure to the right). Clearly, the limits of these fields must also be different as the sources shrink to zero size. This distinction only matters if the dipole limit is used to calculate fields inside a magnetic material.&lt;ref name=Brown62/&gt;

If a magnetic dipole is formed by making a current loop smaller and smaller, but keeping the product of current and area constant, the limiting field is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\left[\frac{3\mathbf{n}(\mathbf{n}\cdot \mathbf{m})-\mathbf{m}}{|\mathbf{x}|^3} + \frac{8\pi}{3}\mathbf{m}\delta(\mathbf{x})\right].&lt;/math&gt;
Unlike the expressions in the previous section, this limit is correct for the internal field of the dipole.&lt;ref name=Brown62/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1975|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a magnetic dipole is formed by taking a &quot;north pole&quot; and a &quot;south pole&quot;, bringing them closer and closer together but keeping the product of magnetic pole-charge and distance constant, the limiting field is&lt;ref name=Brown62/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x}) =\frac{1}{4\pi}\left[\frac{3\mathbf{n}(\mathbf{n}\cdot \mathbf{m})-\mathbf{m}}{|\mathbf{x}|^3} - \frac{4\pi}{3}\mathbf{m}\delta(\mathbf{x})\right].&lt;/math&gt;

These fields are related by &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B}= \mu_0\left(\mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{m}\delta(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[magnetization]].

=== Forces between two magnetic dipoles ===

As discussed earlier, the force exerted by a dipole loop with moment {{math|'''m'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} on another with moment {{math|'''m'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\bold F =\nabla \left(\bold m_2\cdot\bold B_1\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''B'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the magnetic field due to moment {{math|'''m'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The result of calculating the gradient is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Examples of magnetic moments ==

=== Two kinds of magnetic sources ===
Fundamentally, contributions to any system's magnetic moment may come from sources of two kinds: (1) motion of [[electric charge]]s, such as [[electric current]]s, and (2) the [[Spin (physics)#Magnetic moments|intrinsic magnetism]] of [[elementary particle]]s, such as the [[electron]].

Contributions due to the sources of the first kind can be calculated from knowing the distribution of all the electric currents (or, alternatively, of all the electric charges and their velocities) inside the system, by using the formulas below. On the other hand, the [[Euclidean vector|magnitude]] of each elementary particle's intrinsic magnetic moment is a fixed number, often measured experimentally to a great precision. For example, any electron's magnetic moment is measured to be {{val|-9.284764|e=-24|u=J/T}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?muem |title=CODATA value: electron magnetic moment}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Euclidean vector|direction]] of the magnetic moment of any elementary particle is entirely determined by the direction of its [[spin (physics)|spin]], with the [[minus sign|negative value]] indicating that any electron's magnetic moment is antiparallel to its spin.

The net magnetic moment of any system is a [[Euclidean vector|vector sum]] of contributions from one or both types of sources.
For example, the magnetic moment of an atom of [[Hydrogen atom|hydrogen-1]] (the lightest hydrogen isotope, consisting of a proton and an electron) is a vector sum of the following contributions:

# the intrinsic moment of the electron,
# the orbital motion of the electron around the proton,
# the intrinsic moment of the proton.

Similarly, the magnetic moment of a [[bar magnet]] is the sum of the contributing magnetic moments, which include the intrinsic and orbital magnetic moments of the unpaired [[electron]]s of the magnet's material and the nuclear magnetic moments.

=== Magnetic moment of an atom ===
For an atom, individual electron spins are added to get a total spin, and individual orbital angular momenta are added to get a total orbital [[angular momentum]]. These two then are added using [[angular momentum coupling]] to get a total angular momentum. The magnitude of the atomic dipole moment is then&lt;ref name=Tilley2&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Solids |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZVgOLCXNoMoC&amp;pg=PA368 |page=368 |isbn=0-470-85275-5 |author=RJD Tilley |year=2004 |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;m_\text{Atom} = g_J \mu_B \sqrt{j(j+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''j'' is the [[total angular momentum quantum number]], ''g&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Landé g-factor]], and ''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Bohr magneton]]. The component of this magnetic moment along the direction of the magnetic field is then&lt;ref name=Llewellyn&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Physics |author=Paul Allen Tipler, Ralph A. Llewellyn |url=http://books.google.com/?id=tpU18JqcSNkC&amp;pg=PA310 |page=310  |isbn=0-7167-4345-0 |year=2002 |edition=4 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;m_\text{Atom}(z) = -m g_J \mu_B&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is called the [[magnetic quantum number]] or the ''equatorial'' quantum number, which can take on any of 2''j''+1 values:&lt;ref name=Crowther&gt;{{cite book |title=Ions, Electrons and Ionizing Radiations |author=JA Crowther |page=277 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=H_sft9-zm5AC&amp;pg=PA277 |isbn=1-4067-2039-9 |year=2007 |publisher=Rene Press |edition= reprinted Cambridge (1934) 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-j, -(j-1) \cdots 0 \cdots +(j-1), +j&lt;/math&gt;.

The negative sign occurs because electrons have negative charge.

Due to the angular momentum, the dynamics of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field differs from that of an electric dipole in an electric field. The field does exert a torque on the magnetic dipole tending to align it with the field. However, torque is proportional to rate of change of angular momentum,  so [[precession]] occurs: the direction of spin changes. This behavior is described by the [[Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation]]:&lt;ref name=Rice&gt;{{cite book |title=Advances in chemical physics |author=Stuart Alan Rice |url=http://books.google.com/?id=wK3Vhq-VnBQC&amp;pg=PA208 |pages=208 ''ff'' |isbn=0-471-44528-2 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steiner&gt;{{cite book |title=Micromagnetism and Electrical Resistance of Ferromagnetic Electrodes for Spin Injection Devices |author=Marcus Steiner |publisher=Cuvillier Verlag |year=2004 |isbn=3-86537-176-0 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=tnX1edkCB-wC&amp;pg=PA6 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\gamma} \frac{{\rm d}\mathbf{m}}{{\rm d}t} = \mathbf{m \times H_\text{eff}} - \frac{\lambda}{\gamma m}\mathbf{m} \times \frac{{\rm d}\mathbf{m}}{{\rm d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is gyromagnetic ratio, '''m''' is magnetic moment, ''λ'' is damping coefficient and '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; is effective magnetic field (the external field plus any self-field). The first term describes precession of the moment about the effective field, while the second is a damping term related to dissipation of energy caused by interaction with the surroundings.

=== Magnetic moment of an electron ===
{{see also|Anomalous magnetic dipole moment}}
[[Electron]]s and many elementary particles also have intrinsic [[Electron magnetic moment|magnetic moments]], an explanation of which requires a quantum mechanical treatment and relates to the intrinsic [[angular momentum]] of the particles as discussed in the article [[Electron magnetic moment]]. It is these intrinsic magnetic moments that give rise to the macroscopic effects of [[magnetism]], and other phenomena, such as [[electron paramagnetic resonance]].

The magnetic moment of the electron is
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{m}_\text{S} = -\frac{g_\text{S} \mu_\text{B} \mathbf{S}}{\hbar},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Bohr magneton]], '''S''' is electron [[spin (physics)|spin]], and the [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] ''g''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is 2 according to [[Dirac equation|Dirac]]'s theory, but due to [[quantum electrodynamics|quantum electrodynamic]] effects it is slightly larger in reality: 2.002 319 304 36. The deviation from 2 is known as the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment]].

Again it is important to notice that '''m''' is a negative constant multiplied by the [[spin (physics)|spin]], so the magnetic moment of the electron is antiparallel to the spin.  This can be understood with the following classical picture: if we imagine that the spin angular momentum is created by the electron mass spinning around some axis, the electric current that this rotation creates circulates in the ''opposite'' direction, because of the negative charge of the electron; such current loops produce a magnetic moment which is antiparallel to the spin.  Hence, for a positron (the anti-particle of the electron) the magnetic moment is parallel to its spin.

=== Magnetic moment of a nucleus ===
{{See also|Nuclear magnetic moment}}
The nuclear system is a complex physical system consisting of nucleons, i.e., [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s. The quantum mechanical properties of the nucleons include the spin among others. Since the electromagnetic moments of the nucleus depend on the spin of the individual nucleons, one can look at these properties with measurements of nuclear moments, and more specifically the nuclear magnetic dipole moment.

Most common nuclei exist in their [[ground state]], although nuclei of some [[isotope]]s have long-lived [[excited state]]s. Each [[energy state]] of a nucleus of a given isotope is characterized by a well-defined magnetic dipole moment, the magnitude of which is a fixed number, often measured experimentally to a great precision. This number is very sensitive to the individual contributions from nucleons, and a measurement or prediction of its value can reveal important information about the content of the nuclear wave function. There are several theoretical models that predict the value of the magnetic dipole moment and a number of experimental techniques aiming to carry out measurements in nuclei along the nuclear chart.

=== Magnetic moment of a molecule ===
Any molecule has a well-defined magnitude of magnetic moment, which may depend on the molecule's [[energy state]]. Typically, the overall magnetic moment of a molecule is a combination of the following contributions, in the order of their typical strength:
* magnetic moments due to its unpaired [[electron spin]]s ([[paramagnetic]] contribution), if any
* orbital motion of its electrons, which in the [[Stationary state#Ground state|ground state]] is often proportional to the external magnetic field ([[diamagnetic]] contribution)
* the combined magnetic moment of its [[nuclear spin]]s, which depends on the [[Angular momentum coupling#Spin-spin coupling|nuclear spin configuration]].

==== Examples of molecular magnetism ====
* [[Oxygen]] molecule, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, exhibits strong [[paramagnetism]], due to unpaired spins of its outermost two electrons.
* [[Carbon dioxide]] molecule, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, mostly exhibits [[diamagnetism]], a much weaker magnetic moment of the electron [[Molecular orbital|orbitals]] that is proportional to the external magnetic field. The nuclear magnetism of a magnetic [[isotope]] such as &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C or &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O will contribute to the molecule's magnetic moment.
* [[Hydrogen]] molecule, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in a weak (or zero) magnetic field exhibits nuclear magnetism, and can be in a [[parahydrogen|para-]] or an [[orthohydrogen|ortho-]] nuclear spin configuration.
* Many transition metal complexes are magnetic. The spin-only formula is a good first approximation for high-spin complexes of first-row [[transition metal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Figgis&amp;Lewis, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electrical impedance''' is the measure of the opposition that a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] presents to a [[electrical current|current]] when a [[voltage]] is applied.

In quantitative terms, it is the [[complex number|complex]] [[ratio]] of the voltage to the current in an [[alternating current]] (AC) circuit. Impedance extends the concept of [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] to AC circuits, and possesses both magnitude and [[Phase (waves)|phase]], unlike resistance, which has only magnitude. When a circuit is driven with [[direct current]] (DC), there is no distinction between impedance and resistance; the latter can be thought of as impedance with zero [[phase angle]].

It is necessary to introduce the concept of impedance in AC circuits because there are two additional impeding mechanisms to be taken into account besides the normal resistance of DC circuits: the induction of voltages in conductors self-induced by the [[magnetic field]]s of currents ([[inductance]]), and the electrostatic storage of charge induced by voltages between conductors ([[capacitance]]). The impedance caused by these two effects is collectively referred to as [[electrical reactance|reactance]] and forms the [[imaginary number|imaginary]] part of complex impedance whereas resistance forms the [[real number|real]] part.

The symbol for impedance is usually {{math|''Z''}} and it may be represented by writing its magnitude and phase in the form {{math|{{!}}''Z''{{!}}''∠θ''}}. However, cartesian complex number representation is often more powerful for circuit analysis purposes.

The term ''impedance'' was coined by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in July 1886.&lt;ref&gt;''Science'', p.&amp;nbsp;18, 1888&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Heaviside, ''The Electrician'', p.&amp;nbsp;212, 23 July 1886, reprinted as ''Electrical Papers'', p 64, AMS Bookstore, ISBN 0-8218-3465-7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Kennelly]] was the first to represent impedance with complex numbers in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4768008 Kennelly, Arthur. ''Impedance'' (AIEE, 1893)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Impedance is defined as the [[frequency domain]] ratio of the voltage to the current.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Alexander | first = Charles | last2 = Sadiku | first2 = Matthew | title = Fundamentals of Electric Circuits | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2006 | edition = 3, revised | pages =387–389 | isbn = 978-0-07-330115-0 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is the voltage–current ratio for a single [[complex exponential]] at a particular frequency {{math|''ω''}}. In general, impedance will be a complex number, with the same [[dimensional analysis|units]] as resistance, for which the [[SI unit]] is the [[ohm]] ({{math|Ω}}). For a sinusoidal current or voltage input, the [[Complex number#Notation of the polar form|polar form]] of the complex impedance relates the amplitude and phase of the voltage and current. In particular:
* The magnitude of the complex impedance is the ratio of the voltage amplitude to the current amplitude.
* The phase of the complex impedance is the [[phase shift]] by which the current lags the voltage.
The [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of impedance is [[admittance]] (i.e., admittance is the current-to-voltage ratio, and it conventionally carries units of [[siemens (unit)|siemens]], formerly called [[mho]]s).

==Complex impedance==

[[File:Complex Impedance.svg|200px|thumb|right|A graphical representation of the [[Complex plane|complex impedance plane]]]]

Impedance is represented as a [[Complex number|complex]] quantity &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt; and the term ''complex impedance'' may be used interchangeably.

The [[Polar coordinates|polar form]] conveniently captures both magnitude and phase characteristics as

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z = |Z| e^{j\arg (Z)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the magnitude &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |Z|&lt;/math&gt; represents the ratio of the voltage difference amplitude to the current amplitude, while the argument &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \arg (Z)&lt;/math&gt; (commonly given the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta &lt;/math&gt;) gives the phase difference between voltage and current. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]], and is used instead of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle i&lt;/math&gt; in this context to avoid confusion with the symbol for [[Ampere|electric current]].

In [[Cartesian plane|Cartesian form]], impedance is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z = R + jX&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[real part]] of impedance is the resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; and the [[imaginary part]] is the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt;.

Where it is needed to add or subtract impedances, the cartesian form is more convenient; but when quantities are multiplied or divided, the calculation becomes simpler if the polar form is used. A circuit calculation, such as finding the total impedance of two impedances in parallel, may require conversion between forms several times during the calculation. Conversion between the forms follows the normal [[Complex number#Polar form|conversion rules of complex numbers]].

== Ohm's law ==
[[File:General AC circuit.svg|thumb|right|165px|An AC supply applying a voltage &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V&lt;/math&gt;, across a [[Electrical load|load]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt;, driving a current &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle I&lt;/math&gt;.]]
{{Main|Ohm's law}}

The meaning of electrical impedance can be understood by substituting it into [[Ohm's law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/imped.html AC Ohm's law], Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HH1&gt;{{cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Paul|author2=Hill, Winfield |title=The Art of Electronics |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0-521-37095-7 |pages=32–33 |chapter=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ V = I Z = I |Z| e^{j \arg (Z)}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude of the impedance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |Z|&lt;/math&gt; acts just like resistance, giving the drop in voltage amplitude across an impedance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt; for a given current &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle I&lt;/math&gt;. The [[phase factor]] tells us that the current lags the voltage by a phase of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta \;=\; \arg (Z)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., in the [[time domain]], the current signal is shifted &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{\theta}{2 \pi} T&lt;/math&gt; later with respect to the voltage signal).

Just as impedance extends Ohm's law to cover AC circuits, other results from DC circuit analysis, such as [[Voltage divider|voltage division]], [[Current divider|current division]], [[Thévenin's theorem]] and [[Norton's theorem]], can also be extended to AC circuits by replacing resistance with impedance.

== Complex voltage and current ==
[[File:Impedance symbol comparison.svg|thumb|right|165px|Generalized impedances in a circuit can be drawn with the same symbol as a resistor (US ANSI or DIN Euro) or with a labeled box.]]
In order to simplify calculations, [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al voltage and current waves are commonly represented as complex-valued functions of time denoted as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle I&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/impcom.html#c1 Complex impedance], Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HH2&gt;{{cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Paul|author2=Hill, Winfield |title=The Art of Electronics |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0-521-37095-7 |pages=31–32 |chapter=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  V &amp;= |V|e^{j(\omega t + \phi_V)} \\
  I &amp;= |I|e^{j(\omega t + \phi_I)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Impedance is defined as the ratio of these quantities.

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these into Ohm's law, we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  |V| e^{j(\omega t + \phi_V)} &amp;= |I| e^{j(\omega t + \phi_I)} |Z| e^{j\theta} \\
                               &amp;= |I| |Z| e^{j(\omega t + \phi_I + \theta)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that this must hold for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, we may equate the magnitudes and phases to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     |V| &amp;= |I| |Z| \\
  \phi_V &amp;= \phi_I + \theta
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude equation is the familiar Ohm's law applied to the voltage and current amplitudes, while the second equation defines the phase relationship.

=== Validity of complex representation ===
This representation using complex exponentials may be justified by noting that (by [[Euler's formula]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\ \cos(\omega t + \phi) = \frac{1}{2} \Big[ e^{j(\omega t + \phi)} + e^{-j(\omega t + \phi)}\Big]&lt;/math&gt;

The real-valued sinusoidal function representing either voltage or current may be broken into two complex-valued functions. By the principle of [[superposition principle|superposition]], we may analyse the behaviour of the sinusoid on the left-hand side by analysing the behaviour of the two complex terms on the right-hand side. Given the symmetry, we only need to perform the analysis for one right-hand term; the results will be identical for the other. At the end of any calculation, we may return to real-valued sinusoids by further noting that

:&lt;math&gt;\ \cos(\omega t + \phi) = \Re \Big\{ e^{j(\omega t + \phi)} \Big\}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Phasors ===
{{Main|Phasor (electronics)}}

A phasor is a constant complex number, usually expressed in exponential form, representing the complex amplitude (magnitude and phase) of a sinusoidal function of time. Phasors are used by electrical engineers to simplify computations involving sinusoids, where they can often reduce a differential equation problem to an algebraic one.

The impedance of a circuit element can be defined as the ratio of the phasor voltage across the element to the phasor current through the element, as determined by the relative amplitudes and phases of the voltage and current. This is identical to the definition from [[Electrical impedance#Ohm's law|Ohm's law]] given above, recognising that the factors of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle e^{j\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; cancel.

== Device examples ==

[[File:VI phase.png|thumb|right|250px|The phase angles in the equations for the impedance of capacitors and inductors indicate that the voltage across a capacitor ''lags'' the current through it by a phase of &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;, while the voltage across an inductor ''leads'' the current through it by &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;. The identical voltage and current amplitudes indicate that the magnitude of the impedance is equal to one.]]

The impedance of an ideal [[resistor]] is purely real and is referred to as a ''resistive impedance'':

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_R = R&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the voltage and current waveforms are proportional and in phase.

Ideal [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s have a purely [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] ''reactive impedance'':

the impedance of inductors increases as frequency increases;

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_L = j\omega L&lt;/math&gt;

the impedance of capacitors decreases as frequency increases;

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_C = \frac{1}{j\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

In both cases, for an applied sinusoidal voltage, the resulting current is also sinusoidal, but in [[quadrature phase|quadrature]], 90 degrees out of phase with the voltage. However, the phases have opposite signs: in an inductor, the current is ''lagging''; in a capacitor the current is ''leading''.

Note the following identities for the imaginary unit and its reciprocal:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                      j &amp;\equiv \cos{\left( \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} + j\sin{\left( \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} \equiv e^{j \frac{\pi}{2}} \\
  \frac{1}{j} \equiv -j &amp;\equiv \cos{\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} + j\sin{\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} \equiv e^{j(-\frac{\pi}{2})}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the inductor and capacitor impedance equations can be rewritten in polar form:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Z_L &amp;= \omega Le^{j\frac{\pi}{2}} \\
  Z_C &amp;= \frac{1}{\omega C}e^{j\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude gives the change in voltage amplitude for a given current amplitude through the impedance, while the exponential factors give the phase relationship.

=== Deriving the device-specific impedances ===
What follows below is a derivation of impedance for each of the three basic [[Electrical network|circuit]] elements: the resistor, the capacitor, and the inductor. Although the idea can be extended to define the relationship between the voltage and current of any arbitrary [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]], these derivations will assume [[sinusoidal]] signals, since any arbitrary signal can be approximated as a sum of sinusoids through [[Fourier analysis]].

====Resistor====
For a resistor, there is the relation
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{R}} \left( t \right) = {i_{\text{R}} \left( t \right)}R&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Ohm's law]].

Considering the voltage signal to be
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{R}}(t) = V_p \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_{\text{R}} \left( t \right)}{i_{\text{R}} \left( t \right)} = \frac{V_p \sin(\omega t)}{I_p \sin \left( \omega t \right)} = R&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the ratio of AC voltage amplitude to [[alternating current]] (AC) amplitude across a resistor is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt;, and that the AC voltage leads the current across a resistor by 0 degrees.

This result is commonly expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{resistor}} = R&lt;/math&gt;

====Capacitor====
For a capacitor, there is the relation:
:&lt;math&gt;i_{\text{C}}(t) = C \frac{\operatorname{d}v_{\text{C}}(t)}{\operatorname{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

Considering the voltage signal to be
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{C}}(t) = V_p \sin(\omega t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}v_{\text{C}}(t)}{\operatorname{d}t} = \omega V_p \cos \left( \omega t \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and thus
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_{\text{C}} \left( t \right)}{i_{\text{C}} \left( t \right)} = \frac{V_p \sin(\omega t)}{\omega V_p C \cos \left( \omega t \right)}= \frac{\sin(\omega t)}{\omega C \sin \left( \omega t + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the ratio of AC voltage amplitude to AC current amplitude across a capacitor is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;, and that the AC voltage lags the AC current across a capacitor by 90 degrees (or the AC current leads the AC voltage across a capacitor by 90 degrees).

This result is commonly expressed in [[polar form]] as
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{capacitor}} = \frac{1}{\omega C} e^{-j \frac{\pi}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

or, by applying Euler's formula, as
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{capacitor}} = -j\frac{1}{\omega C} = \frac{1}{j \omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

====Inductor====
For the inductor, we have the relation:
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{L}}(t) = L \frac{\operatorname{d}i_{\text{L}}(t)}{\operatorname{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

This time, considering the current signal to be:
:&lt;math&gt;i_{\text{L}}(t) = I_p \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}i_{\text{L}}(t)}{\operatorname{d}t} = \omega I_p \cos \left( \omega t \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and thus:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_{\text{L}} \left( t \right)}{i_{\text{L}} \left( t \right)} = \frac{\omega I_p L \cos(\omega t)}{I_p \sin \left( \omega t \right)} = \frac{\omega L \sin \left( \omega t + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{\sin(\omega t)}&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the ratio of AC voltage amplitude to AC current amplitude across an inductor is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega L&lt;/math&gt;, and that the AC voltage leads the AC current across an inductor by 90 degrees.

This result is commonly expressed in polar form as
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{inductor}} = \omega L e^{j \frac{\pi}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

or, using Euler's formula, as
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{inductor}} = j \omega L&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalised s-plane impedance==
Impedance defined in terms of ''jω'' can strictly be applied only to circuits that are driven with a steady-state AC signal. The concept of impedance can be extended to a circuit energised with any arbitrary signal by using [[complex frequency]] instead of ''jω''. Complex frequency is given the symbol ''s'' and is, in general, a complex number. Signals are expressed in terms of complex frequency by taking the [[Laplace transform]] of the [[time domain]] expression of the signal. The impedance of the basic circuit elements in this more general notation is as follows:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:3em;&quot;
|-
!Element||Impedance expression
|-
|Resistor||&lt;math&gt;R \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Inductor||&lt;math&gt;sL \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Capacitor||&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{sC} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For a DC circuit, this simplifies to {{nowrap|1=''s'' = 0}}. For a steady-state sinusoidal AC signal {{nowrap|1=''s'' = ''jω''}}.

== Resistance vs reactance ==

Resistance and reactance together determine the magnitude and phase of the impedance through the following relations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     |Z| &amp;= \sqrt{Z Z^*} = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2} \\
  \theta &amp;= \arctan{\left(\frac{X}{R}\right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In many applications, the relative phase of the voltage and current is not critical so only the magnitude of the impedance is significant.

=== Resistance ===
&lt;!--[[File:Resistors.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A pack of resistors. [[Media:Resistors.jpg|Actual size]]]]--&gt;
{{Main|Electrical resistance}}

Resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; is the real part of impedance; a device with a purely resistive impedance exhibits no phase shift between the voltage and current.

:&lt;math&gt;\ R = |Z| \cos{\theta} \quad&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reactance ===
{{Main|Electrical reactance}}

Reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; is the imaginary part of the impedance; a component with a finite reactance induces a phase shift &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta&lt;/math&gt; between the voltage across it and the current through it.

:&lt;math&gt;\ X = |Z| \sin{\theta} \quad&lt;/math&gt;

A purely reactive component is distinguished by the sinusoidal voltage across the component being in quadrature with the sinusoidal current through the component. This implies that the component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit. A pure reactance will not dissipate any power.

==== Capacitive reactance ====
&lt;!--[[File:Photo-SMDcapacitors.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Capacitors: [[Surface-mount technology|SMD]] ceramic at top left; SMD tantalum at bottom left; [[through-hole]] tantalum at top right; through-hole electrolytic at bottom right. Major scale divisions are cm. [[Media:Resistors.jpg|Actual size]]]]--&gt;
{{Main|Capacitance}}

A capacitor has a purely reactive impedance which is [[Inversely proportional#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the signal [[frequency]]. A capacitor consists of two [[Electrical conduction|conductor]]s separated by an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], also known as a [[dielectric]].

:&lt;math&gt;X_C = (\omega C)^{-1} = (2\pi f C)^{-1}\quad&lt;/math&gt;

At low frequencies, a capacitor is an open circuit so no charge flows in the dielectric.

A DC voltage applied across a capacitor causes [[Electrical charge|charge]] to accumulate on one side; the [[electric field]] due to the accumulated charge is the source of the opposition to the current. When the [[potential]] associated with the charge exactly balances the applied voltage, the current goes to zero.

Driven by an AC supply, a capacitor will only accumulate a limited amount of charge before the potential difference changes sign and the charge dissipates. The higher the frequency, the less charge will accumulate and the smaller the opposition to the current.

==== Inductive reactance ====
{{Main|Inductance}}

Inductive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_L}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the signal [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{f}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[inductance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;X_L = \omega L = 2\pi f L\quad&lt;/math&gt;

An inductor consists of a coiled conductor. [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] of electromagnetic induction gives the back [[Electromotive force|emf]]&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathcal{E}}&lt;/math&gt; (voltage opposing current) due to a rate-of-change of [[magnetic flux density]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{B}&lt;/math&gt; through a current loop.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -{{d\Phi_B} \over dt}\quad&lt;/math&gt;

For an inductor consisting of a coil with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; loops this gives.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -N{d\Phi_B \over dt}\quad&lt;/math&gt;

The back-emf is the source of the opposition to current flow. A constant [[direct current]] has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a [[short-circuit]] (it is typically made from a material with a low [[resistivity]]). An [[alternating current]] has a time-averaged rate-of-change that is proportional to frequency, this causes the increase in inductive reactance with frequency.

==== Total reactance ====

The total reactance is given by

:&lt;math&gt;{X = X_L - X_C}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the total impedance is

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z = R + jX&lt;/math&gt;

== Combining impedances ==
{{Main|Series and parallel circuits}}

The total impedance of many simple networks of components can be calculated using the rules for combining impedances in series and parallel. The rules are identical to those used for combining resistances, except that the numbers in general will be complex numbers. In the general case, however, [[equivalent impedance transforms]] in addition to series and parallel will be required.

=== Series combination ===

For components connected in series, the current through each circuit element is the same; the total impedance is the sum of the component impedances.

[[File:Impedances in series.svg]]

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{eq}} = Z_1 + Z_2 + \cdots + Z_n \quad&lt;/math&gt;

Or explicitly in real and imaginary terms:
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{eq}} = R + jX = (R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_n) + j(X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n) \quad&lt;/math&gt;

=== Parallel combination ===

For components connected in parallel, the voltage across each circuit element is the same; the ratio of currents through any two elements is the inverse ratio of their impedances.

:[[File:Impedances in parallel.svg]]

Hence the inverse total impedance is the sum of the inverses of the component impedances:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Z_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{Z_n}&lt;/math&gt;

or, when n = 2:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Z_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2} = \frac{Z_1 + Z_2}{Z_1 Z_2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{eq}} = \frac{Z_1 Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent impedance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_{\text{eq}}&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated in terms of the equivalent series resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_{\text{eq}}&lt;/math&gt; and reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_{\text{eq}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/imped.html#c3 Parallel Impedance Expressions], Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Z_{\text{eq}} &amp;= R_{\text{eq}} + j X_{\text{eq}} \\
  R_{\text{eq}} &amp;= \frac{(X_1 R_2 + X_2 R_1) (X_1 + X_2) + (R_1 R_2 - X_1 X_2) (R_1 + R_2)}{(R_1 + R_2)^2 + (X_1 + X_2)^2} \\
  X_{\text{eq}} &amp;= \frac{(X_1 R_2 + X_2 R_1) (R_1 + R_2) - (R_1 R_2 - X_1 X_2) (X_1 + X_2)}{(R_1 + R_2)^2 + (X_1 + X_2)^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Measurement ==
The measurement of the impedance of devices and transmission lines is a practical problem in [[radio]] technology and other fields. Measurements of impedance may be carried out at one frequency, or the variation of device impedance over a range of frequencies may be of interest. The impedance may be measured or displayed directly in ohms, or other values related to impedance may be displayed; for example, in a [[radio antenna]], the [[standing wave ratio]] or [[reflection coefficient]] may be more useful than the impedance alone. The measurement of impedance requires the measurement of the magnitude of voltage and current, and the phase difference between them. Impedance is often measured by [[Bridge circuit |&quot;bridge&quot; methods]], similar to the direct-current [[Wheatstone bridge]]; a calibrated reference impedance is adjusted to balance off the effect of the impedance of the device under test. Impedance measurement in power electronic devices may require simultaneous measurement and provision of power to the operating device.

The impedance of a device can be calculated by complex division of the voltage and current. The impedance of the device can be calculated by applying a sinusoidal voltage to the device in series with a resistor, and measuring the voltage across the resistor and across the device. Performing this measurement by sweeping the frequencies of the applied signal provides the impedance phase and magnitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisJr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |authors=George Lewis Jr., George K.

The use of an impulse response may be used in combination with the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) to rapidly measure the electrical impedance of various electrical devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisJr&quot;/&gt;

The [[LCR meter]] (Inductance (L), Capacitance (C), and Resistance (R)) is a device commonly used to measure the inductance, resistance and capacitance of a component; from these values, the impedance at any frequency can be calculated.

== Variable impedance ==
In general, neither impedance nor admittance can be time varying as they are defined for complex exponentials for –∞ &lt; ''t'' &lt; +∞. If the complex exponential voltage–current ratio changes over time or amplitude, the circuit element cannot be described using the frequency domain. However, many systems (e.g., [[varicap]]s that are used in [[Tuner (radio)|radio tuners]]) may exhibit non-linear or time-varying voltage–current ratios that appear to be [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant (LTI)]] for small signals over small observation windows; hence, they can be roughly described as having a time-varying impedance. That is, this description is an approximation; over large signal swings or observation windows, the voltage–current relationship is non-LTI and cannot be described by impedance.

In electrical and electronic systems, '''reactance''' is the opposition of a circuit element to a ''change'' in [[electric current|current]] or [[voltage]], due to that element's [[inductance]] or [[capacitance]]. A built-up [[electric field]] resists the change of voltage on the element, while a [[magnetic field]] resists the change of current. The notion of reactance is similar to [[electrical resistance]], but it differs in several respects.

In [[phasor]] analysis, reactance is used to compute amplitude and phase changes of [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] [[alternating current]] going through a circuit element.  It is denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}&lt;/math&gt;. An ideal [[resistor]] has zero reactance, whereas ideal [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s have zero resistance &amp;ndash; that is, respond to current only by reactance. The magnitude of the reactance of an inductor rises in proportion to a rise in frequency, while the  magnitude of the reactance of a capacitor decreases in proportion to a rise in frequency (or increases in proportion to wavelength). As frequency goes up, inductive reactance goes up and capacitive reactance goes down. 

== Capacitive reactance ==
{{main|Capacitance}}
A capacitor consists of two [[Electrical conduction|conductor]]s separated by an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], also known as a [[dielectric]].

''Capacitive reactance'' is an opposition to the change of voltage across an element. Capacitive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_C}&lt;/math&gt; is [[inversely proportional]] to the signal [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{f}&lt;/math&gt; (or [[angular frequency]] ω) and the [[capacitance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{C}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irwin&quot;&gt;Irwin, D. (2002). ''Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis'', page 274. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two choices in the literature for defining reactance for a capacitor. One is to use a uniform notion of reactance as the imaginary part of impedance, in which case the reactance of a capacitor is a negative number:&lt;ref name=&quot;Irwin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayt, W.H., Kimmerly J.E. (2007). ''Engineering Circuit Analysis'', 7th ed., McGraw-Hill, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Glisson&quot;&gt;Glisson, T.H. (2011). ''Introduction to Circuit Analysis and Design'', Springer, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;X_C = -\frac {1} {\omega C} = -\frac {1} {2\pi f C}&lt;/math&gt;

Another choice is to define capacitive reactance as a positive number,&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz P., Hill W. (2015). ''[[The Art of Electronics]]'', 3rd ed., p. 42&lt;/reF&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes&quot;&gt;Hughes E., Hiley J., Brown K., Smith I.McK., (2012). ''Hughes Electrical and Electronic Technology'', 11th edition, Pearson, pp. 237-241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, A.H., Miller W. (2012). ''Circuit Analysis: Theory and Practice'', 5th ed., Cengage Learning, pp. 554-558&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;X_C = \frac {1} {\omega C} = \frac {1} {2\pi f C}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case however one needs to remember to add a negative sign for the impedance of a capacitor, i.e. &lt;math&gt;Z_c=-jX_c&lt;/math&gt;.

This article uses the former definition throughout.

At low frequencies a capacitor is an [[wikt:open circuit|open circuit]] so no [[Electric current|current]] flows in the dielectric.

A [[Direct current|DC]] voltage applied across a capacitor causes positive [[Electrical charge|charge]] to accumulate on one side and negative [[Electrical charge|charge]] to accumulate on the other side; the [[electric field]] due to the accumulated charge is the source of the opposition to the current. When the [[potential]] associated with the charge exactly balances the applied voltage, the current goes to zero.

Driven by an AC supply, a capacitor will only accumulate a limited amount of charge before the potential difference changes polarity and the charge dissipates.  The higher the frequency, the less charge will accumulate and the smaller the opposition to the current.

== Inductive reactance ==
{{main|Inductance}}

Inductive reactance is a property exhibited by an inductor, and inductive reactance exists based on the fact that an electric current produces a magnetic field around it. In the context of an AC circuit (although this concept applies any time current is changing), this magnetic field is constantly changing as a result of current that oscillates back and forth. It is this change in magnetic field that induces another electric current to flow in the same wire, in a direction such as to oppose the flow of the current originally responsible for producing the magnetic field (known as Lenz’s Law). Hence, ''inductive reactance'' is an opposition to the change of current through an element. 

For an ideal inductor in an AC circuit, the inhibitive effect on change in current flow results in a delay, or a phase shift, of the alternating current with respect to alternating voltage. Specifically, an ideal inductor (with no resistance) will cause the current to lag the voltage by a quarter cycle, or 90°. 

In electric power systems, inductive reactance (and capacitive reactance, however inductive reactance is more common) can limit the power capacity of an AC transmission line, because power is not completely transferred when voltage and current are out-of-phase (detailed above). That is, current will flow for an out-of-phase system, however real power at certain times will not be transferred, because there will be points during which instantaneous current is positive while instantaneous voltage is negative, or vice versa, implying negative power transfer. Hence, real work is not performed when power transfer is “negative”. However, current still flows even when a system is out-of-phase, which causes transmission lines to heat up due to current flow. Consequently, transmission lines can only heat up so much (or else they would physically &quot;sag&quot; too much), so transmission line operators have a “ceiling” on the amount of current that can flow through a given line, and excessive inductive reactance can limit the power capacity of a line.

Inductive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_L}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the sinusoidal signal [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{f}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[inductance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{L}&lt;/math&gt;, which depends on the physical shape of the inductor.
:&lt;math&gt;X_L = \omega L = 2\pi f L&lt;/math&gt;

The average current flowing through an [[inductance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{L}&lt;/math&gt; in series with a [[sinusoidal]] AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{A}&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{f}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;I_L = {A \over \omega L} = {A \over 2\pi f L}.&lt;/math&gt;

Because a [[square wave]] has multiple amplitudes at sinusoidal [[harmonic]]s, the average current flowing through an [[inductance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{L}&lt;/math&gt; in series with a square wave AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{A}&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{f}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;I_L = {A \pi^2 \over 8 \omega L} = {A\pi \over 16 f L}&lt;/math&gt;
making it appear as if the inductive reactance to a square wave was about 19% smaller &lt;math&gt;X_L = {16 \over \pi} f L&lt;/math&gt;  than the reactance to the AC sine wave:

Any conductor of finite dimensions has inductance; the inductance is made larger by the multiple turns in an [[electromagnetic coil]].  [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] of electromagnetic induction gives the counter-[[Electromotive force|emf]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathcal{E}}&lt;/math&gt; (voltage opposing current) due to a rate-of-change of [[magnetic flux density]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{B}&lt;/math&gt; through a current loop.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -{{d\Phi_B} \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

For an inductor consisting of a coil with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle N&lt;/math&gt; loops this gives.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -N{d\Phi_B \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The counter-emf is the source of the opposition to current flow.  A constant [[direct current]] has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a [[short-circuit]] (it is typically made from a material with a low [[resistivity]]).  An [[alternating current]] has a time-averaged rate-of-change  that is proportional to frequency, this causes the increase in inductive reactance with frequency.

== Impedance ==
{{main|Impedance}}
Both reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}&lt;/math&gt; and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{R}&lt;/math&gt; are components of [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;Z = R + jX&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*&lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], measured in [[ohm]]s;
*&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], measured in ohms. It is the real part of the impedance: &lt;math&gt;{R=\Re{(Z)}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the reactance, measured in ohms. It is the imaginary part of the impedance: &lt;math&gt;{X=\Im{(Z)}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[square root of minus one]], usually represented by &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in non-electrical formulas (&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is used so as not to confuse the imaginary unit with current, commonly represented by &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;).

When both a capacitor and an inductor are placed in series in a circuit, their contributions to the total circuit impedance are opposite. Capacitive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_C}&lt;/math&gt; and inductive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_L}&lt;/math&gt; contribute to the total reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}&lt;/math&gt; as follows.
:&lt;math&gt;{X = X_L + X_C = \omega L -\frac {1} {\omega C}}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_L}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Inductance|inductive]] reactance, measured in ohms;
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_C}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Capacitance|capacitive]] reactance, measured in ohms;
*&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency, &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; times the frequency in Hz.

Hence:&lt;ref name=&quot;Glisson&quot;/&gt;
*if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the total reactance is said to be inductive;
*if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the impedance is purely resistive;
*if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the total reactance is said to be capacitive.

Note however that if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_C}&lt;/math&gt; are assumed both positive by definition, then the intermediary formula changes to a difference:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{X = X_L - X_C = \omega L -\frac {1} {\omega C}}&lt;/math&gt;

but the ultimate value is the same.

=== Phase relationship ===

The phase of the voltage across a purely reactive device (a capacitor with an infinite resistance or an inductor with a resistance of zero) ''lags'' the current by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\pi/2}&lt;/math&gt; radians for a capacitive reactance and ''leads'' the current by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\pi/2}&lt;/math&gt; radians for an inductive reactance. Without knowledge of both the resistance and reactance the relationship between voltage and current cannot be determined.

The origin of the different signs for capacitive and inductive reactance is the phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{\pm j{\pi \over 2}}&lt;/math&gt; in the impedance.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \tilde{Z}_C &amp;= {1 \over \omega C}e^{j(-{\pi \over 2})} = j\left({ -\frac{1}{\omega C}}\right) = jX_C \\
  \tilde{Z}_L &amp;= \omega Le^{j{\pi \over 2}} = j\omega L = jX_L\quad
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For a reactive component the sinusoidal voltage across the component is in quadrature (a &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\pi/2}&lt;/math&gt; phase difference) with the sinusoidal current through the component. The component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit, thus a pure reactance does not dissipate power.

{{Wiktionary}}

In astronomy, '''luminosity''' is the total amount of energy emitted by a [[star]], [[galaxy]], or other [[astronomical object]] per unit time.&lt;ref name=Hopkins1980&gt;{{cite book |last=Hopkins |first=Jeanne |title=Glossary of Astronomy and Astrophysics |edition=2nd |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |date=1980 |isbn=0-226-35171-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the brightness, which is the luminosity of an object in a given spectral region.&lt;ref name=Hopkins1980 /&gt;

In [[SI]] units luminosity is measured in [[joules]] per second or [[watt]]s. Values for luminosity are often given in the terms of the luminosity of the [[Sun]], which has a total power output of {{val|3.846|e=26|u=[[Watt|W]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=David R. |title=Sun Fact Sheet — Sun/Earth Comparison |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date=1 July 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol for [[solar luminosity]] is L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;. Luminosity can also be given in terms of magnitude. The [[Absolute magnitude#Bolometric magnitude|absolute bolometric magnitude]] (M&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt;) of an object is a logarithmic measure of its total energy emission.

== Measuring luminosity ==
[[File:Hertzsprung-Russel StarData.png|thumb|230px|right|[[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] identifying stellar luminosity as a function of temperature for many stars in our solar neighborhood.]]In [[astronomy]], ''luminosity'' is the amount of [[Radiant energy|electromagnetic energy]] a body radiates per unit of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUSTRALIA2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Luminosity of Stars |publisher=[[Australia Telescope National Facility]]|url=http://outreach.atnf.csiro.au/education/senior/astrophysics/photometry_luminosity.html |date=12 July 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809120004/http://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach//education/senior/astrophysics/photometry_specparallax.html |archivedate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most frequently measured in two forms: ''visual'' (visible light only) and ''bolometric'' (total radiant energy),&lt;ref name=&quot;COSMOS1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Luminosity |publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]] |url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/L/Luminosity |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although luminosities at other wavelengths are increasingly being used as instruments become available to measure them. A [[bolometer]] is the instrument used to measure [[radiant energy]] over a wide band by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and measurement of heating.  When not qualified, the term &quot;luminosity&quot; means bolometric luminosity, which is measured either in the [[SI]] units, [[watt]]s, or in terms of [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]]. A star also radiates [[neutrino]]s, which carry off some energy (about 2% in the case of our Sun), contributing to the star's total luminosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;BAHCALL1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Bahcall |authorlink=John N. Bahcall |url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/SNviewgraphs/snviewgraphs.html |title=Solar Neutrino Viewgraphs |publisher=[[Institute for Advanced Study]] School of Natural Science |accessdate=2012-07-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While bolometers do exist, they cannot be used to measure even the apparent brightness of a star because they are insufficiently sensitive across the electromagnetic spectrum and because most wavelengths do not reach the surface of the Earth.  In practice bolometric magnitudes are measured by taking measurements at certain wavelengths and constructing a model of the total spectrum that is most likely to match those measurements.  In some cases, the process of estimation is extreme, with luminosities being calculated when less than 1% of the energy output is observed, for example with a hot [[Wolf-Rayet star]] observed only in the infra-red.

== Stellar luminosity ==
A star's luminosity can be determined from two stellar characteristics: size and [[effective temperature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AUSTRALIA2004&quot; /&gt; The former is typically represented in terms of solar [[radius|radii]], R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, while the latter is represented in [[kelvin]]s, but in most cases neither can be measured directly.  To determine a star's radius, two other metrics are needed: the star's [[angular diameter]] and its distance from Earth, often calculated using [[parallax]].  Both can be measured with great accuracy in certain cases, with cool supergiants often having large angular diameters, and some cool evolved stars having masers in their atmospheres that can be used to measure the parallax using [[VLBI]].  However for most stars the angular diameter or parallax, or both, are far below our ability to measure with any certainty.  Since the effective temperature is merely a number that represents the temperature of a black body that would reproduce the luminosity, it obviously cannot be measured directly, but it can be estimated from the spectrum.

An alternate way to measure stellar luminosity is to measure the star's apparent brightness and distance.  A third component needed to derive the luminosity is the degree of [[Extinction (astronomy)|interstellar extinction]] that is present, a condition that usually arises because of gas and dust present in the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM), the [[Earth's atmosphere]], and [[circumstellar dust|circumstellar matter]].  Consequently, one of astronomy's central challenges in determining a star's luminosity is to derive accurate measurements for each of these components, without which an accurate luminosity figure remains elusive.&lt;ref name=&quot;KARTTUNEN1&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Karttunen  | first1 = Hannu  | title = Fundamental Astronomy  | publisher = Springer-Verlag  | date = 2003  | page = 289  | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OEhHqwW-kgQC |deadurl=no | isbn = 978-3-540-00179-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extinction can only be measured directly if the actual and observed luminosities are both known, but it can be estimated from the observed colour of a star, using models of the expected level of reddening from the interstellar medium.

In the current system of [[stellar classification]], stars are grouped according to temperature, with the massive, very young and energetic [[O-type main sequence star|Class O]] stars boasting temperatures in excess of 30,000&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] while the less massive, typically older [[Stellar classification#Class M|Class M]] stars exhibit temperatures less than 3,500&amp;nbsp;K. Because luminosity is proportional to temperature to the fourth power, the large variation in stellar temperatures produces an even vaster variation in stellar luminosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEDREW1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ledrew, Glenn | title=The Real Starry Sky | journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |date=February 2001 | volume=95 | pages=32–33 | url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2001JRASC..95...32L&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf | accessdate=2 July 2012 | bibcode=2001JRASC..95...32L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the luminosity depends on a high power of the stellar mass, high mass luminous stars have much shorter lifetimes.  The most luminous stars are always young stars, no more than a few million years for the most extreme.  In the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], the x-axis represents temperature or spectral type while the y-axis represents luminosity or magnitude.  The vast majority of stars are found along the [[main sequence]] with blue Class 0 stars found at the top left of the chart while red Class M stars fall to the bottom right.  Certain stars like [[Deneb]] and [[Betelgeuse]] are found above and to the right of the main sequence, more luminous or cooler than their equivalents on the main sequence.  Increased luminosity at the same temperature, or alternatively cooler temperature at the same luminosity, indicates that these stars are larger than those on the main sequence and they are called giants or supergiants.

Blue and white supergiants are high luminosity stars somewhat cooler than the most luminous main sequence stars.  A star like Deneb, for example, has a luminosity around 200,000 L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, a spectral type of A2, and an effective temperature around 8,500&amp;nbsp;K, meaning it has a radius around 203 R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;. For comparison, the red supergiant Betelgeuse has a luminosity around 100,000 L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, a spectral type of M2, and a temperature around 3,500&amp;nbsp;K, meaning its radius is about 1,000 R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;. Red supergiants are the largest type of star, but the most luminous are much smaller and hotter, with temperatures up to 50,000&amp;nbsp;K and more and luminosities of several million L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning their radii are just a few tens of R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;.  An example is [[R136a1]], over 50,000&amp;nbsp;K and shining at over 8,000,000 L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; (mostly in the UV), it is only 35 R&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Radio luminosity ==
The luminosity of a [[Astronomical radio source|radio source]] is measured in {{math|W Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, to avoid having to specify a [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] over which it is measured. The observed strength, or [[flux density]], of a radio source is measured in [[Jansky]] where  {{math|1 Jy {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt; W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

For example, consider a 10W transmitter at a distance of 1 million metres, radiating over a bandwidth of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz. By the time that power has reached the observer, the power is spread over the surface of a sphere with area {{math|4{{pi}}''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} or about {{math|1.26×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so its flux density is {{math|10 / 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; / 1.26×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Jy}}.

More generally, for sources at cosmological distances, a [[k-correction]] must be made for the spectral index α of the source, and a relativistic correction must be made for the fact that the frequency scale in the emitted [[rest frame]] is different from that in the observers [[rest frame]]. So the full expression for radio luminosity, assuming [[isotropic]] emission, is

:&lt;math&gt;L_{\nu} = \frac{S_{\mathrm{obs}} 4 \pi {D_{L}}^{2}}{(1+z)^{1+\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the luminosity in {{math|W Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; is the observed [[flux density]] in {{math|W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[luminosity distance]] in metres, ''z'' is the redshift, ''&amp;alpha;'' is the [[spectral index]] (in the sense &lt;math&gt;I \propto{\nu}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, and is typically -0.7).

For example, consider a 1 Jy signal from a radio source at a [[redshift]] of 1, at a frequency of 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz.
[http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html Ned Wright's cosmology calculator] calculates a [[luminosity distance]] for a redshift of 1 to be 6701 Mpc =  2×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; m
giving a radio luminosity of {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt; × 4{{pi}}(2×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / (1+1)&lt;sup&gt;(1-0.7)&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 4×10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; W Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

To calculate the total radio power, this luminosity must be integrated over the bandwidth of the emission. A common assumption is to set the bandwidth to the observing frequency, which effectively assumes the power radiated has uniform  intensity from zero frequency up to the observing frequency. In the case above, the total power is {{math|4×10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; × 1.4×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 5.7×10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; W}}. This is sometimes expressed in terms of the total (i.e. integrated over all wavelengths) luminosity of the [[Sun]] which is {{math|3.86×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; W}}, giving a radio power of {{math|1.5×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; L&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

A useful [http://www.astro.soton.ac.uk/~td/flux_convert.html radio luminosity calculator] has been provided by the [[University of Southampton]].

Luminosity is an intrinsic measurable property of a star independent of distance. The concept of magnitude, on the other hand, incorporates distance. First conceived by the Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]] in the second century BC, the original concept of magnitude grouped stars into six discrete categories depending on how bright they appeared. The brightest first magnitude stars were twice as bright as the next brightest stars, which were second magnitude; second was twice as bright as third, third twice as bright as fourth and so on down to the faintest stars, which Hipparchus categorized as sixth magnitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;KNOWLE2001&quot;/&gt; The system was but a simple delineation of stellar brightness into six distinct groups and made no allowance for the variations in brightness within a group. With the invention of the [[telescope]] at the beginning of the seventeenth century, researchers soon realized that there were subtle variations among stars and millions fainter than the sixth magnitude—hence the need for a more sophisticated system to describe a continuous range of values beyond what the naked eye could see.&lt;ref name=&quot;KNOWLE2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ASTRONOTES1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 1856 [[Norman Pogson]], noticing that [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] measurements had established first magnitude stars as being about 100 times brighter than sixth magnitude stars, formalized the Hipparchus system by creating a [[logarithmic scale]], with every interval of one magnitude equating to a variation in brightness of 100&lt;sup&gt;1/5&lt;/sup&gt; or roughly 2.512 times. Consequently, a first magnitude star is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude star, 2.5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; brighter than a third magnitude star, 2.5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; brighter than a fourth magnitude star, et cetera. Based on this continuous scale, any star with a magnitude between 5.5 and 6.5 is now considered to be sixth magnitude, a star with a magnitude between 4.5 and 5.5 is fifth magnitude and so on. With this new mathematical rigor, a first magnitude star should then have a magnitude in the range 0.5 to 1.5, thus excluding the [[List of brightest stars|nine brightest stars]] with magnitudes lower than 0.5, as well as the four brightest with negative values. It is customary therefore to extend the definition of a first magnitude star to any star with a magnitude less than 0.5, as can be seen in accompanying table.&lt;ref name=&quot;KNOWLE2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The [[apparent magnitude]] is a measure of the diminishing flux of light as a result of distance according to the [[inverse-square law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HAWAII2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this brightness decrease from increased distance, there is an extra decrease of brightness due to extinction from intervening interstellar dust.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASTRONOTES1&quot;/&gt;

By measuring the width of certain absorption lines in the [[stellar classification|stellar spectrum]], it is often possible to assign a certain luminosity class to a star without knowing its distance. Thus a fair measure of its absolute magnitude can be determined without knowing its distance nor the interstellar extinction, allowing astronomers to estimate a star's distance and extinction without [[parallax]] calculations. Since the [[stellar parallax]] is usually too small to be measured for many distant stars, this is a common method of determining such distances.

To conceptualize the range of magnitudes in our own [[Milky Way|galaxy]], the smallest star to be identified has about 8% of the Sun’s mass and glows feebly at absolute magnitude +19. Compared to the Sun, which has an absolute of +4.8, this faint star is 14 magnitudes or 400,000 times dimmer than our Sun. Our galaxy's most massive stars begin their lives with masses of roughly 100 times solar, radiating at upwards of absolute magnitude –8, over 160,000 times the solar luminosity. The total range of stellar luminosities, then, occupies a range of 27 magnitudes, or a factor of 60 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEDREW1&quot; /&gt;

In measuring star brightnesses, absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and distance are interrelated parameters—if two are known, the third can be determined. Since the Sun's luminosity is the standard, comparing these parameters with the Sun's apparent magnitude and distance is the easiest way to remember how to convert between them.

== Luminosity formula ==
[[File:Inverse square law.svg|right|thumb|Point source ''S'' is radiating light equally in all directions. The amount passing through an area ''A'' varies with the distance of the surface from the light.]]
The [[Stefan–Boltzmann law|Stefan–Boltzmann]] equation applied to a [[black body]] gives the value for luminosity for a black body, an idealized object which is perfectly opaque and non-reflecting:&lt;ref name=&quot;AUSTRALIA2004&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L= \sigma A T^4&lt;/math&gt; ,

where A is the area, T is the temperature (in Kelvins) and σ is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]], with a value of {{physconst|sigma|after=.}}

Imagine a point source of light of luminosity &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; that radiates equally in all directions. A hollow [[sphere]] centered on the point would have its entire interior surface illuminated. As the radius increases, the surface area will also increase, and the constant luminosity has more surface area to illuminate, leading to a decrease in observed brightness.

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{L}{A}&lt;/math&gt; ,
where
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the illuminated surface.
:&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[flux density]] of the illuminated surface.

The surface area of a sphere with radius ''r'' is &lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;, so for stars and other point sources of light: 
:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{L}{4\pi r^2} \,&lt;/math&gt; ,
where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the observer to the light source.

It has been shown that the luminosity of a star &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (assuming the star is a [[black body]], which is a good approximation) is also related to temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of the star by the equation:&lt;ref name=&quot;AUSTRALIA2004&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi R^2\sigma T^4 \,&lt;/math&gt; ,
where
:&amp;sigma; is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]] 5.67{{e|&amp;minus;8}} [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;.

Dividing by the [[Solar luminosity|luminosity of the Sun]] &lt;math&gt;L_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt; and cancelling constants, we obtain the relationship:&lt;ref name=&quot;AUSTRALIA2004&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = {\left ( \frac{R}{R_{\odot}} \right )}^2 {\left ( \frac{T}{T_{\odot}} \right )}^4&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;R_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt; are the radius and temperature of the Sun, respectively.

For stars on the [[main sequence]], luminosity is also [[mass–luminosity relation|related to mass]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \approx {\left ( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \right )}^{3.5}&lt;/math&gt; .

== Magnitude formulae ==

=== Apparent ===
The magnitude of a star is a logarithmic scale of observed visible brightness. The apparent magnitude is the observed visible brightness from [[Earth]], and the absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at a distance of 10 parsecs.
Given a visible luminosity (not total luminosity), one can calculate the apparent magnitude of a star from a given distance (ignoring extinction):

:&lt;math&gt;m_{\rm star}=m_\odot-2.5\log_{10}\left[\frac{L_{\rm star}}{L_\odot}\left(\frac{d_\odot}{d_{\rm star}}\right)^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{star}&lt;/math&gt; is the apparent magnitude of the star (a pure number)
:&lt;math&gt;m_\odot&lt;/math&gt; is the apparent magnitude of the Sun (also a pure number)
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{star}&lt;/math&gt; is the visible luminosity of the star
:&lt;math&gt;L_\odot&lt;/math&gt; is the solar visible luminosity
:&lt;math&gt;d_\text{star}&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the star
:&lt;math&gt;d_\odot&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the Sun

Or simplified, given &lt;math&gt;m_\odot=-26.73&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_\odot = 1.58{\times}10^{-5}\,\text{lyr}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;m_\text{star}=-2.72-2.5\,\log(L_\text{star}/d_\text{star}^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_\text{star}&lt;/math&gt; is measured in &lt;math&gt;L_\odot&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Bolometric ===
The difference in bolometric magnitude is related to the luminosity ratio according to:

:&lt;math&gt;M_\text{bol,star} - M_{\text{bol},\odot} = -2.5 \log_{10}\frac{L_\text{star}}{L_\odot}&lt;/math&gt;

which makes by inversion:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L_\text{star}}{L_\odot} = 10^{(M_{\text{bol},\odot} - M_\text{bol,star})/2.5}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;L_\odot&lt;/math&gt; is the Sun's (sol) luminosity (bolometric luminosity)
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{star}&lt;/math&gt; is the star's luminosity (bolometric luminosity)
:&lt;math&gt;M_{\text{bol},\odot}&lt;/math&gt; is the bolometric magnitude of the Sun
:&lt;math&gt;M_\text{bol,star}&lt;/math&gt; is the bolometric magnitude of the star.

== Computational challenges ==
&lt;!----------This section has been referenced by the Betelgeuse article---------&gt;
Calculating a star's luminosity and magnitude is sometimes a tremendous astrophysical challenge.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Although the formulae are well understood, obtaining accurate data to plug into those formulae is not always easy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}  This is particularly the case for enigmatic stars like [[Betelgeuse]] whose thick circumstellar nebula {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} makes it difficult to identify the size and shape of the star's [[photosphere]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}, leading to significant error factors in determining its luminosity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

As already discussed, the calculation of stellar brightness requires three variables: angular diameter, distance and temperature.  A wide variance in any of these components will lead to significant error factors in the star's luminosity.  In the last century, there has been a noticeable variance in all 3 components, leading to much debate on the star's actual brightness.  In 1920 when the photosphere was first measured, the published angular diameter was 0.047 [[arcseconds]], a measurement which resulted in a diameter of 3.84&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km (2.58 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]]) based on the then-current [[stellar parallax|parallax]] value of 0.018[[arcsecond|&quot;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MICHELSON&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Michelson, Albert Abraham| author2=Pease, Francis G. | title=Measurement of the diameter of alpha Orionis with the interferometer | journal=Astrophysical Journal | date=1921 | volume=53 | pages=249–59 | doi = 10.1086/142603 | bibcode = 1921ApJ....53..249M | quote=The 0.047 arcsecond measurement was for a uniform disk.

To determine the star's luminosity, there are 3 computational steps:&lt;br/&gt;
:1) convert the star's [[angular diameter]] in arcseconds into its radius in [[astronomical units]] ('''AU''');
:2) convert the star's radius in '''AU''' into its solar radius &lt;math&gt;R_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt;; and finally
:3) convert its solar radius &lt;math&gt;R_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt; and temperature (kelvin) into solar luminosity&lt;math&gt;L_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Arcseconds to AU ===

The calculations begin with the formula for a star's angular diameter, as follows:
&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;If: {\delta} = \frac{d_B}{D_B} \qquad Then:d_B = \delta \cdot D_B \quad And: R_B ={\left ( {\frac {\delta \cdot D_B}{2}} \right )}&lt;/math&gt;
where
'''&lt;math&gt;{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;''' represents Betelgeuse's angular diameter in arcseconds,
'''&lt;math&gt;{D_B}&lt;/math&gt;''' the &lt;big&gt;'''D'''&lt;/big&gt;istance from Earth in parsecs &lt;br /&gt;
'''&lt;math&gt;{d_B}&lt;/math&gt;''' Betelgeuse's &lt;big&gt;'''d'''&lt;/big&gt;iameter in AU, and
'''&lt;math&gt;{R_B}&lt;/math&gt;''' Betelgeuse's &lt;big&gt;'''R'''&lt;/big&gt;adius in AU.  Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;Scenario \quad I: \qquad R_B = {\left ( {\frac {{0.05660} \cdot 197.0}{2}} \right )} = 5.582 AU = 5.6 AU&lt;/math&gt; (rounded)
:&lt;math&gt;Scenario \ II: \qquad R_B = {\left ( {\frac {{0.04333} \cdot 152.0}{2}} \right )} = 3.308 AU = 3.3 AU&lt;/math&gt; (rounded)

To convert the above into solar units, the math is straightforward. Since 1 AU = 149,597,871&amp;nbsp;km and the mean diameter of the Sun = 1,392,000&amp;nbsp;km (hence a mean radius of 696,000&amp;nbsp;km), the calculation is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Scenario I}: \qquad d_B = {\left ( {\frac {149,597,871\,\textrm{km}}{696,000\,\textrm{km}}} \right )} {\left ( 5.6\,\textrm{AU} \right )} = 1,204 R_{\odot}\quad(\text{rounded})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Scenario II}: \qquad d_B = {\left ( {\frac {149,597,871\,\textrm{km}}{696,000\,\textrm{km}}} \right )} {\left ( 3.3\,\textrm{AU} \right )} = \quad 710 R_{\odot}\quad(\text{rounded})&lt;/math&gt;

==={{Solar radius}} to {{Solar luminosity}} ===

Incorporating the {{Solar radius}} results into the luminosity formula outlined earlier where B = Betelgeuse, L = Luminosity, R = Radius and T = Temperature, we can calculate Betelgeuse's luminosity per each scenario, as follows:
&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Scenario \quad I: \qquad \frac{L_{\rm B}}{L_{\odot}} = {\left ( {\frac{1,204}{1}} \right )}^2 {\left ( {\frac{3,300}{5,778}} \right )}^4 = 154,000 L_{\odot} (rounded)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Scenario \ II: \qquad \frac{L_{\rm B}}{L_{\odot}} = \quad {\left ( {\frac{730}{1}} \right )}^2 {\left ( {\frac{3,641}{5,778}} \right )}^4 = \ 84,000 L_{\odot} (rounded)&lt;/math&gt;

These luminosity calculations do not take into consideration error factors relating to angular diameter or distance measurements nor any diminution caused by extinction, which in the case of Betelgeuse has been estimated at around 3.1%.  Also, while the calculations are correct and useful, in practice they are often performed in reverse because the distance to most stars{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}, and hence their size, cannot be determined directly while quantities such as the luminosity and temperature can be estimated from other observable quantities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[File:FrequencyAnimation.gif|thumb|Three cyclically flashing dots from lowest frequency (top) to highest frequency (bottom). For each dot, {{nowrap|&quot;f&quot; is}} the frequency in [[hertz]] (Hz)&amp;nbsp;– meaning the number of times per second (i.e. cycles per second) that it flashes&amp;nbsp;– while {{nowrap|&quot;T&quot; is}} the flashes' period in seconds (s), meaning the number of seconds per cycle. Each {{nowrap|T and}} f are [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]].]]

'''Frequency''' is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit [[time]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frequency&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as '''temporal frequency''', which emphasizes the contrast to [[spatial frequency]] and [[angular frequency]]. The '''period''' is the duration of time of one [[Turn (geometry)|cycle]] in a repeating event, so the period is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the frequency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/period&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its period&amp;nbsp;– the interval between beats&amp;nbsp;– is half a second (60&amp;nbsp;seconds (i.e., a minute) divided by 120 [[heart sound|beat]]s).  Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of [[oscillation|oscillatory]] and [[vibration|vibratory]] phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, [[audio signal|audio]] ([[sound]]) signals, [[radio wave]]s, and [[light]].

== Definitions ==
[[File:Sine waves different frequencies.svg|thumb|As time elapses&amp;nbsp;– represented here as a movement from left to right, i.e. horizontally&amp;nbsp;– the five [[Sine wave|sinusoidal wave]]s shown vary regularly (i.e. cycle), but at different [[rate (mathematics)|rates]]. The red [[wave]] (top) has the lowest frequency (i.e. varies at the slowest rate) while the purple wave (bottom) has the highest frequency (varies at the fastest rate).]]

For [[Turn (geometry)|cyclical]] processes, such as [[rotation]], [[oscillation]]s, or [[wave]]s, frequency is defined as a number of cycles per unit time. In [[physics]] and [[engineering]] disciplines, such as [[optics]], [[acoustics]], and [[radio]], frequency is usually denoted by a Latin letter ''f'' or by the Greek letter ''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;'' or [[Nu (letter)|''ν'' (nu)]] (see e.g. [[Planck constant|Planck's formula]]).
The period, usually denoted by ''T'', is the duration of one cycle, and is the [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the frequency ''f'':
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Units ==

The [[SI derived unit|SI]] unit of frequency is the [[hertz]] (Hz), named after the German physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]]; one hertz means that an event repeats once per [[second]]. A previous name for this unit was [[cycles per second]] (cps). The [[SI]] unit for period is the second.

A traditional unit of measure used with rotating mechanical devices is [[revolutions per minute]], abbreviated r/min or rpm. 60&amp;nbsp;rpm equals one hertz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Period versus frequency ==
As a matter of convenience, longer and slower waves, such as [[ocean surface wave]]s, tend to be described by wave period rather than frequency. Short and fast waves, like [[sound|audio]] and [[radio]], are usually described by their frequency instead of period. These commonly used conversions are listed below:

== Related types of frequency ==
{{Other uses}}

* [[Angular frequency]], usually denoted by the Greek letter [[Omega (letter)|ω (omega)]], is defined as the rate of change of [[angular displacement]], ''θ'', (during rotation), or the rate of change of the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of a [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al waveform (e.g. in oscillations and waves), or as the rate of change of the [[Argument of a function|argument]] to the [[sine function]]:

::&lt;math&gt;y(t) = \sin\left( \theta(t) \right) =  \sin(\omega t) =  \sin(2 \mathrm{\pi} f t)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} \theta}{\mathrm{d} t} = \omega = 2 \mathrm{\pi} f&lt;/math&gt;

: Angular frequency is commonly measured in [[radian]]s per second (rad/s) but, for [[discrete-time signal]]s, can also be expressed as radians per sample time, which is a [[dimensionless quantity]].

* [[Spatial frequency]] is analogous to temporal frequency, but the time axis is replaced by one or more spatial displacement axes. E.g.:

::&lt;math&gt;y(t) = \sin\left( \theta(t,x) \right) = \sin(\omega t + kx)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} \theta}{\mathrm{d} x} = k&lt;/math&gt;

: [[Wavenumber]], ''k'', sometimes means the spatial frequency analogue of angular temporal frequency. In case of more than one spatial dimension, wavenumber is a vector quantity.

== In wave propagation {{anchor|Frequency of waves}} ==
{{further|Wave propagation}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hearing impairment]] --&gt;
For periodic waves in [[Dispersion relation|nondispersive media]] (that is, media in which the wave speed is independent of frequency), frequency has an inverse relationship to the [[wavelength]], ''λ'' ([[lambda]]). Even in dispersive media, the frequency ''f'' of a sinusoidal wave is equal to the [[phase velocity]] ''v'' of the [[wave]] [[division (mathematics)|divided]] by the wavelength ''λ'' of the wave:
:&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{v}{\lambda}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[special case]] of electromagnetic waves moving through a [[vacuum]], then ''v = c'', where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, and this expression becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;
f = \frac{c}{\lambda}.
&lt;/math&gt;

When [[waves]] from a [[monochrome]] source travel from one [[medium (optics)|medium]] to another, their frequency remains the same—only their [[wavelength]] and [[phase speed|speed]] change.

== Measurement ==
{{see also|Frequency meter}}
{{split section|Frequency measurement|date=July 2015}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}

=== By counting ===
Calculating the frequency of a repeating event is accomplished by counting the number of times that event occurs within a specific time period, then dividing the count by the length of the time period. For example, if 71 events occur within 15 seconds the frequency is:
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{71}{15 \,\text{s}} \approx 4.7 \, \text{Hz}&lt;/math&gt;
If the number of counts is not very large, it is more accurate to measure the time interval for a predetermined number of occurrences, rather than the number of occurrences within a specified time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Bakshi| first = K.A. |author2=A.V. Bakshi |author3=U.A. Bakshi

  | isbn =  978-81-8431-206-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter method introduces a [[random error]] into the count of between zero and one count, so on [[average]] half a count. This is called ''gating error'' and causes an average error in the calculated frequency of   ''' ''Δf''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/(2&amp;nbsp;''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'')''', or a fractional error of ''' ''Δf''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/(2&amp;nbsp;''f&amp;nbsp;T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'')''' where '''''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is the timing interval and '''''f''''' is the measured frequency. This error decreases with frequency, so it is a problem at low frequencies where the number of counts '''''N''''' is small.

}}

=== By stroboscope ===
An older method of measuring the frequency of rotating or vibrating objects is to use a [[stroboscope]]. This is an intense repetitively flashing light ([[strobe light]]) whose frequency can be adjusted with a calibrated timing circuit. The strobe light is pointed at the rotating object and the frequency adjusted up and down. When the frequency of the strobe equals the frequency of the rotating or vibrating object, the object completes one cycle of oscillation and returns to its original position between the flashes of light, so when illuminated by the strobe the object appears stationary. Then the frequency can be read from the calibrated readout on the stroboscope. A downside of this method is that an object rotating at an integer multiple of the strobing frequency will also appear stationary.

=== By frequency counter ===
[[File:Frequency counter.jpg|thumb|Modern frequency counter]]

Higher frequencies are usually measured with a [[frequency counter]]. This is an [[electronic instrumentation|electronic instrument]] which measures the frequency of an applied repetitive electronic [[signal (electronics)|signal]] and displays the result in hertz on a [[digital display]]. It uses [[digital logic]] to count the number of cycles during a time interval established by a precision [[quartz clock|quartz]] time base. Cyclic processes that are not electrical in nature, such as the rotation rate of a shaft, mechanical vibrations, or [[sound wave]]s, can be converted to a repetitive electronic signal by [[transducer]]s and the signal applied to a frequency counter. Frequency counters can currently cover the range up to about 100&amp;nbsp;GHz. This represents the limit of direct counting methods; frequencies above this must be measured by indirect methods.

=== Heterodyne methods ===
Above the range of frequency counters, frequencies of electromagnetic signals are often measured indirectly by means of [[heterodyning]] ([[frequency changer|frequency conversion]]). A reference signal of a known frequency near the unknown frequency is mixed with the unknown frequency in a nonlinear mixing device such as a [[diode]]. This creates a [[heterodyne]] or &quot;beat&quot; signal at the difference between the two frequencies.  If the two signals are close together in frequency the heterodyne is low enough to be measured by a frequency counter. This process only measures the difference between the unknown frequency and the reference frequency, which must be determined by some other method. To reach higher frequencies, several stages of heterodyning can be used. Current research is extending this method to infrared and light frequencies ([[optical heterodyne detection]]).

== Examples ==

===Light===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Neil Harbisson]]--&gt;
[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|right|Complete spectrum of [[electromagnetic radiation]] with the visible portion highlighted]]
{{main|Light|Electromagnetic radiation}}

Visible light is an [[electromagnetic wave]], consisting of oscillating [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s traveling through space. The frequency of the wave determines its color: {{val|4|e=14|ul=Hz}} is red light, {{val|8|e=14|u=Hz}} is violet light, and between these (in the range 4-{{val|8|e=14|u=Hz}}) are all the other colors of the [[rainbow]]. An electromagnetic wave can have a frequency less than {{val|4|e=14|u=Hz}}, but it will be invisible to the human eye; such waves are called [[infrared]] (IR) radiation. At even lower frequency, the wave is called a [[microwave]], and at still lower frequencies it is called a [[radio wave]]. Likewise, an electromagnetic wave can have a frequency higher than {{val|8|e=14|u=Hz}}, but it will be invisible to the human eye; such waves are called [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation. Even higher-frequency waves are called [[X-ray]]s, and higher still are [[gamma ray]]s.

All of these waves, from the lowest-frequency radio waves to the highest-frequency gamma rays, are fundamentally the same, and they are all called [[electromagnetic radiation]]. They all travel through a vacuum at the same speed (the [[speed of light]]), giving them [[wavelength]]s inversely proportional to their frequencies.

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c=f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the speed of light (''[[speed of light|c]]'' in a vacuum, or less in other media), ''f'' is the frequency and λ is the wavelength.

In [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive media]], such as glass, the speed depends somewhat on frequency, so the wavelength is not quite inversely proportional to frequency.

=== Sound ===
{{main|Audio frequency}}
[[Sound]] propagates as mechanical vibration waves of pressure and displacement, in air or other substances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sound&lt;/ref&gt; Frequency is the property of [[sound]] that most determines [[Pitch (music)|pitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Pilhofer |first1=Michael |title=Music Theory for Dummies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CxcviUw4KX8C|year=2007|publisher=For Dummies|page=97|isbn= 9780470167946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequencies an ear can hear are limited to a [[threshold of hearing|specific range of frequencies]].  The [[audible frequency]] range for humans is typically given as being between about 20&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (20&amp;nbsp;kHz), though the high frequency limit usually reduces with age. Other [[species]] have different hearing ranges. For example, some dog breeds can perceive vibrations up to 60,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics Factbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/TimCondon.shtml|title=Frequency Range of Dog Hearing|last=Elert|first=Glenn|author2=Timothy Condon|year=2003|publisher=The Physics Factbook|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many media, such as air, the [[speed of sound]] is approximately independent of frequency, so the wavelength of the sound waves (distance between repetitions) is approximately inversely proportional to frequency.

=== Line current ===
{{main|Utility frequency}}
In [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], Southern [[South America]], most of [[Asia]], and [[Russia]], the frequency of the [[alternating current]] in [[mains electricity|household electrical outlets]] is 50&amp;nbsp;Hz (close to the [[Musical note|tone]] G), whereas in [[North America]] and Northern [[South America]], the frequency of the alternating current in household electrical outlets is 60&amp;nbsp;Hz (between the [[Musical note|tones]] B♭ and B; that is, a [[minor third]] above the European frequency). The frequency of the '[[mains hum|hum]]' in an [[audio recording]] can show where the recording was made, in countries using a European, or an American, grid frequency.

{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}

In [[physics]], a [[force]] is said to do '''work''' if, when acting on a body, there is a displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force.  For example, when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped, the work done on the ball as it falls is equal to the weight of the ball (a force) multiplied by the distance to the ground (a displacement).

The term ''work'' was introduced in 1826 by the French mathematician [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jammer | first = Max  | title = Concepts of Force | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc. | year = 1957 | isbn = 0-486-40689-X |page=167; footnote 14 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CZtEBcmOe6gC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA167,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coriolis, Gustave. (1829). ''Calculation of the Effect of Machines, or Considerations on the Use of Engines and their Evaluation'' (''Du Calcul de l'effet des Machines, ou Considérations sur l'emploi des Moteurs et sur Leur Evaluation''). Paris: Carilian-Goeury, Libraire.&lt;/ref&gt; as &quot;weight ''lifted'' through a height&quot;, which is based on the use of early steam engines to lift buckets of water out of flooded ore mines. The [[SI unit]] of work is the newton-metre or [[joule]] (J).

==Units==
The SI unit of work is the [[joule]] (J), which is defined as the work expended by a force of one [[newton (unit)|newton]] through a distance of one [[metre]].

The dimensionally equivalent [[newton-metre]] (N⋅m) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work, but this can be confused with the unit newton-metre, which is the measurement unit of [[torque]]. Usage of N⋅m is discouraged by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|SI authority]], since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque measurement, or a measurement of energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-2/2-2-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-SI units of work include the [[erg]], the [[foot-pound (energy)|foot-pound]], the [[foot-poundal]], the [[kilowatt hour]], the [[litre-atmosphere]], and the [[horsepower|horsepower-hour]].  Due to work having the same [[Dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] as [[heat]], occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content, such as [[therm]], [[BTU]] and [[Calorie]], are utilized as a measuring unit.

==Work and energy==
The work done by a constant force of magnitude ''F'' on a point that moves a displacement (not distance) ''s'' in the direction of the force is the product,
:&lt;math&gt;W = Fs.&lt;/math&gt;
For example, if a force of 10 newtons ({{nowrap|1=''F'' = 10 N}}) acts along a point that travels 2 metres ({{nowrap|1=''s'' = 2 m}}), then it does the work {{nowrap|1=''W'' = (10 N)(2 m) = 20 N m = 20 J}}.   This is approximately the work done lifting a 1&amp;nbsp;kg weight from ground to over a person's head against the force of gravity.  Notice that the work is doubled either by lifting twice the weight the same distance or by lifting the same weight twice the distance.

Work is closely related to [[energy]]. The [[law of conservation of energy]] states that the change in total internal energy of a system equals the added heat, minus the work performed by the system (see the [[first law of thermodynamics]]),
:&lt;math&gt;dE = \delta Q - \delta W,&lt;/math&gt;
where the symbol &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; indicates that heat (''Q'') and work (''W'') are [[inexact differentials]].

From [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], it can be shown that work on a free (no fields), rigid (no internal degrees of freedom) body, is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the velocity and rotation of that body,
:&lt;math&gt;W = \Delta KE.&lt;/math&gt;
The work of forces generated by a potential function is known as [[potential energy]] and the forces are said to be conservative. Therefore, work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force field, without change in velocity or rotation, is equal to ''minus'' the change of potential energy of the object,
:&lt;math&gt;W = -\Delta PE.&lt;/math&gt;
These formulas demonstrate that work is the energy associated with the action of a force, so work subsequently possesses the [[Dimensional analysis|physical dimensions]], and units, of energy.
The work/energy principles discussed here are identical to Electric work/energy principles.

==Constraint forces==
Constraint forces determine the movement of components in a system, constraining the object within a boundary (in the case of a slope plus gravity, the object is ''stuck to'' the slope, when attached to a taut string it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any 'tauter').  Constraint forces ensure the velocity in the direction of the constraint is zero, which means the constraint forces do not perform work on the system.

If the system [[Virtual work|doesn't change in time]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Goldstein, Classical Mechanics, third edition. P.19&lt;/ref&gt; they eliminate all movement in the direction of the constraint, thus constraint forces do not perform work on the system, as the velocity of that object is constrained to be 0 parallel to this force, due to this force. This only applies for a single particle system. For example, in an [[Atwood machine]], the rope does work on each body, but keeping always the net virtual work null. There are, however, cases where this is not true.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

For example, the [[centripetal force]] exerted ''inwards'' by a string on a ball in uniform [[circular motion]] ''sideways'' constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the center of the circle.  This force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ball.

Another example is a book on a table.   If external forces are applied to the book so that it slides on the table, then the force exerted by the table constrains the book from moving downwards.  The force exerted by the table supports the book and is perpendicular to its movement which means that this constraint force does not perform work.

The [[magnetic force]] on a charged particle is {{nowrap|1=F = ''q'''''v''' × '''B'''}}, where ''q'' is the charge, '''v''' is the velocity of the particle, and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. The result of a [[cross product]] is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors, so {{nowrap|'''F''' ⊥ '''v'''}}. The [[dot product]] of two perpendicular vectors is always zero, so the work {{nowrap|1=''W'' = '''F''' ⋅ '''v''' = 0}}, and the magnetic force does not do work. It can change the direction of motion but never change the speed.

==Mathematical calculation==
For moving objects, the quantity of work/time (power) is calculated. Thus, at any instant, the rate of the work done by a force (measured in joules/second, or '''watts''') is the [[scalar product]] of the force (a vector), and the velocity vector of the point of application. This scalar product of force and velocity is classified as instantaneous [[power (physics)|power]]. Just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance, by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resnick&quot;&gt;Resnick, Robert and Halliday, David (1966), ''Physics'', Section 1–3 (Vol I and II, Combined edition), Wiley International Edition, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 66-11527&lt;/ref&gt;

Work is the result of a force on a point that moves through a distance.  As the point moves, it follows a curve '''X''', with a velocity '''v''', at each instant.  The small amount of work ''δW'' that occurs over an instant of time ''dt'' is calculated as
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v}dt &lt;/math&gt;
where the {{nowrap|'''F''' ⋅ '''v'''}} is the power over the instant ''dt''.  The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work,
:&lt;math&gt;W =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v}dt =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{F} \cdot {\tfrac{d\mathbf{s}}{dt}}dt =\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' is the trajectory from '''x'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to '''x'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  This integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle, and is therefore said to be ''path dependent''.

If the force is always directed along this line, and the magnitude of the force is ''F'', then this integral simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C F\,ds&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s'' is distance along the line. If '''F''' is constant, in addition to being directed along the line, then the integral simplifies further to
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C F\,ds = F\int_C ds = Fs&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s'' is the distance travelled by the point along the line.

This calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line, followed by the particle.  In this case the [[dot product]] {{nowrap|1='''F''' ⋅ ''d'''''s''' = ''F'' cos ''θ'' ''ds''}}, where ''θ'' is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement,&lt;ref name=&quot;Resnick&quot;/&gt; that is
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s} = Fs\cos\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

In the notable case of a force applied to a body always at an angle of 90° from the velocity vector (as when a body moves in a circle under a central force), no work is done at all, since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero. Thus, no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit (this is ideal, as all orbits are slightly elliptical). Also, no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force, such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifuge.

Calculating the work as &quot;force times straight path segment&quot; would only apply in the most simple of circumstances, as noted above. If force is changing, or if the body is moving along a curved path, possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid, then only the path of the application point of the force is relevant for the work done, and only the component of the force parallel to the application point [[velocity]] is doing work (positive work when in the same direction, and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity). This component of force can be described by the scalar quantity called ''scalar tangential component'' (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle F\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the force and the velocity). And then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows:
:''Work of a force is the line integral of its scalar tangential component along the path of its application point.''

===Torque and rotation===
A [[Couple (mechanics)|force couple]] results from equal and opposite forces, acting on two different points of a rigid body.  The sum (resultant) of these forces may cancel, but their effect on the body is the couple or torque '''T'''.  The work of the torque is calculated as
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = \mathbf{T}\cdot\vec{\omega}\delta t,&lt;/math&gt;
where the {{nowrap|'''T''' ⋅ '''ω'''}} is the power over the instant ''δt''.  The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the rigid body yields the work,
:&lt;math&gt;W =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{T}\cdot\vec{\omega}dt.&lt;/math&gt;
This integral is computed along the trajectory of the rigid body with an angular velocity ω that varies with time, and is therefore said to be ''path dependent''.

If the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction, then it takes the form,
:&lt;math&gt; \vec{\omega}= \dot{\phi}\mathbf{S},&lt;/math&gt;
where φ is the angle of rotation about the constant unit vector '''S'''.  In this case, the work of the torque becomes,
:&lt;math&gt;W =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{T}\cdot\vec{\omega}dt = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{T}\cdot \mathbf{S}\frac{d\phi}{dt}dt = \int_C\mathbf{T}\cdot \mathbf{S} d\phi,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' is the trajectory from ''φ''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to ''φ''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  This integral depends on the rotational trajectory ''φ''(''t''), and is therefore path-dependent.

If the torque '''T''' is aligned with the angular velocity vector so that,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T}=\tau\mathbf{S},&lt;/math&gt;
and both the torque and angular velocity are constant, then the work takes the form,&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;W =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\tau \dot{\phi}dt = \tau(\phi_2-\phi_1).&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Work on the lever arm.jpg|right|thumb|A force of constant magnitude and perpendicular to the lever arm]]

This result can be understood more simply by considering the torque as arising from a force of constant magnitude ''F'', being applied perpendicularly to a lever arm at a distance ''r'', as shown in the figure.  This force will act through the distance along the circular arc {{nowrap|1=''s'' = ''rφ''}}, so the work done is
:&lt;math&gt;W=Fs = Fr\phi .&lt;/math&gt;
Introduce the torque {{nowrap|1=''τ'' = ''Fr''}}, to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; W=Fr\phi=\tau\phi,&lt;/math&gt;
as presented above.

Notice that only the component of torque in the direction of the angular velocity vector contributes to the work.

==Work and potential energy==
The scalar product of a force '''F''' and the velocity '''v''' of its point of application defines the [[power (physics)|power]] input to a system at an instant of time.  Integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application, {{nowrap|1=''C'' = '''x'''(''t'')}}, defines the work input to the system by the force.

===Path dependence===
Therefore, the [[mechanical work|work]] done by a force '''F''' on an object that travels along a curve ''C'' is given by the [[line integral]]:
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{x} =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v}dt,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''dx''(''t'') defines the trajectory ''C'' and '''v''' is the velocity along this trajectory.  In general this integral requires the path along which the velocity is defined, so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependent.

The time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous power,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dW}{dt} = P(t) = \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v} .&lt;/math&gt;

===Path independence===
If the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force is, by the [[gradient theorem]], the potential function evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application. Such a force is said to be [[Conservative force|conservative]]. This means that there is a potential function ''U''('''x'''), that can be evaluated at the two points '''x'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''x'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points. It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} =  \int_{\mathbf{x}(t_1)}^{\mathbf{x}(t_2)} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} =  U(\mathbf{x}(t_1))-U(\mathbf{x}(t_2)).
&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''U''('''x''') is called the [[potential energy]] associated with the applied force.  Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces.

In this case, the [[gradient]] of work yields
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial W}{\partial \mathbf{x}} =  -\frac{\partial U}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = -\big(\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial U}{\partial z}\big) = \mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt;
and the force '''F''' is said to be &quot;derivable from a potential.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Taylor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P1kCtNr-pJsC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Classical Mechanics,''] University Science Books, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the potential ''U'' defines a force '''F''' at every point '''x''' in space, the set of forces is called  a [[force field (physics)|force field]].  The power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work, or potential, in the direction of the velocity '''V''' of the body, that is
:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Work by gravity===
[[File:Work of gravity F dot d equals mgh.JPG|right|thumb|Gravity {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''mg''}} does work {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mgh''}} along any descending path]]
In the absence of other forces, gravity results in a constant downward acceleration of every freely moving object. Near Earth's surface the acceleration due to gravity is {{nowrap|1=''g'' = 9.8&amp;nbsp;m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the gravitational force on an object of mass ''m'' is {{nowrap|1='''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = ''mg''}}. It is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the center of mass of the object.

If an object is displaced upwards or downwards a vertical distance {{nowrap|''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the work ''W'' done on the object by its weight mg is:
:&lt;math&gt;W = F_g (y_2 - y_1) = F_g\Delta y = - mg\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;
where ''F&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' is weight (pounds in imperial units, and newtons in SI units), and Δ''y'' is the change in height ''y''. Notice that the work done by gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the object. The presence of friction does not affect the work done on the object by its weight.

===Work by gravity in space===
The force of gravity exerted by a mass ''M'' on another mass ''m'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}=-\frac{GMm}{r^3}\mathbf{r},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''r''' is the position vector from ''M'' to ''m''.

Let the mass ''m'' move at the velocity '''v''' then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position '''r'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to  '''r'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is given by
:&lt;math&gt; W=-\int^{\mathbf{r}(t_2)}_{\mathbf{r}(t_1)}\frac{GMm}{r^3}\mathbf{r}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=-\int^{t_2}_{t_1}\frac{GMm}{r^3}\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{v}dt.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that the position and velocity of the mass ''m'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = r\mathbf{e}_r, \qquad\mathbf{v}=\dot{r}\mathbf{e}_r + r\dot{\theta}\mathbf{e}_t,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; are the radial and tangential unit vectors directed relative to the vector from ''M'' to ''m''.  Use this to simplify the formula for work of gravity to,
:&lt;math&gt; W=-\int^{t_2}_{t_1}\frac{GmM}{r^3}(r\mathbf{e}_r)\cdot(\dot{r}\mathbf{e}_r + r\dot{\theta}\mathbf{e}_t)dt = -\int^{t_2}_{t_1}\frac{GmM}{r^3}r\dot{r}dt = \frac{GMm}{r(t_2)}-\frac{GMm}{r(t_1)}.&lt;/math&gt;
This calculation uses the fact that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt}r^{-1}=-r^{-2}\dot{r}=-\frac{\dot{r}}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The function
:&lt;math&gt; U=-\frac{GMm}{r}, &lt;/math&gt;
is the gravitational potential function, also known as [[gravitational potential energy]].  The negative sign follows the convention that work is gained from a loss of potential energy.

===Work by a spring===
[[File:Analogie ressorts contrainte.svg|upright|right|thumb|Forces in springs assembled in parallel]]

Consider a spring that exerts a horizontal force {{nowrap|1='''F''' = (−''kx'', 0, 0)}} that is proportional to its deflection in the ''x'' direction independent of how a body moves.  The work of this spring on a body moving along the space curve {{nowrap|1='''X'''(''t'') = (''x''(''t''), ''y''(''t''), ''z''(''t''))}}, is calculated using its velocity, {{nowrap|1='''v''' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int_0^t\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v}dt =-\int_0^tkx v_x dt = -\frac{1}{2}kx^2. &lt;/math&gt;
For convenience, consider contact with the spring occurs at {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}}, then the integral of the product of the distance ''x'' and the x-velocity, ''xv''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, is (1/2)''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Work by a gas===
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int_a^b{P}dV  &lt;/math&gt;
Where ''P'' is pressure, ''V'' is volume, and ''a'' and ''b'' are initial and final volumes.

==Work–energy principle==
The principle of work and [[kinetic energy]] (also known as the '''work–energy principle''') states that ''the work done by all forces acting on a particle (the work of the resultant force) equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;W=\Delta E_k=\tfrac12mv_2^2-\tfrac12mv_1^2&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; are the [[speed]]s of the particle before and after the work is done and ''m'' is its [[mass]].

The derivation of the ''work–energy principle'' begins with Newton's second law and the resultant force on a particle which includes forces applied to the particle and constraint forces imposed on its movement.  Computation of the scalar product of the forces with the velocity of the particle evaluates the instantaneous power added to the system.&lt;ref&gt;B. Paul, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=JGMfULH-KK2r2AWIzICYAw&amp;id=3UdSAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kinematics+and+dynamics+of+planar+machinery&amp;q=instantaneous+power#search_anchor ''Kinematics and Dynamics of Planar Machinery,''] Prentice-Hall, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constraints define the direction of movement of the particle by ensuring there is no component of velocity in the direction of the constraint force.   This also means the constraint forces do not add to the instantaneous power.   The time integral of this scalar equation yields work from the instantaneous power, and kinetic energy from the scalar product of velocity and acceleration.  The fact the work–energy principle eliminates the constraint forces underlies [[Lagrangian mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[E. T. Whittaker]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=OSckAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=analytical+dynamics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AGqvlTnrw7&amp;sig=x7DfbqV97-G73bWcuEFC-rU3h2s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9lobUPz8KofU2AW9sIGIDw&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''A treatise on the analytical dynamics of particles and rigid bodies,''] Cambridge University Press, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

This section focuses on the work–energy principle as it applies to particle dynamics.  In more general systems work can change the [[potential energy]] of a mechanical device, the heat energy in a thermal system, or the [[electrical energy]] in an electrical device.  Work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another.

===Derivation for a particle moving along a straight line===
In the case the [[resultant force]] '''F''' is constant in both magnitude and direction, and parallel to the velocity of the particle, the particle is moving with constant acceleration ''a'' along a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.wwu.edu/vawter/PhysicsNet/Topics/Work/WorkEngergyTheorem.html Work–energy principle]&lt;/ref&gt;  The relation between the net force and the acceleration is given by the equation ''F'' = ''ma'' ([[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law]]), and the particle [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] ''s'' can be expressed by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

which follows from &lt;math&gt;v_2^2 = v_1^2 + 2as&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Equations of motion#Uniform acceleration|Equations of motion]]).

The work of the net force is calculated as the product of its magnitude and the particle displacement. Substituting the above equations, one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;W = Fs = mas = ma \left(\frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2a}\right) = \frac{mv_2^2}{2} - \frac{mv_1^2}{2} = \Delta {E_k}&lt;/math&gt;

Other derivation:

:&lt;math&gt;W = Fs = mas = m \left(\frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2s}\right) s&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;W = m \left(\frac{0_2^2 - v_1^2}{2s}\right) s&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;W = - \frac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/math&gt;

Vertical displacement derivation

''W = F × S = mg × h''

In the general case of rectilinear motion, when the net force '''F''' is not constant in magnitude, but is constant in direction, and parallel to the velocity of the particle, the work must be integrated along the path of the particle:

:&lt;math&gt;W =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v}dt =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} F \,v dt =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} ma \,v dt = m \int_{t_1}^{t_2} v \,{dv \over dt}\,dt = m \int_{v_1}^{v_2} v\,dv = \tfrac12 m (v_2^2 - v_1^2) .&lt;/math&gt;

===General derivation of the work–energy theorem for a particle===
For any net force acting on a particle moving along any curvilinear path, it can be demonstrated that its work equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle by a simple derivation analogous to the equation above. Some authors call this result ''work–energy principle'', but it is more widely known as '''the work–energy theorem''':

:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v}dt = m \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v}dt = \frac{m}{2} \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{d v^2}{dt}\,dt = \frac{m}{2} \int_{v^2_1}^{v^2_2} d v^2 = \frac{mv_2^2}{2} - \frac{mv_1^2}{2} = \Delta {E_k} &lt;/math&gt;

The identity &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d v^2}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; requires some algebra.
From the identity &lt;math&gt;\textstyle v^2 = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; and definition &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{a} = \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;
it follows
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d v^2}{dt} = \frac{d (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v})}{dt} = \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} = 2 \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

The remaining part of the above derivation is just simple calculus, same as in the preceding rectilinear case.

===Derivation for a particle in constrained movement===
In particle dynamics, a formula equating work applied to a system to its change in kinetic energy is obtained as a first integral of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]].  It is useful to notice that the resultant force used in Newton's laws can be separated into forces that are applied to the particle and forces imposed by constraints on the movement of the particle.  Remarkably, the work of a constraint force is zero, therefore only the work of the applied forces need be considered in the work–energy principle.

To see this, consider a particle P that follows the trajectory '''X'''(''t'') with a force '''F''' acting on it.  Isolate the particle from its environment to expose constraint forces '''R''', then Newton's Law takes the form
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} + \mathbf{R} =m\ddot{\mathbf{X}}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the mass of the particle.

====Vector formulation====
Note that n dots above a vector indicates its nth [[time derivative]].
The [[scalar product]] of each side of Newton's law with the velocity vector yields
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}} = m\ddot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}},&lt;/math&gt;
because the constraint forces are perpendicular to the particle velocity.  Integrate this equation along its trajectory from the point '''X'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to the point '''X'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)  to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathbf{F}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}} dt = m\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\ddot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}}dt. &lt;/math&gt;

The left side of this equation is the work of the applied force as it acts on the particle along the trajectory from time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt; W = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathbf{F}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}} dt =    \int_{\mathbf{X}(t_1)}^{\mathbf{X}(t_2)} \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{X}.  &lt;/math&gt;
This integral is computed along the trajectory '''X'''(''t'') of the particle and is therefore path dependent.

The right side of the first integral of Newton's equations can be simplified using the following identity
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dt}(\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{X}}) = \ddot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}}, &lt;/math&gt;
(see [[product rule]] for derivation). Now it is integrated explicitly to obtain the change in kinetic energy,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta K = m\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\ddot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}}dt = \frac{m}{2}\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\frac{d}{dt}(\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{X}}) dt = \frac{m}{2}\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{X}}(t_2) - \frac{m}{2}\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{X}} (t_1) = \frac{1}{2}m \Delta \mathbf{v^{2}} , &lt;/math&gt;
where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity,
:&lt;math&gt; K = \frac{m}{2}\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot \dot{\mathbf{X}} =\frac{1}{2}m{\mathbf{v^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

====Tangential and normal components====
It is useful to resolve the velocity and acceleration vectors into tangential and normal components along the trajectory '''X'''(''t''), such that
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{X}}=v \mathbf{T},\quad\mbox{and}\quad \ddot{\mathbf{X}}=\dot{v}\mathbf{T} + v^2\kappa \mathbf{N}. &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; v=|\dot{\mathbf{X}}|=\sqrt{\dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then, the [[scalar product]] of velocity with acceleration in Newton's second law takes the form
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta K = m\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\dot{v}vdt = \frac{m}{2}\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\frac{d}{dt}v^2  dt = \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1), &lt;/math&gt;.
where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity,
:&lt;math&gt; K = \frac{m}{2} v^2 = \frac{m}{2} \dot{\mathbf{X}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{X}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The result is the work–energy principle for particle dynamics,
:&lt;math&gt; W = \Delta K. \!&lt;/math&gt;
This derivation can be generalized to arbitrary rigid body systems.

===Moving in a straight line (skid to a stop)===
Consider the case of a vehicle moving along a straight horizontal trajectory under the action of a driving force and gravity that sum to '''F'''.  The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road define '''R''', and we have
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} + \mathbf{R} =m\ddot{\mathbf{X}}. &lt;/math&gt;
For convenience let the trajectory be along the X-axis, so {{nowrap|1='''X''' = (''d'', 0)}} and the velocity is {{nowrap|1='''V''' = (''v'', 0)}}, then {{nowrap|1='''R''' ⋅ '''V''' = 0}}, and {{nowrap|1='''F''' ⋅ '''V''' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''v''}}, where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of '''F''' along the X-axis, so
:&lt;math&gt; F_x v = m\dot{v}v.&lt;/math&gt;
Integration of both sides yields
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{t_1}^{t_2}F_x v dt =  \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1). &lt;/math&gt;
If F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is constant along the trajectory, then the integral of velocity is distance, so
:&lt;math&gt; F_x (d(t_2)-d(t_1)) =  \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_2) - \frac{m}{2}v^2(t_1). &lt;/math&gt;

As an example consider a car skidding to a stop, where ''k'' is the coefficient of friction and ''W'' is the weight of the car.  Then the force along the trajectory is {{nowrap|1=''F''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = −''kW''}}.  The velocity ''v'' of the car can be determined from the length ''s'' of the skid using the work–energy principle,
:&lt;math&gt;kWs = \frac{W}{2g} v^2,\quad\mbox{or}\quad v = \sqrt{2ksg}.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that this formula uses the fact that the mass of the vehicle is {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''W''/''g''}}.

===Coasting down a mountain road (gravity racing)===
Consider the case of a vehicle that starts at rest and coasts down a mountain road, the work-energy principle helps compute the minimum distance that the vehicle travels to reach a velocity ''V'', of say 60&amp;nbsp;mph (88 fps).  Rolling resistance and air drag will slow the vehicle down so the actual distance will be greater than if these forces are neglected.

Let the trajectory of the vehicle following the road be '''X'''(''t'') which is a curve in three-dimensional space.  The force acting on the vehicle that pushes it down the road is the constant force of gravity {{nowrap|1='''F''' = (0, 0, ''W'')}}, while the force of the road on the vehicle is the constraint force '''R'''.  Newton's second law yields,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} + \mathbf{R} =m\ddot{\mathbf{X}}. &lt;/math&gt;
The [[scalar product]] of this equation with the velocity, {{nowrap|1='''V''' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, yields
:&lt;math&gt; W v_z = m\dot{V}V,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is the magnitude of '''V'''.  The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road cancel from this equation because {{nowrap|1='''R''' ⋅ '''V''' = 0}}, which means they do no work.
Integrate both sides to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{t_1}^{t_2}W v_z dt =  \frac{m}{2}V^2(t_2) - \frac{m}{2}V^2(t_1). &lt;/math&gt;
The weight force ''W'' is constant along the trajectory and the integral of the vertical velocity is the vertical distance, therefore,
:&lt;math&gt; W \Delta z =  \frac{m}{2}V^2. &lt;/math&gt;
Recall that V(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)=0. Notice that this result does not depend on the shape of the road followed by the vehicle.

In order to determine the distance along the road assume the downgrade is 6%, which is a steep road.  This means the altitude decreases 6 feet for every 100 feet traveled—for angles this small the sin and tan functions are approximately equal.  Therefore, the distance ''s'' in feet down a 6% grade to reach the velocity ''V'' is at least
:&lt;math&gt; s=\frac{\Delta z}{0.06}= 8.3\frac{V^2}{g},\quad\mbox{or}\quad s=8.3\frac{88^2}{32.2}\approx 2000\mbox{ft}.&lt;/math&gt;
This formula uses the fact that the weight of the vehicle is {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mg''}}.

==Work of forces acting on a rigid body==
The work of forces acting at various points on a single rigid body can be calculated from the work of a [[resultant force|resultant force and torque]].  To see this, let the forces '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; act on the points '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in a rigid body.

The trajectories of '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''  are defined by the movement of the rigid body.  This movement is given by the set of rotations [''A''(''t'')] and the trajectory '''d'''(''t'') of a reference point in the body.  Let the coordinates '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''  define these points in the moving rigid body's  [[Cartesian coordinate system|reference frame]] ''M'', so that the trajectories traced in the fixed frame ''F'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X}_i(t)= [A(t)]\mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{d}(t)\quad i=1,\ldots, n. &lt;/math&gt;

The velocity of the points '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; along their trajectories  are
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i = \vec{\omega}\times(\mathbf{X}_i-\mathbf{d}) + \dot{\mathbf{d}},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''ω''' is the angular velocity vector obtained from the skew symmetric matrix
:&lt;math&gt; [\Omega] = \dot{A}A^\mathrm{T},&lt;/math&gt;
known as the angular velocity matrix.

The small amount of work by the forces over the small displacements ''δ'''''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be determined by approximating the displacement by {{nowrap|1=''δ'''''r''' = '''v'''''δt''}} so
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = \mathbf{F}_1\cdot\mathbf{V}_1\delta t+\mathbf{F}_2\cdot\mathbf{V}_2\delta t + \ldots + \mathbf{F}_n\cdot\mathbf{V}_n\delta t&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W =  \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F}_i\cdot (\vec{\omega}\times(\mathbf{X}_i-\mathbf{d}) + \dot{\mathbf{d}})\delta t. &lt;/math&gt;

This formula can be rewritten to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W =  (\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F}_i)\cdot\dot{\mathbf{d}}\delta t + (\sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf{X}_i-\mathbf{d})\times\mathbf{F}_i) \cdot \vec{\omega}\delta t = (\mathbf{F}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{d}}+ \mathbf{T}\cdot \vec{\omega})\delta t, &lt;/math&gt;
where '''F''' and '''T''' are the [[resultant force|resultant force and torque]] applied at the reference point '''d''' of the moving frame ''M'' in the rigid body.

In [[physics]], '''mass''' is a property of a [[physical body]] which determines the strength of its mutual [[gravitation]]al attraction to other bodies, its [[Inertia|resistance]] to being [[Acceleration|accelerated]] by [[Net force|a force]], and in the [[theory of relativity]] gives the [[mass–energy]] content of a system. The [[SI unit]] of mass is the [[kilogram]] (kg).

Mass is not the same as [[weight]], even though we often calculate an object's mass by measuring its weight with a [[Weighing scale#Spring scales|spring scale]] instead of [[Weighing scale#Balance scales|comparing it to known masses]]. An object on the Moon would weigh less than it would on Earth because of the lower gravity, but it would still have the same mass.

For everyday objects and energies well-described by [[Newtonian physics]], mass describes the amount of [[matter]] in an object. However, at very high speeds or for subatomic particles, [[special relativity]] shows that [[energy]] is an additional source of mass.  Thus, any stationary body having mass has an [[Mass–energy equivalence|equivalent]] amount of energy, and all [[forms of energy]] resist acceleration by a force and have gravitational attraction.

There are several distinct phenomena which can be used to measure mass.  Although some theorists have speculated some of these phenomena could be independent of each other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/419367/new-quantum-theory-separates-gravitational-and-inertial-mass/ |title=New Quantum Theory Separates Gravitational and Inertial Mass |publisher=MIT Technology Review |date=14 Jun 2010 |accessdate=3 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; current experiments have found no difference among any of the ways used to measure mass:

* ''Inertial mass'' measures an object's resistance to being accelerated by a force (represented by the relationship {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''ma''}}).
* ''Active gravitational mass'' measures the [[gravitational force]] exerted by an object.
* ''Passive gravitational mass'' measures the [[gravitational force]] experienced by an object in a known gravitational field.
* ''Mass–energy'' measures the total amount of [[energy]] contained within a body, using {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The mass of an object determines its [[acceleration]] in the presence of an applied force.  This phenomenon is called [[inertia]]. According to [[Newton's second law of motion]], if a body of fixed mass ''m'' is subjected to a single force ''F'', its acceleration ''a'' is given by ''F''/''m''. A body's mass also determines the degree to which it generates or is affected by a [[gravitational field]]. If a first body of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is placed at a distance ''r'' (center of mass to center of mass) from a second body of mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, each body experiences an attractive force {{nowrap|1=''F''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Gm''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{nowrap|1=''G'' = {{val|6.67|e=-11|u=N kg&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} is the &quot;universal [[gravitational constant]]&quot;. This is sometimes referred to as gravitational mass.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;When a distinction is necessary, ''M'' is used to denote the active gravitational mass and ''m'' the passive gravitational mass.&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated experiments since the 17th century have demonstrated that inertial and gravitational mass are identical; since 1915, this observation has been entailed ''a priori'' in the [[equivalence principle]] of [[general relativity]].

== Units of mass ==
{{further|Orders of magnitude (mass)}}
[[File:SI base unit.svg|thumb|The kilogram is one of the seven [[SI base units]] and one of three which is defined ''ad hoc'' (i.e. without reference to another base unit).]]

The standard [[International System of Units]] (SI) unit of mass is the [[kilogram]] (kg). The kilogram is 1000&amp;nbsp;grams (g), first defined in 1795 as one cubic decimeter of water at the [[melting point]] of ice. Then in 1889, the kilogram was redefined as the mass of the [[international prototype kilogram]], and as such is independent of the meter, or the properties of water. As of January 2013, there are several proposals for redefining the kilogram yet again, including a proposal for defining it in terms of the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23068-most-fundamental-clock-ever-could-redefine-kilogram.html#.UrCAA7SBZmY |title=Most fundamental clock ever could redefine kilogram |publisher=NewScientist |author=Jacob Aron |date=10 Jan 2013 |accessdate=17 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other units are accepted for use in SI:
* the [[tonne]] (t) (or &quot;metric ton&quot;) is equal to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg.
* the [[electronvolt#Mass|electronvolt]] (eV) is a unit of [[energy]], but because of the [[mass–energy equivalence]] it can easily be converted to a unit of mass, and is often used like one. In this context, the mass has units of eV/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The electronvolt is common in [[particle physics]].
* the [[atomic mass unit]] (u) is 1/12 of the mass of a [[carbon-12]] atom, approximately {{val|1.66|e=-27|u=kg}}.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Since the [[Avogadro constant]] ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the number of atoms in 12&amp;nbsp;g of carbon-12, it follows that 1&amp;nbsp;u is exactly 1/(10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;/ref&gt; The atomic mass unit is convenient for expressing the masses of atoms and molecules.

Outside the SI system, other units include:
* the [[Slug (mass)|slug]] (sl) is an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] of mass (about 14.6&amp;nbsp;kg) similar to the kilogram.
* the [[Pound (mass)|pound]] (lb) is a unit of both mass and force, used mainly in the United States (about 0.45&amp;nbsp;kg or 4.5&amp;nbsp;N). In scientific contexts where [[pound (force)]] and [[pound (mass)]] need to be distinguished, SI units are usually used instead.
* the [[Planck mass]] (''m''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) is the maximum mass of point particles (about {{val|2.18|e=-8|u=kg}}). It is used in [[particle physics]].
* the [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass}}) is defined as the mass of the [[sun]]. It is primarily used in astronomy to compare large masses such as stars or galaxies (≈{{val|1.99|e=30|u=kg}}).
* the mass of a very small particle may be identified with its inverse [[Compton wavelength]] ({{nowrap|1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ {{val|3.52|e=-41|u=kg}}}}).
* the mass of a very large star or [[black hole]] may be identified with its [[Schwarzschild radius]] ({{nowrap|1&amp;nbsp;cm ≈ {{val|6.73|e=24|u=kg}}}}).

== Definitions of mass ==
{{Properties of mass}}

In [[physical science]], one may distinguish conceptually between at least seven different aspects of ''mass'', or seven physical notions that involve the concept of ''mass'':&lt;ref name=&quot;Rindler2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=W. Rindler |date=2006 |title=Relativity: Special, General, And Cosmological |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MuuaG5HXOGEC&amp;pg=PA16 |pages=16–18 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-856731-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every experiment to date has shown these seven values to be [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]], and in some cases equal, and this proportionality gives rise to the abstract concept of mass.

* The amount of [[matter]] in certain types of samples can be exactly determined through [[Electrophoretic deposition|electrodeposition]]{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} or other [[kilogram#Atom-counting approaches|precise processes]].  The mass of an exact sample is determined in part by the number and type of atoms or molecules it contains, and in part by the energy involved in binding it together (which contributes a negative &quot;missing mass,&quot; or mass deficit).
* Inertial mass is a measure of an object's resistance to changing its state of motion when a [[force]] is applied.  It is determined by applying a force to an object and measuring the acceleration that results from that force.  An object with small inertial mass will accelerate more than an object with large inertial mass when acted upon by the same force.  One says the body of greater mass has greater [[inertia]].
* Active gravitational mass &lt;ref group=note &gt;The distinction between &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; gravitational mass does not exist in the Newtonian view of gravity as found in [[classical mechanics]], and can safely be ignored by laypersons. In most practical applications, Newtonian gravity is used because it is usually sufficiently accurate, and is simpler than General Relativity; for example, NASA uses primarily Newtonian gravity to design space missions, although &quot;accuracies are routinely enhanced by accounting for tiny relativistic effects&quot;.{{URL|http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf3-2.php}} The distinction between &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; is very abstract, and applies to post-graduate level applications of General Relativity to certain problems in cosmology, and is otherwise not used. There is, nevertheless, an important conceptual distinction in Newtonian physics between &quot;''inertial'' mass&quot; and &quot;gravitational mass&quot;, although these quantities are identical; the conceptual distinction between these two fundamental definitions of mass is maintained for teaching purposes because they involve two distinct methods of measurement. It was long considered anomalous that the two distinct measurements of mass (inertial and gravitational) gave the identical result. The observed property, noted by Galileo, according to which objects of different mass fall with the same rate of acceleration (ignoring air resistance), is an expression of the fact that inertial and gravitational mass are the same.&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of the strength of an object's [[Gauss' law for gravity|gravitational flux]] (gravitational flux is equal to the surface integral of gravitational field over an enclosing surface).  Gravitational field can be measured by allowing a small 'test object' to freely fall and measuring its [[free-fall]] acceleration.  For example, an object in free-fall near the [[Moon]] will experience less gravitational field, and hence accelerate more slowly than the same object would if it were in free-fall near the Earth.  The gravitational field near the Moon is weaker because the Moon has less active gravitational mass.
* Passive gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object's interaction with a [[gravitational field]].  Passive gravitational mass is determined by dividing an object's weight by its free-fall acceleration.  Two objects within the same gravitational field will experience the same acceleration; however, the object with a smaller passive gravitational mass will experience a smaller force (less weight) than the object with a larger passive gravitational mass.
* Energy also has mass according to the principle of [[mass–energy equivalence]].  This equivalence is exemplified in a large number of physical processes including [[pair production]], [[nuclear fusion]], and the gravitational [[gravitational lens|bending of light]].  Pair production and nuclear fusion are processes through which measurable amounts of mass and energy are converted into each other.  In the gravitational bending of light, photons of pure energy are shown to exhibit a behavior similar to passive gravitational mass.
* Curvature of [[spacetime]] is a relativistic manifestation of the existence of mass. [[Curvature]] is extremely weak and difficult to measure.  For this reason, curvature was not discovered until after it was predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity.  Extremely precise [[atomic clocks]] on the surface of the earth, for example, are found to measure less time (run slower) when compared to similar clocks in space.  This difference in elapsed time is a form of curvature called [[gravitational time dilation]].  Other forms of curvature have been measured using the [[Gravity Probe B]] satellite.
* Quantum mass manifests itself as a difference between an object's quantum [[frequency]] and its [[wave number]].  The quantum mass of an electron, the [[Compton wavelength]], can be determined through various forms of [[spectroscopy]] and is closely related to the [[Rydberg constant]], the [[Bohr radius]], and the [[classical electron radius]].  The quantum mass of larger objects can be directly measured using a [[watt balance]].  In relativistic quantum mechanics, mass is one of the irreducible representation labels of the Poincaré group.

===Weight vs. mass===
{{main|Mass versus weight}}
In everyday usage, mass and &quot;[[weight]]&quot; are often used interchangeably. For instance, a person's weight may be stated as 75&amp;nbsp;kg. In a constant gravitational field, the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, and it is unproblematic to use the same unit for both concepts. But because of slight differences in the strength of the [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravitational field]] at different places, the [[Mass versus weight|distinction]] becomes important for measurements with a precision better than a few percent, and for places far from the surface of the Earth, such as in space or on other planets. Conceptually, &quot;mass&quot; (measured in [[kilograms]]) refers to an intrinsic property of an object, whereas &quot;weight&quot; (measured in [[newtons]]) measures an object's resistance to deviating from its natural course of [[free fall]], which can be influenced by the nearby gravitational field. No matter how strong the gravitational field, objects in free fall are [[Weightlessness|weightless]], though they still have mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kane |first=Gordon |title=The Mysteries of Mass |newspaper=Scientific American |location= |pages=32–39 |language= |publisher=Nature America, Inc. |date=September 4, 2008 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-mysteries-of-mass |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The force known as &quot;weight&quot; is proportional to mass and [[acceleration]] in all situations where the mass is accelerated away from free fall. For example, when a body is at rest in a gravitational field (rather than in free fall), it must be accelerated by a force from a scale or the surface of a planetary body such as the [[Earth]] or the [[Moon]]. This force keeps the object from going into free fall. Weight is the opposing force in such circumstances, and is thus determined by the acceleration of free fall. On the surface of the Earth, for example, an object with a mass of 50&amp;nbsp;kilograms weighs 491 newtons, which means that 491 newtons is being applied to keep the object from going into free fall. By contrast, on the surface of the Moon, the same object still has a mass of 50&amp;nbsp;kilograms but weighs only 81.5&amp;nbsp;newtons, because only 81.5 newtons is required to keep this object from going into a free fall on the moon. Restated in mathematical terms, on the surface of the Earth, the weight ''W'' of an object is related to its mass ''m'' by {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''mg''}}, where {{nowrap|1=''g'' = {{val|fmt=commas|9.80665|u=m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} is the acceleration due to [[Earth's gravity|Earth's gravitational field]], (expressed as the acceleration experienced by a free-falling object).

For other situations, such as when objects are subjected to mechanical accelerations from forces other than the resistance of a planetary surface, the weight force is proportional to the mass of an object multiplied by the total acceleration away from free fall, which is called the [[proper acceleration]]. Through such mechanisms, objects in elevators, vehicles, centrifuges, and the like, may experience weight forces many times those caused by resistance to the effects of gravity on objects, resulting from planetary surfaces. In such cases, the generalized equation for weight ''W'' of an object is related to its mass ''m'' by the equation {{nowrap|1=''W'' = –''ma''}}, where ''a'' is the proper acceleration of the object caused by all influences other than gravity. (Again, if gravity is the only influence, such as occurs when an object falls freely, its weight will be zero).

Macroscopically, mass is associated with [[matter]], although matter is not, ultimately, as clearly defined a concept as mass. On the subatomic scale, not only [[fermion]]s, the particles often associated with matter, but also some [[boson]]s, the particles that act as [[force carrier]]s, have [[rest mass]]. Another problem for easy definition is that much of the rest mass of ordinary matter derives from the invariant mass contributed to matter by particles and kinetic energies which have no rest mass themselves (only 1% of the rest mass of matter is accounted for by the rest mass of its fermionic quarks and electrons). From a fundamental physics perspective, mass is the number describing under which the [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]] of the [[little group]] of the [[Poincaré group]] a particle transforms. In the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, this symmetry is described as arising as a consequence of a coupling of particles with rest mass to a postulated additional [[Field (physics)|field]], known as the [[Higgs field]].

The total mass of the [[observable universe]] is estimated at between 10&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg and 10&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg, corresponding to the rest mass of between 10&lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; [[proton]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Inertial vs. gravitational mass===
Although inertial mass, passive gravitational mass and active gravitational mass are conceptually distinct, no experiment has ever unambiguously demonstrated any difference between them. In [[classical mechanics]], Newton's third law implies that active and passive gravitational mass must always be identical (or at least proportional), but the classical theory offers no compelling reason why the gravitational mass has to equal the inertial mass. That it does is merely an empirical fact.

[[Albert Einstein]] developed his [[general theory of relativity]] starting from the assumption that this correspondence between inertial and (passive) gravitational mass is not accidental: that no experiment will ever detect a difference between them (the weak version of the [[equivalence principle]])&lt;!-- because &quot;acceleration&quot; (due to an external force)--&gt;. However, in the resulting theory, gravitation is not a force and thus not subject to Newton's third law, so &quot;the equality of inertial and ''active'' gravitational mass [...] remains as puzzling as ever&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rindler3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rindler |first1=W. |date=2006 |title=Relativity: Special, General, And Cosmological |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MuuaG5HXOGEC&amp;pg=PA22 |page=22 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-856731-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Galilean equivalence principle&quot; or the &quot;[[weak equivalence principle]]&quot;. The most important consequence of this equivalence principle applies to freely falling objects. Suppose we have an object with inertial and gravitational masses ''m'' and ''M'', respectively. If the only force acting on the object comes from a gravitational field ''g'', combining Newton's second law and the gravitational law yields the acceleration

: &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{M}{m}g.&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass of any object is equal to some constant ''K'' [[if and only if]] all objects fall at the same rate in a given gravitational field. This phenomenon is referred to as the &quot;universality of free-fall&quot;. (In addition, the constant ''K'' can be taken to be 1 by defining our units appropriately.)

The first experiments demonstrating the universality of free-fall were conducted by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]. It is commonly stated that Galileo obtained his results by dropping objects from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]], but this is most likely apocryphal; actually, he performed his experiments with balls rolling down nearly frictionless [[inclined plane]]s to slow the motion and increase the timing accuracy. Increasingly precise experiments have been performed, such as those performed by [[Loránd Eötvös]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Eötvös |first1=R. V. |last2=Pekár |first2=D. |last3=Fekete |first3=E. |date=1922 |title=''Beiträge zum Gesetz der Proportionalität von Trägheit und Gravität'' |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |volume=68 |page=11 |bibcode=  1922AnP...373...11E|doi=10.1002/andp.19223730903}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[torsion balance]] pendulum, in 1889. {{As of|2008}}, no deviation from universality, and thus from Galilean equivalence, has ever been found, at least to the precision 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;. More precise experimental efforts are still being carried out.

The universality of free-fall only applies to systems in which gravity is the only acting force. All other forces, especially [[friction]] and [[air resistance]], must be absent or at least negligible. For example, if a hammer and a feather are dropped from the same height through the air on Earth, the feather will take much longer to reach the ground; the feather is not really in ''free''-fall because the force of air resistance upwards against the feather is comparable to the downward force of gravity. On the other hand, if the experiment is performed in a [[vacuum]], in which there is no air resistance, the hammer and the feather should hit the ground at exactly the same time (assuming the acceleration of both objects towards each other, and of the ground towards both objects, for its own part, is negligible). This can easily be done in a high school laboratory by dropping the objects in transparent tubes that have the air removed with a vacuum pump. It is even more dramatic when done in an environment that naturally has a vacuum, as [[David Scott]] did on the surface of the [[Moon]] during [[Apollo 15]].

A stronger version of the equivalence principle, known as the ''Einstein equivalence principle'' or the ''strong equivalence principle'', lies at the heart of the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]]. Einstein's equivalence principle states that within sufficiently small regions of space-time, it is impossible to distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field. Thus, the theory postulates that the force acting on a massive object caused by a gravitational field is a result of the object's tendency to move in a straight line (in other words its inertia) and should therefore be a function of its inertial mass and the strength of the gravitational field.

===Origin of mass===
{{main|Mass generation mechanism}}
In [[theoretical physics]], a [[mass generation mechanism]] is a theory which attempts to explain the origin of mass from the most fundamental laws of [[physics]]. To date, a number of different models have been proposed which advocate different views at the origin of mass. The problem is complicated by the fact that the notion of mass is strongly related to the [[gravitational interaction]] but a theory of the latter has not been yet reconciled with the currently popular model of [[particle physics]], known as the [[Standard Model]].

== Pre-Newtonian concepts ==

===Weight as an amount===
{{main|weight}}
[[File:Weighing of the heart3.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of early [[balance scales]] in the [[Papyrus of Hunefer]] (dated to the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]], ca. 1285 BC). The scene shows [[Anubis]] weighing the heart of Hunefer.]]
The concept of [[wikt:amount|amount]] is very old and [[Prehistoric numerals|predates recorded history]].  Humans, at some early era, realized that the weight of a collection of similar objects was [[Proportionality (mathematics)|directly proportional]] to the number of objects in the collection:

: &lt;math&gt;W_n \propto n,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the weight of the collection of similar objects and ''n'' is the number of objects in the collection. Proportionality, by definition, implies that two values have a constant [[ratio]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{W_n}{n} = \frac{W_m}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently &lt;math&gt;\frac{W_n}{W_m} = \frac{n}{m}.&lt;/math&gt;

An early use of this relationship is a [[balance scale]], which balances the force of one object's weight against the force of another object's weight. The two sides of a balance scale are close enough that the objects experience similar gravitational fields.  Hence, if they have similar masses then their weights will also be similar.  This allows the scale, by comparing weights, to also compare masses.

Consequently, historical weight standards were often defined in terms of amounts.  The Romans, for example, used the [[carob]] seed ([[Carat (unit)|carat]] or [[siliqua]]) as a measurement standard.  If an object's weight was equivalent to [http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n3138.pdf 1728 carob seeds], then the object was said to weigh one Roman pound.  If, on the other hand, the object's weight was equivalent to [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|144 carob seeds]] then the object was said to weigh one Roman ounce (uncia).  The Roman pound and ounce were both defined in terms of different sized collections of the same common mass standard, the carob seed.  The ratio of a Roman ounce (144 carob seeds) to a Roman pound (1728 carob seeds) was:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{ounce}}{\mathrm{pound}} = \frac{W_{144}}{W_{1728}} = \frac{144}{1728} = \frac{1}{12}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Planetary motion===
{{see also|Kepler's laws of planetary motion}}
In 1600 AD, [[Johannes Kepler]] sought employment with [[Tycho Brahe]], who had some of the most precise astronomical data available.  Using Brahe's precise observations of the planet Mars, Kepler spent the next five years developing his own method for characterizing planetary motion. In 1609, Johannes Kepler published his three laws of planetary motion, explaining how the planets orbit the Sun. In Kepler's final planetary model, he described planetary orbits as following [[elliptical]] paths with the Sun at a focal point of the ellipse. Kepler discovered that the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[orbital period]] of each planet is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[cube (arithmetic)|cube]] of the [[semi-major axis]] of its orbit, or equivalently, that the [[ratio]] of these two values is constant for all planets in the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;This constant ratio was later shown to be a direct measure of the Sun's active gravitational mass; it has units of distance cubed per time squared, and is known as the [[standard gravitational parameter]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\mu=4\pi^2\frac{\text{distance}^3}{\text{time}^2}\propto\text{gravitational mass}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 August 1609, [[Galileo Galilei]] demonstrated his first telescope to a group of Venetian merchants, and in early January of 1610, Galileo observed four dim objects near Jupiter, which he mistook for stars.  However, after a few days of observation, Galileo realized that these &quot;stars&quot; were in fact orbiting Jupiter.  These four objects (later named the [[Galilean moons]] in honor of their discoverer) were the first celestial bodies observed to orbit something other than the Earth or Sun.  Galileo continued to observe these moons over the next eighteen months, and by the middle of 1611 he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods.

===Galilean free fall===
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Galileo Galilei (1636)]]
[[File:Falling ball.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Distance traveled by a freely falling ball is proportional to the square of the elapsed time]]
Sometime prior to 1638, Galileo turned his attention to the phenomenon of objects in free fall, attempting to characterize these motions. Galileo was not the first to investigate Earth's gravitational field, nor was he the first to accurately describe its fundamental characteristics.  However, Galileo's reliance on scientific experimentation to establish physical principles would have a profound effect on future generations of scientists. It is unclear if these were just hypothetical experiments used to illustrate a concept, or if they were real experiments performed by Galileo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drake |first=S. |date=1979 |title=Galileo's Discovery of the Law of Free Fall |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=228 |issue=5 |pages=84–92 |bibcode=1973SciAm.228e..84D |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0573-84}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the results obtained from these experiments were both realistic and compelling.  A biography by Galileo's pupil [[Vincenzo Viviani]] stated that Galileo had dropped [[ball]]s of the same material, but different masses, from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;At the time when Viviani asserts that the experiment took place, Galileo had not yet formulated the final version of his law of free fall. He had, however, formulated an earlier version which predicted that bodies ''of the same material'' falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed. See {{cite book |last=Drake |first=S. |date=1978 |title=Galileo at Work |pages=19–20 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=0-226-16226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this conclusion, Galileo had advanced the following theoretical argument: He asked if two bodies of different masses and different rates of fall are tied by a string, does the combined system fall faster because it is now more massive, or does the lighter body in its slower fall hold back the heavier body?  The only convincing resolution to this question is that all bodies must fall at the same rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galileo |first=G. |date=1632 |title=[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later experiment was described in Galileo's ''Two New Sciences'' published in 1638.  One of Galileo's fictional characters, Salviati, describes an experiment using a bronze ball and a wooden ramp.  The wooden ramp was &quot;12 cubits long, half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick&quot; with a straight, smooth, polished [[Groove (engineering)|groove]].  The groove was lined with &quot;[[parchment]], also smooth and polished as possible&quot;.  And into this groove was placed &quot;a hard, smooth and very round bronze ball&quot;.  The ramp was inclined at various [[angle]]s to slow the acceleration enough so that the elapsed time could be measured.  The ball was allowed to roll a known distance down the ramp, and the time taken for the ball to move the known distance was measured.  The time was measured using a water clock described as follows:
:&quot;a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water, which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length; the water thus collected was weighed, after each descent, on a very accurate balance; the differences and ratios of these weights gave us the differences and ratios of the times, and this with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Galileo |first1=G. |date=1638 |title=Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, Intorno à Due Nuove Scienze |volume=213 |publisher=[[House of Elzevir|Louis Elsevier]]}}, translated in {{cite book |date=1954 |editor1-last=Crew |editor1-first=H. |editor2-last=de Salvio |editor2-first=A. |title=Mathematical Discourses and Demonstrations, Relating to Two New Sciences |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;Itemid=99999999 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=1-275-10057-0}} and also available in {{cite book |editor1-last=Hawking |editor1-first=S. |date=2002 |title=On the Shoulders of Giants |pages=534–535 |publisher=[[Running Press]] |isbn=0-7624-1348-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo found that for an object in free fall, the distance that the object has fallen is always proportional to the square of the elapsed time:

: &lt;math&gt;{\text{Distance}} \propto {\text{Time}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Galileo had shown that objects in free fall under the influence of the Earth’s gravitational field have a constant acceleration, and Galileo’s contemporary, Johannes Kepler, had shown that the planets follow elliptical paths under the influence of the Sun’s gravitational mass.  However, Galileo’s free fall motions and Kepler’s planetary motions remained distinct during Galileo’s lifetime.

[[Robert Hooke]] had published his concept of gravitational forces in 1674, stating that all [[celestial bodies]] have an attraction or gravitating power towards their own centers, and also attract all the other celestial bodies that are within the sphere of their activity. He further stated that gravitational attraction increases by how much nearer the body wrought upon is to their own center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hooke |first=R. |date=1674 |title=An attempt to prove the motion of the earth from observations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgtPAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |publisher=[[Royal Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In correspondence with Isaac Newton from 1679 and 1680, Hooke conjectures that gravitational forces might decrease according to the double of the distance between the two bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Turnbull |editor-first=H. W. |date=1960 |title=Correspondence of Isaac Newton, Volume 2 (1676–1687) |page=297 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke urged Newton, who was a pioneer in the development of [[calculus]], to work through the mathematical details of Keplerian orbits to determine if Hooke's hypothesis was correct.  Newton's own investigations verified that Hooke was correct, but due to personal differences between the two men, Newton chose not to reveal this to Hooke.  Isaac Newton kept quiet about his discoveries until 1684, at which time he told a friend, [[Edmond Halley]], that he had solved the problem of gravitational orbits, but had misplaced the solution in his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Hawking |editor-first=S. |date=2005 |title=Principia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mlLAG5EUZqQC&amp;pg=PR15 |pages=15''ff'' |publisher=[[Running Press]] |isbn=978-0-7624-2022-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being encouraged by Halley, Newton decided to develop his ideas about gravity and publish all of his findings.  In November 1684, Isaac Newton sent a document to Edmund Halley, now lost but presumed to have been titled ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'' (Latin for &quot;On the motion of bodies in an orbit&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |editor-last=Whiteside |editor-first=D.

Newton later recorded his ideas in a three book set, entitled [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (Latin: &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;).  The first was received by the Royal Society on 28 April 1685–6; the second on 2 March 1686–7; and the third on 6 April 1686–7.  The Royal Society published Newton’s entire collection at their own expense in May 1686–7.&lt;ref name=&quot;principia&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sir Isaac Newton |author2=N. W.

Adee}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}}

Isaac Newton had bridged the gap between Kepler’s gravitational mass and Galileo’s gravitational acceleration, resulting in the discovery of the following relationship which governed both of these:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}=-\mu\frac{\hat{\mathbf{R}}}{|\mathbf{R}|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''g''' is the apparent acceleration of a body as it passes through a region of space where gravitational fields exist, ''μ'' is the gravitational mass ([[standard gravitational parameter]]) of the body causing gravitational fields, and '''R''' is the radial coordinate (the distance between the centers of the two bodies).

By finding the exact relationship between a body's gravitational mass and its gravitational field, Newton provided a second method for measuring gravitational mass.  The mass of the Earth can be determined using Kepler's method (from the orbit of Earth's Moon), or it can be determined by measuring the gravitational acceleration on the Earth's surface, and multiplying that by the square of the Earth's radius.  The mass of the Earth is approximately three millionths of the mass of the Sun.  To date, no other accurate method for measuring gravitational mass has been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cuk |first=M. |date=January 2003 |title=Curious About Astronomy: How do you measure a planet's mass? |url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=452 |work=Ask an Astronomer |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton's cannonball===
[[File:Newton Cannon.svg|thumb|A cannon on top of a very high mountain shoots a cannonball horizontally.  If the speed is low, the cannonball quickly falls back to Earth (A,B). At [[orbital speed|intermediate speeds]], it will revolve around Earth along an elliptical orbit (C,D). At [[Escape velocity|a sufficiently high speed]], it will leave the Earth altogether (E).]]
{{main|Newton's cannonball}}

Newton's cannonball was a [[thought experiment]] used to bridge the gap between Galileo's gravitational acceleration and Kepler's elliptical orbits.  It appeared in Newton's 1728 book ''A Treatise of the System of the World''.  According to Galileo's concept of gravitation, a dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the Earth.  However, Newton explains that when a stone is thrown horizontally (meaning sideways or perpendicular to Earth's gravity) it follows a curved path.  &quot;For a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path, which by the projection alone it should have pursued, and made to describe a curve line in the air; and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground.  And the greater the velocity is with which it is projected, the farther it goes before it falls to the Earth.&quot;&lt;ref name=principia /&gt;{{rp|513}} Newton further reasons that if an object were &quot;projected in an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain&quot; with sufficient velocity, &quot;it would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the Earth, and return to the mountain from which it was projected.&quot;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Universal gravitational mass===
[[File:Universal gravitational mass.PNG|An apple experiences gravitational fields directed towards every part of the Earth; however, the sum total of these many fields produces a single gravitational field directed towards the Earth's center|left|thumb]]
In contrast to earlier theories (e.g. [[celestial spheres]]) which stated that the heavens were made of entirely different material, Newton's theory of mass was groundbreaking partly because it introduced [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitational mass]]: every object has gravitational mass, and therefore, every object generates a gravitational field.  Newton further assumed that the strength of each object's gravitational field would decrease according to the square of the distance to that object. If a large collection of small objects were formed into a giant spherical body such as the Earth or Sun, Newton calculated the collection would create a gravitational field proportional to the total mass of the body,&lt;ref name=&quot;principia&quot;/&gt;{{rp|397}} and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the body's center.&lt;ref name=&quot;principia&quot;/&gt;{{rp|221}}&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;These two properties are very useful, as they allow spherical collections of objects to be treated exactly like large individual objects.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, according to Newton's theory of universal gravitation, each carob seed produces a gravitational field.  Therefore, if one were to gather an immense number of carob seeds and form them into an enormous sphere, then the gravitational field of the sphere would be proportional to the number of carob seeds in the sphere.  Hence, it should be theoretically possible to determine the exact number of carob seeds that would be required to produce a gravitational field similar to that of the Earth or Sun.  In fact, by [[unit conversion]] it is a simple matter of abstraction to realize that any traditional mass unit can theoretically be used to measure gravitational mass.

[[File:Cavendish Experiment.png|thumb|right|Vertical section drawing of Cavendish's torsion balance instrument including the building in which it was housed. The large balls were hung from a frame so they could be rotated into position next to the small balls by a pulley from outside. Figure 1 of Cavendish's paper.]]

Measuring gravitational mass in terms of traditional mass units is simple in principle, but extremely difficult in practice.  According to Newton's theory all objects produce gravitational fields and it is theoretically possible to collect an immense number of small objects and form them into an enormous gravitating sphere.  However, from a practical standpoint, the gravitational fields of small objects are extremely weak and difficult to measure. Newton's books on universal gravitation were published in the 1680s, but the first successful measurement of the Earth's mass in terms of traditional mass units, the [[Cavendish experiment]], did not occur until 1797, over a hundred years later. Cavendish found that the Earth's density was 5.448 ± 0.033 times that of water.  As of 2009, the Earth's mass in kilograms is only known to around five digits of accuracy, whereas its gravitational mass is known to over nine significant figures.{{clarify|reason=&quot;mass in kilograms&quot; does not specify an experimental method. What's the distinction between the methods?|date=January 2014}}

Given two objects A and B, of masses ''M''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, separated by a [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;, Newton's law of gravitation states that each object exerts a gravitational force on the other, of magnitude
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{\text{AB}}=-GM_{\text{A}}M_{\text{B}}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{R}}_{\text{AB}}}{|\mathbf{R}_{\text{AB}}|^2}\ &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''G'' is the universal [[gravitational constant]]. The above statement may be reformulated in the following way: if ''g'' is the magnitude at a given location in a gravitational field, then the gravitational force on an object with gravitational mass ''M'' is
: &lt;math&gt;F=Mg&lt;/math&gt;.
This is the basis by which masses are determined by [[weighing]]. In simple [[spring scales]], for example, the force ''F'' is proportional to the displacement of the [[spring (device)|spring]] beneath the weighing pan, as per [[Hooke's law]], and the scales are [[calibration|calibrated]] to take ''g'' into account, allowing the mass ''M'' to be read off. Assuming the gravitational field is equivalent on both sides of the balance, a [[Beam balance|balance]] measures relative weight, giving the relative gravitation mass of each object.

===Inertial mass===
[[File:Massmeter.jpg|thumb|Massmeter, a device for measuring the inertial mass of an astronaut in weightlessness. The mass is calculated via the oscillation period for a spring with the astronaut attached ([[Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics]])]]
''Inertial mass'' is the mass of an object measured by its resistance to acceleration. The simple [[classical mechanics]] definition of mass is slightly different than the definition in the theory of [[special relativity]], but the essential meaning is the same.

In classical mechanics, according to [[Newton's second law]], we say that a body has a mass ''m'' if, at any instant of time, it obeys the equation of motion

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m \mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''F''' is the resultant [[force]] acting on the body and '''a''' is the [[acceleration]] of the body's centre of mass.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;In its original form, Newton's second law is valid only for bodies of constant mass.&lt;/ref&gt; For the moment, we will put aside the question of what &quot;force acting on the body&quot; actually means.

This equation illustrates how mass relates to the [[inertia]] of a body. Consider two objects with different masses. If we apply an identical force to each, the object with a bigger mass will experience a smaller acceleration, and the object with a smaller mass will experience a bigger acceleration. We might say that the larger mass exerts a greater &quot;resistance&quot; to changing its state of motion in response to the force.

However, this notion of applying &quot;identical&quot; forces to different objects brings us back to the fact that we have not really defined what a force is. We can sidestep this difficulty with the help of [[Newton's third law]], which states that if one object exerts a force on a second object, it will experience an equal and opposite force. To be precise, suppose we have two objects of constant inertial masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We isolate the two objects from all other physical influences, so that the only forces present are the force exerted on ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which we denote '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, and the force exerted on ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which we denote '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;. Newton's second law states that
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{F_{12}} &amp; =m_1\mathbf{a}_1,\\
\mathbf{F_{21}} &amp; =m_2\mathbf{a}_2,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the accelerations of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Suppose that these accelerations are non-zero, so that the forces between the two objects are non-zero. This occurs, for example, if the two objects are in the process of colliding with one another. Newton's third law then states that
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{12}=-\mathbf{F}_{21};&lt;/math&gt;
and thus
: &lt;math&gt;m_1=m_2\frac{|\mathbf{a}_2|}{|\mathbf{a}_1|}\!.&lt;/math&gt;

If |'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| is non-zero, the fraction is well-defined, which allows us to measure the inertial mass of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is our &quot;reference&quot; object, and we can define its mass ''m'' as (say) 1&amp;nbsp;kilogram. Then we can measure the mass of any other object in the universe by colliding it with the reference object and measuring the accelerations.

Additionally, mass relates a body's [[momentum]] '''p''' to its linear [[velocity]] '''v''':
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;,
and the body's [[kinetic energy]] ''K'' to its velocity:
: &lt;math&gt;K=\dfrac{1}{2}m|\mathbf{v}|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Atomic mass ==
{{main|Atomic mass unit}}

Typically, the mass of objects is measured in relation to that of the kilogram, which is defined as the mass of the [[Kilogram#International prototype kilogram|''international prototype kilogram'']] (IPK), a platinum alloy cylinder stored in an environmentally-monitored safe secured in a vault at the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] in France. However, the IPK is not convenient for measuring the masses of atoms and particles of similar scale, as it contains trillions of trillions of atoms, and has most certainly lost or gained a little mass over time despite the best efforts to prevent this. It is much easier to precisely compare an atom's mass to that of another atom, thus scientists developed the [[atomic mass unit]]. By definition, 1&amp;nbsp;u is exactly one twelfth of the mass of a [[carbon-12]] atom, and by extension a carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12&amp;nbsp;u.

== Mass in relativity ==

===Special relativity===
{{main|Mass in special relativity}}
In [[special relativity]], there are two kinds of mass: [[rest mass]] (invariant mass),&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;It is possible to make a slight distinction between &quot;rest mass&quot; and &quot;invariant mass&quot;. For a system of two or more particles, none of the particles are required be at rest with respect to the observer for the system as a whole to be at rest with respect to the observer. To avoid this confusion, some sources will use &quot;rest mass&quot; only for individual particles, and &quot;invariant mass&quot; for systems.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[relativistic mass]] (which increases with velocity). Rest mass is the Newtonian mass as measured by an observer moving along with the object.  ''Relativistic mass'' is the total quantity of energy in a body or system divided by [[speed of light|''c'']]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The two are related by the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{relative}=\gamma (m_\mathrm{rest})\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lorentz factor]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The invariant mass of systems is the same for observers in all inertial frames, while the relativistic mass depends on the observer's [[frame of reference]]. In order to formulate the equations of physics such that mass values do not change between observers, it is convenient to use rest mass. The rest mass of a body is also related to its energy ''E'' and the magnitude of its momentum '''p''' by the [[relativistic energy-momentum equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;(m_\mathrm{rest})c^2=\sqrt{E_\mathrm{total}^2-(|\mathbf{p}|c)^2}.\!&lt;/math&gt;

So long as the system is [[Closed system|closed]] with respect to mass and energy, both kinds of mass are conserved in any given frame of reference. The conservation of mass holds even as some types of particles are converted to others. Particles of matter may be converted to types of energy &lt;!--which are not matter --&gt;(e.g. light, kinetic energy, the potential energy in magnetic, electric and other fields) but this does not affect the amount of mass. Although things like heat may not be matter, all types of energy still continue to exhibit mass.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;For example, a nuclear bomb in an idealized super-strong box, sitting on a scale, would in theory show no change in mass when detonated (although the inside of the box would become much hotter). In such a system, the mass of the box would change only if energy were allowed to escape from the box as light or heat. However, in that case, the removed energy would take its associated mass with it. Letting heat out of such a system is simply a way to remove mass. Thus, mass, like energy, cannot be destroyed, but only moved from one place to another.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=E. F. |last2=Wheeler |first2=J. A. |date=1992 |title=Spacetime Physics |pages=248–149 |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman]] |isbn=0-7167-2327-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, mass and energy do not change into one another in relativity; rather, both are names for the same thing, and neither mass nor energy ''appear'' without the other.

Both rest and relativistic mass can be expressed as an energy by applying the well-known relationship [[Mass–energy equivalence|''E''&amp;nbsp;= ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], yielding [[rest energy]] and &quot;relativistic energy&quot; (total system energy) respectively:

: &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{rest}=(m_\mathrm{rest})c^2\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; E_\mathrm{total}=(m_\mathrm{relative})c^2\!&lt;/math&gt;

The &quot;relativistic&quot; mass and energy concepts are related to their &quot;rest&quot; counterparts, but they do not have the same value as their rest counterparts in systems where there is a net momentum. Because the relativistic mass is [[Mass–energy equivalence|proportional to the energy]], it has gradually fallen into disuse among physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author=G. Oas |date=2005 |title=On the Abuse and Use of Relativistic Mass |class=physics.ed-ph |eprint=physics/0504110}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is disagreement over whether the concept remains useful [[Pedagogy|pedagogically]].&lt;ref name=&quot;okun&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Okun |first=L.

In bound systems, the [[binding energy]] must often be subtracted from the mass of the unbound system, because binding energy commonly leaves the system at the time it is bound. Mass is not conserved in this process because the system is not closed during the binding process. For example, the binding energy of [[atomic nuclei]] is often lost in the form of gamma rays when the nuclei are formed, leaving [[nuclide]]s which have less mass than the free particles ([[nucleon]]s) of which they are composed.

===General relativity===
{{main|Mass in general relativity}}
In [[general relativity]], the [[equivalence principle]] is any of several related concepts dealing with the equivalence of [[Gravitational mass|gravitational]] and [[inertial mass]]. At the core of this assertion is [[Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] idea that the gravitational force as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the ''[[Fictitious force|pseudo-force]]'' experienced by an observer in a non-[[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] (i.e. accelerated) frame of reference.

However, it turns out that it is impossible to find an objective general definition for the concept of [[invariant mass]] in general relativity. At the core of the problem is the [[Nonlinear system|non-linearity]] of the [[Einstein field equations]], making it impossible to write the gravitational field energy as part of the [[stress–energy tensor]] in a way that is invariant for all observers. For a given observer, this can be achieved by the [[stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Misner |first1=C. W. |last2=Thorne |first2=K. S. |last3=Wheeler |first3=J. A. |title=Gravitation |date=1973 |page=466 |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman]] |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mass in quantum physics ==

In [[classical mechanics]], the inert mass of a particle appears in the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] as a parameter ''m'':
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \ \left( \, \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i} \, \right) \ = \ m \, \ddot{x}_i &lt;/math&gt;.

After quantization, replacing the position vector ''x'' with a [[wave function]], the parameter ''m'' appears in the [[kinetic energy]] operator:
: &lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) =  \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})\right)\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the ostensibly [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors#Informal usage|covariant]] (relativistically invariant) [[Dirac equation]], and in [[natural units]], this becomes:
: &lt;math&gt;(-i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu + m) \psi = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
...where the &quot;[[Invariant mass|mass]]&quot; parameter ''m'' is now simply a constant associated with the [[quantum]] described by the wave function ψ.

In the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] as developed in the 1960s, there is the proposal that this term arises from the coupling of the field  ψ to an additional field Φ, the so-called [[Higgs field]]. In the case of fermions, the [[Higgs mechanism]] results in the replacement of the term ''m''ψ in the Lagrangian with &lt;math&gt;G_{\psi} \overline{\psi} \phi \psi&lt;/math&gt;. This shifts the [[explanandum]] of the value for the mass of each elementary particle to the value of the unknown couplings ''G''&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;.
The tentatively confirmed discovery of a massive [[Higgs boson]] is regarded as a strong confirmation of this theory. But there is indirect evidence for the reality of the [[Electroweak symmetry breaking]] as described by the Higgs mechanism, and the non-existence of Higgs bosons would indicate a &quot;[[Higgsless model|Higgsless]]&quot; description of this mechanism.

=== Tachyonic particles and imaginary (complex) mass ===
{{main|Tachyonic field|Tachyon#Mass}}

A [[tachyonic field]], or simply [[tachyon]], is a [[quantum field]] with an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] mass.&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt; Although [[tachyon]]s ([[particle]]s that move [[faster-than-light|faster than light]]) are a purely hypothetical concept not generally believed to exist,&lt;ref name=Randall&gt;Lisa Randall, ''Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions'', p.286: &quot;People initially thought of tachyons as particles travelling faster than the speed of light...But we now know that a tachyon indicates an instability in a theory that contains it.  Regrettably for science fiction fans, tachyons are not real physical particles that appear in nature.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;[[tachyon]]&quot; was coined by [[Gerald Feinberg]] in a 1967 paper,&lt;ref name=&quot;feinberg67&quot;/&gt; but it was soon realized that Feinberg's model in fact did not allow for [[superluminal]] speeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;susskind&quot;/&gt; Instead, the imaginary mass creates an instability in the configuration:- any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic will spontaneously decay, and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons.  This process is known as tachyon condensation.  Well known examples include the [[Higgs mechanism|condensation]] of the [[Higgs boson]] in [[particle physics]], and [[ferromagnetism]] in [[condensed matter physics]].

Although the notion of a tachyonic [[imaginary number|imaginary]] mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass, the mass is not quantized.  Rather, the [[scalar field]] is; even for tachyonic [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]], the [[field operator]]s at [[Minkowski space|spacelike]] separated points still [[Canonical commutation relation|commute (or anticommute)]], thus preserving causality. Therefore, information still does not propagate faster than light,&lt;ref name=&quot;feinberg67&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first = Gerald | last = Feinberg | authorlink = Gerald Feinberg | title = Possibility of Faster-Than-Light Particles | journal = Physical Review | volume = 159 | year = 1967 | pages = 1089–1105 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.159.1089|bibcode = 1967PhRv..159.1089F | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and solutions grow exponentially, but not superluminally (there is no violation of [[causality]]). [[Tachyon condensation]] drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons, to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist. Once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential, its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared.&lt;ref name = &quot;Peskin&quot; /&gt;

This is a special case of the general rule, where unstable massive particles are formally described as having a [[complex number|complex]] mass, with the real part being their mass in usual sense, and the imaginary part being the [[Particle decay#Decay rate|decay rate]] in [[natural units]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peskin&quot;&gt;
{{cite book

 |date=1995
 |title=An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory
 |publisher=[[Perseus Books]]
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[quantum field theory]], a particle (a &quot;one-particle state&quot;) is roughly defined as a state which is constant over time; i.e., an [[eigenvalue]] of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. An [[Particle decay|unstable particle]] is a state which is only approximately constant over time; If it exists long enough to be measured, it can be formally described as having a complex mass, with the real part of the mass greater than its imaginary part. If both parts are of the same magnitude, this is interpreted as a [[resonance]] appearing in a scattering process rather than particle, as it is considered not to exist long enough to be measured independently of the scattering process. In the case of a tachyon the real part of the mass is zero, and hence no concept of a particle can be attributed to it.

In a [[Lorentz invariant]] theory, the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower-than-light particles (sometimes called &quot;[[bradyon]]s&quot; in discussions of tachyons) must also apply to tachyons. In particular the [[energy–momentum relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4 \;&lt;/math&gt;
(where '''p''' is the relativistic [[momentum]] of the bradyon and '''m''' is its [[rest mass]]) should still apply, along with the formula for the total energy of a particle:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.&lt;/math&gt;
This equation shows that the total energy of a particle (bradyon or tachyon) contains a contribution from its rest mass (the &quot;rest mass–energy&quot;) and a contribution from its motion, the kinetic energy.
When ''v'' is larger than ''c'', the denominator in the equation for the energy is [[imaginary number|&quot;imaginary&quot;]], as the value under the [[square root|radical]] is negative. Because the total [[energy]] must be [[real number|real]], the numerator must ''also'' be imaginary:  i.e. the [[rest mass]] '''m''' must be imaginary, as a pure imaginary number divided by another pure imaginary number is a real number.

{{Sound measurements}}

The '''speed of sound''' is the distance travelled per unit time by a [[sound wave]] propagating through an [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic]] medium. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of speed is the metre per second (m/s). In dry [[air]] at {{nobreak|20 °C}}, the speed of sound is {{Convert|343.2|m/s|ft/s|0|sp=en}}. This is {{Convert|1236|km/h|mph kn|0|sp=en}}, or a kilometre in {{nobreak|2.914 s}} or a mile in {{nobreak|4.689 s}}. 

The speed of sound in an [[ideal gas]] is independent of frequency, but does vary slightly with frequency in a real gas. It is proportional to the square root of the [[absolute temperature]], but is independent of [[pressure]] or [[density]] for a given ideal gas. The speed of sound in air varies slightly with pressure only because air is not quite an ideal gas. Although (in the case of gases only) the speed of sound is expressed in terms of a ratio of ''both'' density and pressure, these quantities cancel in ideal gases at any given temperature, composition, and heat capacity. This leads to a velocity formula for ideal gases which includes only the latter independent variables.

In common everyday speech, ''speed of sound'' refers to the speed of sound waves in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance. Sound travels faster in [[liquids]] and non-porous [[solids]] than it does in air. It travels about 4.3 times as fast in [[water]] ({{nobreak|1,484 m/s}}), and nearly 15 times as fast in iron ({{nobreak|5,120 m/s}}), as in air at {{nobreak|20 °C}}. Sound waves in solids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), but there is also a different type of sound wave called a [[shear wave]], which occurs only in solids. These different types of waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in [[seismology]]. The speed of a compression sound wave in solids is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]], [[shear modulus]] and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density.

In [[fluid dynamics]], the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium. The speed of an object divided by the speed of sound in the fluid is called the [[Mach number]]. Objects moving at speeds greater than ''{{gaps|Mach|1}}'' are travelling at [[supersonic]] speeds.

==History==
[[Sir Isaac Newton]] computed the speed of sound in air as {{Convert|979|ft/s|m/s|0|sp=n}}, which is too low by about 15%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had neglected the effect of fluctuating temperature; that was later rectified by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, there were several attempts to measure the speed of sound accurately, including attempts by [[Marin Mersenne]] in 1630 (1,380 Parisian feet per second), [[Pierre Gassendi]] in 1635 (1,473 Parisian feet per second) and [[Robert Boyle]] (1,125 Parisian feet per second).&lt;ref name=meridian/&gt;

In 1709, the Reverend [[William Derham]], [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of Upminster, published a more accurate measure of the speed of sound, at 1,072 [[Paris inch|Parisian feet]] per second.&lt;ref name=meridian&gt;{{cite book

==Basic concept==
The transmission of sound can be illustrated by using a model consisting of an array of balls interconnected by springs. For real material
the balls represent molecules and the springs represent the bonds between them. Sound passes through the model by compressing and expanding the springs, transmitting energy to neighbouring balls, which transmit energy to ''their'' springs, and so on. The speed of sound through the model depends on the stiffness of the springs (stiffer springs transmit energy more quickly). Effects like dispersion and reflection can also be understood using this model.

In a real material, the stiffness of the springs is called the [[elastic modulus]], and the mass corresponds to the [[density]]. All other things being equal ([[ceteris paribus]]), sound will travel more slowly in spongy materials, and faster in stiffer ones. For instance, sound will travel 1.59 times faster in nickel than in bronze, due to the greater stiffness of nickel at about the same density. Similarly, sound travels about 1.41 times faster in light hydrogen ([[Hydrogen-1|protium]]) gas than in heavy hydrogen ([[deuterium]]) gas, since deuterium has similar properties but twice the density. At the same time, &quot;compression-type&quot; sound will travel faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases, because the solids are more difficult to compress than liquids, while liquids in turn are more difficult to compress than gases.

Some textbooks mistakenly state that the speed of sound increases with increasing density. This is usually illustrated by presenting data for three materials, such as air, water and steel, which also have vastly different compressibilities which more than make up for the density differences. An illustrative example of the two effects is that sound travels only 4.3 times faster in water than air, despite enormous differences in compressibility of the two media. The reason is that the larger density of water, which works to ''slow'' sound in water relative to air, nearly makes up for the compressibility differences in the two media.

===Compression and shear waves===
[[File:Onde compression impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|Pressure-pulse or compression-type wave ([[longitudinal wave]]) confined to a plane. This is the only type of sound wave that travels in fluids (gases and liquids)]]
[[File:Onde cisaillement impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|[[Transverse wave]] affecting atoms initially confined to a plane. This additional type of sound wave (additional type of elastic wave) travels only in solids, and the sideways shearing motion may take place in '''any''' direction at right angles to the direction of wave-travel (only one shear direction is shown here, at right angles to the plane). Furthermore, the right-angle shear direction may change over time and distance, resulting in different types of polarization of shear-waves]]

In a gas or liquid, sound consists of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A [[longitudinal wave]] is associated with compression and decompression in the direction of travel, which is the same process as all sound waves in gases and liquids. A [[transverse wave]], called a [[shear wave]] in solids, is due to elastic deformation of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the &quot;[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]&quot; of this type of wave. In general, transverse waves occur as a pair of [[orthogonal]] polarizations. These different waves (compression waves and the different polarizations of shear waves) may have different speeds at the same frequency. Therefore, they arrive at an observer at different times, an extreme example being an [[earthquake]], where sharp compression waves arrive first, and rocking transverse waves seconds later.

The speed of a compression wave in fluid is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]] and [[density]]. In solids, the compression waves are analogous to those in fluids, depending on compressibility, density, and the additional factor of [[shear modulus]]. The speed of shear waves, which can occur only in solids, is determined simply by the solid material's shear modulus and density.

==Equations==
In general, the speed of sound ''c'' is given by the Newton–Laplace equation:
: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{\frac{K_s}{\rho}},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a coefficient of stiffness, the isentropic [[bulk modulus]] (or the modulus of bulk elasticity for gases);
* ''ρ'' is the [[density]].

Thus the speed of sound increases with the stiffness (the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an applied force) of the material, and decreases with the density. For ideal gases the bulk modulus ''K'' is simply the gas pressure multiplied by the dimensionless [[adiabatic index]], which is about 1.4 for air under normal conditions of pressure and temperature.

For general [[equations of state]], if [[classical mechanics]] is used, the speed of sound ''c'' is given by
: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial\rho}\right)_s},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''p'' is the pressure;
* ''ρ'' is the density and the [[derivative]] is taken isentropically, that is, at constant [[entropy]] ''s''.

If [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects are important, the speed of sound is calculated from the [[relativistic Euler equations]].

In a [[Acoustic_dispersion|non-dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is independent of [[sound frequency]], so the speeds of energy transport and sound propagation are the same for all frequencies. Air, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, constitutes a non-dispersive medium. However, air does contain a small amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which ''is'' a dispersive medium, and causes dispersion to air at [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequencies ({{nobreak|&gt; 28 [[kHz]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;Dean, E. A. (August 1979). [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA076060 Atmospheric Effects on the Speed of Sound], Technical report of Defense Technical Information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Acoustic_dispersion|dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is a function of sound frequency, through the [[dispersion relation]]. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the [[phase velocity]], while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the [[group velocity]]. The same phenomenon occurs with light waves; see [[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|optical dispersion]] for a description.

==Dependence on the properties of the medium==
The speed of sound is variable and depends on the properties of the substance through which the wave is travelling. In solids, the speed of transverse (or shear) waves depends on the shear deformation under shear stress (called the [[shear modulus]]), and the density of the medium. Longitudinal (or compression) waves in solids depend on the same two factors with the addition of a dependence on [[compressibility]].

In fluids, only the medium's compressibility and density are the important factors, since fluids do not transmit shear stresses. In heterogeneous fluids, such as a liquid filled with gas bubbles, the density of the liquid and the compressibility of the gas affect the speed of sound in an additive manner, as demonstrated in the [[hot chocolate effect]].

In gases, adiabatic compressibility is directly related to pressure through the [[heat capacity ratio]] (adiabatic index), and pressure and density are inversely related at a given temperature and composition, thus making only the latter independent properties (temperature, molecular composition, and heat capacity ratio) important. In low [[molecular weight]] gases such as [[helium]], sound propagates faster compared to heavier gases such as [[xenon]] (for monatomic gases the speed of sound is about 75% of the mean speed that molecules move in the gas). For a given [[ideal gas]] the speed of sound depends only on its [[temperature]]. At a constant temperature, the ideal gas [[pressure]] has no effect on the speed of sound, because pressure and [[density]] (also proportional to pressure) have equal but opposite effects on the speed of sound, and the two contributions cancel out exactly. In a similar way, compression waves in solids depend both on compressibility and density—just as in liquids—but in gases the density contributes to the compressibility in such a way that some part of each attribute factors out, leaving only a dependence on temperature, molecular weight, and heat capacity ratio (see derivations below). Thus, for a single given gas (where molecular weight does not change) and over a small temperature range (where heat capacity is relatively constant), the speed of sound becomes dependent on only the temperature of the gas.

In non-ideal gases, such as a [[Van der Waals equation|van der Waals gas]], the proportionality is not exact, and there is a slight dependence of sound velocity on the gas pressure.

Humidity has a small but measurable effect on speed of sound (causing it to increase by about 0.1%–0.6%), because [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] molecules of the air are replaced by lighter molecules of [[water]]. This is a simple mixing effect.

==Altitude variation and implications for atmospheric acoustics==
[[File:Comparison US standard atmosphere 1962.svg|thumb|Density and pressure decrease smoothly with altitude, but temperature (red) does not. The speed of sound (blue) depends only on the complicated temperature variation at altitude and can be calculated from it, since isolated density and pressure effects on the speed of sound cancel each other. Speed of sound increases with height in two regions of the stratosphere and thermosphere, due to heating effects in these regions.]] 

In the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the chief factor affecting the speed of sound is the [[temperature]]. For a given ideal gas with constant heat capacity and composition, the speed of sound is dependent ''solely'' upon temperature; see [[Speed of sound#Details|Details]] below. In such an ideal case, the effects of decreased density and decreased pressure of altitude cancel each other out, save for the residual effect of temperature.

Since temperature (and thus the speed of sound) decreases with increasing altitude up to {{nobreak|11 km}}, sound is [[refraction|refracted]] upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an [[acoustic shadow]] at some distance from the source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everest2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decrease of the speed of sound with height is referred to as a negative [[sound speed gradient]].

However, there are variations in this trend above {{nobreak|11 km}}. In particular, in the [[stratosphere]] above about {{nobreak|20 km}}, the speed of sound increases with height, due to an increase in temperature from heating within the [[ozone layer]]. This produces a positive speed of sound gradient in this region. Still another region of positive gradient occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named [[thermosphere]] above {{nobreak|90 km}}.

==Practical formula for dry air==
[[File:Speed of sound in dry air.svg|thumb|Approximation of the speed of sound in dry air based on the [[heat capacity ratio]] (in green) against the truncated [[Taylor expansion]] (in red).]]

The approximate speed of sound in dry (0% humidity) air, in meters per second, at temperatures near {{nobreak|0 °C}}, can be calculated from
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = (331.3 + 0.606 \cdot \vartheta)~\mathrm{m/s},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''θ'' is the temperature in degrees [[Celsius]] (°C).

This equation is derived from the first two terms of the [[Taylor expansion]] of the following more accurate equation:
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = 331.3~\mathrm{m/s} \sqrt{1 + \frac{\vartheta}{273.15}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing the first part, and multiplying the second part, on the right hand side, by √273.15 gives the exactly equivalent form
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = 20.05~\mathrm{m/s} \sqrt{\vartheta + 273.15}.&lt;/math&gt;

The value of {{nobreak|331.3 m/s}}, which represents the speed at {{nobreak|0 °C}} (or {{nobreak|273.15 K}}), is based on theoretical (and some measured) values of the [[heat capacity ratio]], ''γ'', as well as on the fact that at 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] real air is very well described by the ideal gas approximation. Commonly found values for the speed of sound at {{nobreak|0 °C}} may vary from 331.2 to 331.6 due to the assumptions made when it is calculated. If ideal gas ''γ'' is assumed to be {{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}} exactly, the {{nobreak|0 °C}} speed is calculated (see section below) to be {{nobreak|331.3 m/s}}, the coefficient used above.

This equation is correct to a much wider temperature range, but still depends on the approximation of heat capacity ratio being independent of temperature, and for this reason will fail, particularly at higher temperatures. It gives good predictions in relatively dry, cold, low pressure conditions, such as the Earth's [[stratosphere]]. The equation fails at extremely low pressures and short wavelengths, due to dependence on the assumption that the wavelength of the sound in the gas is much longer than the average [[mean free path]] between gas molecule collisions. A derivation of these equations will be given in the following section.

A graph comparing results of the two equations is at right, using the slightly different value of {{nobreak|331.5 m/s}} for the speed of sound at {{nobreak|0 °C}}.

==Details==
===Speed of sound in ideal gases and air===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Supersonic]] --&gt;
For an ideal gas, ''K'' (the [[bulk modulus]] in equations above, equivalent to C, the coefficient of stiffness in solids) is given by
: &lt;math&gt;K = \gamma \cdot p,&lt;/math&gt;
thus, from the Newton–Laplace equation above, the speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by
: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot {p \over \rho}},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''γ'' is the [[adiabatic index]] also known as the ''isentropic expansion factor''. It is the ratio of specific heats of a gas at a constant-pressure to a gas at a constant-volume(&lt;math&gt;C_p/C_v&lt;/math&gt;), and arises because a classical sound wave induces an adiabatic compression, in which the heat of the compression does not have enough time to escape the pressure pulse, and thus contributes to the pressure induced by the compression;
* ''p'' is the [[pressure]];
* ''ρ'' is the [[density]].

Using the [[ideal gas]] law to replace ''p'' with ''nRT''/''V'', and replacing ''ρ'' with ''nM''/''V'', the equation for an ideal gas becomes
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{ideal}} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot {p \over \rho}} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot R \cdot T \over M} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot k \cdot T \over m},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''c''&lt;sub&gt;ideal&lt;/sub&gt; is the speed of sound in an [[ideal gas]];
* ''R'' (approximately {{nobreak|8.314,5 J · mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is the [[molar gas constant]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = CODATA Value: molar gas constant

| accessdate = 24 October 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]];
* ''γ'' (gamma) is the [[adiabatic index]] (sometimes assumed {{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.400}} for diatomic molecules from kinetic theory, assuming from quantum theory a temperature range at which thermal energy is fully partitioned into rotation (rotations are fully excited), but none into vibrational modes. Gamma is actually experimentally measured over a range from 1.399,1 to 1.403 at {{nobreak|0 °C}}, for air. Gamma is assumed from kinetic theory to be exactly {{nobreak|1=5/3 = 1.666,7}} for monatomic gases such as [[noble gas]]es);
* ''T'' is the absolute temperature;
* ''M'' is the molar mass of the gas. The mean molar mass for dry air is about {{nobreak|0.028,964,5 kg/mol}};
* ''n'' is the number of moles;
* ''m'' is the mass of a single molecule.

This equation applies only when the sound wave is a small perturbation on the ambient condition, and the certain other noted conditions are fulfilled, as noted below. Calculated values for ''c''&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; have been found to vary slightly from experimentally determined values.&lt;ref name=USSA1976&gt;U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] famously considered the speed of sound before most of the development of [[thermodynamics]] and so incorrectly used [[isothermal]] calculations instead of [[adiabatic]]. His result was missing the factor of ''γ'' but was otherwise correct.

Numerical substitution of the above values gives the ideal gas approximation of sound velocity for gases, which is accurate at relatively low gas pressures and densities (for air, this includes standard Earth sea-level conditions). Also, for diatomic gases the use of {{nobreak|1=''γ'' = 1.400,0}} requires that the gas exists in a temperature range high enough that rotational heat capacity is fully excited (i.e., molecular rotation is fully used as a heat energy &quot;partition&quot; or reservoir); but at the same time the temperature must be low enough that molecular vibrational modes contribute no heat capacity (i.e., insignificant heat goes into vibration, as all vibrational quantum modes above the minimum-energy-mode, have energies too high to be populated by a significant number of molecules at this temperature). For air, these conditions are fulfilled at room temperature, and also temperatures considerably below room temperature (see tables below). See the section on gases in [[specific heat capacity]] for a more complete discussion of this phenomenon.

For air, we use a simplified symbol
: &lt;math&gt;R_* = R/M_{\mathrm{air}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, if temperatures in degrees [[Celsius]](°C) are to be used to calculate air speed in the region near 273 kelvin, then Celsius temperature {{nobreak|1=''θ'' = ''T'' − 273.15}} may be used. Then
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{ideal}} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot R_* \cdot T} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot R_* \cdot (\vartheta + 273.15)},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{ideal}} = \sqrt{\gamma \cdot R_* \cdot 273.15} \cdot \sqrt{1 + \frac{\vartheta}{273.15}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For dry air, where ''θ'' (theta) is the temperature in degrees [[Celsius]](°C).

Making the following numerical substitutions,
: &lt;math&gt;R = 8.314,510~\mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}&lt;/math&gt;
is the molar [[gas constant]] in J/mole/Kelvin, and
: &lt;math&gt;M_{\mathrm{air}} = 0.028,964,5~\mathrm{kg/mol}&lt;/math&gt;
is the mean molar mass of air, in kg; and using the ideal diatomic gas value of {{nobreak|1=''γ'' = 1.400,0}}.

Then
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = 331.3~\mathrm{m/s} \sqrt{1 + \frac{\vartheta^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}{273.15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the first two terms of the Taylor expansion:
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = 331.3~\mathrm{m/s} (1 + \frac{\vartheta^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}{2 \cdot 273.15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{air}} = (331.3 + 0.606^{\circ}\mathrm{C}^{-1} \cdot \vartheta)~\mathrm{m/s}.&lt;/math&gt;

The derivation includes the first two equations given in the ''Practical formula for dry'' air section above.

===Effects due to wind shear===
The speed of sound varies with temperature. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is [[refraction|refracted]] upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an [[acoustic shadow]] at some distance from the source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everest2001&quot; /&gt; Wind shear of 4 m/(s · km) can produce refraction equal to a typical temperature [[lapse rate]] of {{nobreak|7.5 °C/km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In fact, assuming an [[ideal gas]], the speed of sound ''c'' depends on temperature only, '''not on the pressure''' or '''density''' (since these change in lockstep for a given temperature and cancel out). Air is almost an ideal gas. The temperature of the air varies with altitude, giving the following variations in the speed of sound using the standard atmosphere—''actual conditions may vary''.

==Effect of frequency and gas composition==
===General physical considerations===
The medium in which a sound wave is travelling does not always respond adiabatically, and as a result the speed of sound can vary with frequency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Beaumont Wood|A B Wood]], A Textbook of Sound (Bell, London, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

The limitations of the concept of speed of sound due to extreme attenuation are also of concern. The attenuation which exists at sea level for high frequencies applies to successively lower frequencies as atmospheric pressure decreases, or as the [[mean free path]] increases. For this reason, the concept of speed of sound (except for frequencies approaching zero) progressively loses its range of applicability at high altitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;USSA1976&quot;/&gt; The standard equations for the speed of sound apply with reasonable accuracy only to situations in which the wavelength of the soundwave is considerably longer than the mean free path of molecules in a gas.

The molecular composition of the gas contributes both as the mass (M) of the molecules, and their heat capacities, and so both have an influence on speed of sound. In general, at the same molecular mass, monatomic gases have slightly higher speed of sound (over 9% higher) because they have a higher ''γ'' ({{nobreak|1=5/3 = 1.66}}…) than diatomics do ({{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}}). Thus, at the same molecular mass, the speed of sound of a monatomic gas goes up by a factor of
: &lt;math&gt;{c_{\mathrm{gas,monatomic}} \over c_{\mathrm{gas,diatomic}}} = \sqrt{{{{5/3} \over {7/5}}}} = \sqrt{25 \over 21} = 1.091\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the 9% difference, and would be a typical ratio for speeds of sound at room temperature in [[helium]] vs. [[deuterium]], each with a molecular weight of 4. Sound travels faster in helium than deuterium because adiabatic compression heats helium more, since the helium molecules can store heat energy from compression only in translation, but not rotation. Thus helium molecules (monatomic molecules) travel faster in a sound wave and transmit sound faster. (Sound generally travels at about 70% of the mean molecular speed in gases).

Note that in this example we have assumed that temperature is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by molecular vibration (see [[heat capacity]]). However, vibrational modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas gives the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and sound velocity. Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and vibrational heat capacity acts to increase the difference between the speed of sound in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.

===Practical application to air===
By far the most important factor influencing the speed of sound in air is temperature. The speed is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature, giving an increase of about {{nobreak|0.6 m/s}} per degree Celsius. For this reason, the pitch of a musical wind instrument increases as its temperature increases.

The speed of sound is raised by humidity but decreased by carbon dioxide. The difference between 0% and 100% humidity is about {{nobreak|1.5 m/s}} at standard pressure and temperature, but the size of the humidity effect increases dramatically with temperature. The carbon dioxide content of air is not fixed, due to both carbon pollution and human breath (e.g., in the air blown through wind instruments).

The dependence on frequency and pressure are normally insignificant in practical applications. In dry air, the speed of sound increases by about {{nobreak|0.1 m/s}} as the frequency rises from {{nobreak|10 Hz}} to {{nobreak|100 Hz}}. For audible frequencies above {{nobreak|100 Hz}} it is relatively constant. Standard values of the speed of sound are quoted in the limit of low frequencies, where the wavelength is large compared to the mean free path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mach number, a useful quantity in aerodynamics, is the ratio of air [[speed]] to the local speed of sound. At altitude, for reasons explained, Mach number is a function of temperature.
Aircraft [[flight instruments]], however, operate using pressure differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. The assumption is that a particular pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft flight instruments need to operate this way because the stagnation pressure sensed by a [[Pitot tube]] is dependent on altitude as well as speed.

==Experimental methods==
A range of different methods exist for the measurement of sound in air.

The earliest reasonably accurate estimate of the speed of sound in air was made by [[William Derham]], and acknowledged by [[Isaac Newton]]. Derham had a telescope at the top of the tower of the [[Church of St Laurence, Upminster|Church of St Laurence]] in [[Upminster]], England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance/time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final estimate of the speed of sound. Modern stopwatches enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200–400 meters, and not needing something as loud as a shotgun.

===Single-shot timing methods===
The simplest concept is the measurement made using two [[microphone]]s and a fast recording device such as a [[Digital data|digital]] storage scope. This method uses the following idea.

If a sound source and two microphones are arranged in a straight line, with the sound source at one end, then the following can be measured:
# The distance between the microphones (''x''), called microphone basis.
# The time of arrival between the signals (delay) reaching the different microphones (''t'').

Then ''v'' = ''x''/''t''.

===Other methods===
In these methods the [[time]] measurement has been replaced by a measurement of the inverse of time ([[frequency]]).

[[Kundt's tube]] is an example of an experiment which can be used to measure the speed of sound in a small volume. It has the advantage of being able to measure the speed of sound in any gas. This method uses a powder to make the [[Node (physics)|nodes]] and [[antinode]]s visible to the human eye. This is an example of a compact experimental setup.

A [[tuning fork]] can be held near the mouth of a long [[pipe (material)|pipe]] which is dipping into a barrel of [[water]]. In this system it is the case that the pipe can be brought to resonance if the length of the air column in the pipe is equal to ''(1 + 2''n'')λ/4'' where ''n'' is an integer. As the [[antinode|antinodal]] point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.

Here it is the case that ''v'' = ''fλ''.

===High-precision measurements in air===
The effect from impurities can be significant when making high-precision measurements. Chemical [[Desiccant|desiccants]] can be used to dry the air, but will in turn contaminate the sample. The air can be dried cryogenically, but this has the effect of removing the carbon dioxide as well; therefore many high-precision measurements are performed with air free of carbon dioxide rather than with natural air. A 2002 review&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerwar, Handbook of the speed of sound in real gases, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; found that a 1963 measurement by Smith and Harlow using a cylindrical resonator gave &quot;the most probable value of the standard speed of sound to date.&quot; The experiment was done with air from which the carbon dioxide had been removed, but the result was then corrected for this effect so as to be applicable to real air. The experiments were done at {{nobreak|30 °C}} but corrected for temperature in order to report them at {{nobreak|0 °C}}. The result was {{nobreak|331.45 ± 0.01 m/s}} for dry air at STP, for frequencies from {{nobreak|93 Hz}} to {{nobreak|1,500 Hz}}.

==Non-gaseous media==
===Speed of sound in solids===
====Three-dimensional solids====
In a solid, there is a non-zero stiffness both for volumetric deformations and shear deformations. Hence, it is possible to generate sound waves with different velocities dependent
on the deformation mode. Sound waves generating volumetric deformations (compression) and shear deformations (shearing) are called pressure waves (longitudinal waves) and shear waves (transverse waves), respectively. In [[earthquake]]s, the corresponding seismic waves are called [[P-wave]]s (primary waves) and [[S-wave]]s (secondary waves), respectively. The sound velocities of these two types of waves propagating in a homogeneous 3-dimensional solid are respectively given by&lt;ref name=&quot;E. Kinsler 2000&quot;&gt;L. E. Kinsler et al. (2000), ''Fundamentals of acoustics'', 4th Ed., John Wiley and sons Inc., New York, USA&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{solid,p}} = \sqrt{\frac{K + \frac{4}{3}G}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\frac{E(1 - \nu)}{\rho (1 + \nu)(1 - 2 \nu)}},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{solid,s}} = \sqrt{\frac{G}{\rho}},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''K'' is the [[bulk modulus]] of the elastic materials;
* ''G'' is the [[shear modulus]] of the elastic materials;
* ''E'' is the [[Young's modulus]];
* ''ρ'' is the density;
* ''ν'' is [[Poisson's ratio]].

The last quantity is not an independent one, as {{nobreak|1=E = 3K(1 − 2ν)}}. Note that the speed of pressure waves depends both on the pressure and shear resistance properties of the material, while the speed of shear waves depends on the shear properties only.

Typically, pressure waves travel faster in materials than do shear waves, and in earthquakes this is the reason that the onset of an earthquake is often preceded by a quick upward-downward shock, before arrival of waves that produce a side-to-side motion. For example, for a typical steel alloy, {{nobreak|1=''K'' = 170 GPa}}, {{nobreak|1=''G'' = 80 GPa}} and {{nobreak|1=''ρ'' = 7,700 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, yielding a compressional speed ''c''&lt;sub&gt;solid,p&lt;/sub&gt; of {{nobreak|6,000 m/s}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;E. Kinsler 2000&quot;/&gt; This is in reasonable agreement with ''c''&lt;sub&gt;solid,p&lt;/sub&gt; measured experimentally at {{nobreak|5,930 m/s}} for a (possibly different) type of steel.&lt;ref&gt;J. Krautkrämer and H. Krautkrämer (1990), ''Ultrasonic testing of materials'', 4th fully revised edition, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; The shear speed ''c''&lt;sub&gt;solid,s&lt;/sub&gt; is estimated at {{nobreak|3,200 m/s}} using the same numbers.

====One-dimensional solids====
The speed of sound for pressure waves in stiff materials such as metals is sometimes given for &quot;long rods&quot; of the material in question, in which the speed is easier to measure. In rods where their diameter is shorter than a wavelength, the speed of pure pressure waves may be simplified and is given by:
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{solid}} = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is the [[Young's modulus]]. This is similar to the expression for shear waves, save that [[Young's modulus]] replaces the [[shear modulus]]. This speed of sound for pressure waves in long rods will always be slightly less than the same speed in homogeneous 3-dimensional solids, and the ratio of the speeds in the two different types of objects depends on [[Poisson's ratio]] for the material.

===Speed of sound in liquids===
[[File:Speed of sound in water.svg|thumb|right|Speed of sound in water vs temperature.]]
In a fluid the only non-zero [[stiffness]] is to volumetric deformation (a fluid does not sustain shear forces).

Hence the speed of sound in a fluid is given by
: &lt;math&gt;c_{\mathrm{fluid}} = \sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''K'' is the [[bulk modulus]] of the fluid.

====Water====
In fresh water, sound travels at about {{nobreak|1497 m/s}} at {{nobreak|25 °C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Seawater====

In salt water that is free of air bubbles or suspended sediment, sound travels at about {{nobreak|1500 m/s}}.{{huh|date=August 2014}} The speed of sound in seawater depends on pressure (hence depth), temperature (a change of {{nobreak|1 °C}} ~ {{nobreak|4 m/s}}), and [[salinity]] (a change of 1[[Per mil|‰]] ~ {{nobreak|1 m/s}}), and empirical equations have been derived to accurately calculate the speed of sound from these variables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADB199453 APL-UW TR 9407 High-Frequency Ocean Environmental Acoustic Models Handbook], pp. I1-I2.&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors affecting the speed of sound are minor. Since temperature decreases with depth while pressure and generally salinity increase, the profile of the speed of sound with depth generally shows a characteristic curve which decreases to a minimum at a depth of several hundred meters, then increases again with increasing depth (right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Speed of sound in plasma===
The speed of sound in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] for the common case that the electrons are hotter than the ions (but not too much hotter) is given by the formula (see [[Plasma parameters#Velocities|here]])
: &lt;math&gt;c_s = (\gamma ZkT_\mathrm{e}/m_\mathrm{i})^{1/2} = 9.79 \times 10^3(\gamma ZT_e/\mu)^{1/2}~\mathrm{m/s},&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''m''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[ion]] mass;
* ''μ'' is the ratio of ion mass to [[proton]] mass {{nobreak|1=''μ'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;/''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}};
* ''T''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electron]] temperature;
* ''Z'' is the charge state;
* ''k'' is [[Boltzmann constant]];
* ''γ'' is the [[adiabatic index]].

In contrast to a gas, the pressure and the density are provided by separate species, the pressure by the electrons and the density by the ions. The two are coupled through a fluctuating electric field.

==Gradients==
{{main|Sound speed gradient}}
When sound spreads out evenly in all directions in three dimensions, the intensity drops in proportion to the inverse square of the distance. However, in the ocean there is a layer called the 'deep sound channel' or [[SOFAR channel]] which can confine sound waves at a particular depth.

In the SOFAR channel, the speed of sound is lower than that in the layers above and below. Just as light waves will refract towards a region of higher [[refractive index|index]], sound waves will [[refraction|refract]] towards a region where their speed is reduced. The result is that sound gets confined in the layer, much the way light can be confined in a sheet of glass or [[optical fiber]]. Thus, the sound is confined in essentially two dimensions. In two dimensions the intensity drops in proportion to only the inverse of the distance. This allows waves to travel much further before being undetectably faint.

A similar effect occurs in the atmosphere. [[Project Mogul]] successfully used this effect to detect a [[nuclear explosion]] at a considerable distance.

[[File:Permeability by Zureks.svg|thumb|Simplified comparison of permeabilities for: [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]] (&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;), [[paramagnetism|paramagnets]](&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), free space(&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[diamagnetism|diamagnets]] (&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;)]]

In [[electromagnetism]], '''permeability''' is the measure of the ability of a material to support the formation of a [[magnetic field]] within itself. Hence, it is the degree of [[magnetization]] that a material obtains in response to an applied magnetic field. Magnetic permeability is typically represented by the Greek letter [[Mu (letter)|''μ'']]. The term was coined in September 1885 by [[Oliver Heaviside]]. The reciprocal of magnetic permeability is ''magnetic reluctivity''.

In [[SI]] units, permeability is measured in [[Henry (unit)|henries]] per meter (H·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), or [[newton (unit)|newtons]] per [[ampere]] squared (N·A&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). The permeability constant (''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), also known as the [[magnetic constant]] or the permeability of free space, is a measure of the amount of resistance encountered when forming a magnetic field in a classical [[vacuum]]. The magnetic constant has the exact (defined)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/ampere.html |title=The NIST reference on fundamental physical constants |publisher=Physics.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; value ''µ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 4''π''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; H·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;≈ 1.2566370614…×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;H·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or N·A&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).

A closely related property of materials is [[magnetic susceptibility]], which is a dimensionless proportionality factor that indicates the degree of magnetization of a material in response to an applied magnetic field.

==Explanation==
In [[electromagnetism]], the [[Magnetic field#The H-field|auxiliary magnetic field]] '''H''' represents how a magnetic field '''B''' influences the organization of magnetic dipoles in a given medium, including dipole migration and magnetic [[dipole]] reorientation. Its relation to permeability is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}=\mu \mathbf{H},&lt;/math&gt;

where the permeability, ''μ'', is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] if the medium is [[isotropic]] or a second rank [[tensor]] for an anisotropic medium.

In general, permeability is not a constant, as it can vary with the position in the medium, the frequency of the field applied, [[humidity]], temperature, and other parameters.  In a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear medium]], the permeability can depend on the strength of the magnetic field.   Permeability as a function of frequency can take on real or complex values.  In [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials, the relationship between '''B''' and '''H''' exhibits both [[nonlinear optics|non-linearity]] and [[hysteresis]]:  '''B''' is not a single-valued function of '''H''',&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1975), p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; but depends also on the history of the material. For these materials it is sometimes useful to consider the ''incremental permeability'' defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{B}=\mu_{\Delta} \Delta\mathbf{H}.&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is useful in local linearizations of non-linear material behavior, for example in a [[Newton–Raphson]] iterative solution scheme that computes the changing [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturation]] of a magnetic circuit.

Permeability is the [[inductance]] per unit length.  In [[SI]] units, permeability is measured in [[henry (unit)|henries]] per metre (H·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= J/(A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·m)&amp;nbsp;= N A&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). The auxiliary magnetic field '''H''' has dimensions [[Electric current|current]] per unit length and is measured in units of [[ampere]]s  per metre (A m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). The product ''μ''&amp;nbsp;'''H''' thus has dimensions inductance times current per unit area (H·A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  But inductance is [[magnetic flux]] per unit current, so the product has dimensions magnetic flux per unit area.  This is just the magnetic field '''B''', which is measured in [[weber (unit)|webers]] ([[volt]]-[[second]]s) per square-metre (V·s/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or [[tesla (unit)|teslas]]&amp;nbsp;(T).

'''B''' is related to the [[Lorentz force]] on a moving charge ''q'':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}).&lt;/math&gt;

The charge ''q'' is given in [[coulomb]]s (C), the velocity ''v'' in [[meter]]s per [[second]] (m/s), so that the force ''F'' is in [[newton (unit)|newtons]] (N):
:&lt;math&gt;q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}
 = C \cdot \dfrac{m}{s} \cdot \dfrac{V \cdot s}{m^2}
 = \dfrac{C \cdot (J / C)}{m}
 = \dfrac{J}{m} = N&lt;/math&gt;

'''H''' is related to the [[Dipole#Field of a static magnetic dipole|magnetic dipole]] density.  A magnetic dipole is a closed circulation of electric current.  The dipole moment has dimensions current times area, units ampere square-metre (A·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and magnitude equal to the current around the loop times the area of the loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Jackson, John David | title=Classical Electrodynamics | edition=2nd | location=New York | publisher=Wiley | year=1975 | isbn=0-471-43132-X}} p. 182 eqn. (5.57)&lt;/ref&gt;  The '''H''' field at a distance from a dipole has magnitude proportional to the dipole moment divided by distance cubed,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1975) p. 182 eqn. (5.56)&lt;/ref&gt; which has dimensions current per unit length.

== Relative permeability and magnetic susceptibility==
Relative permeability, sometimes denoted by the symbol ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, is the ratio of the permeability of a specific medium to the permeability of free space ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 4''π''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;N&amp;nbsp;A&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In terms of relative permeability, the [[magnetic susceptibility]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_m = \mu_r - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The number ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[dimensionless quantity]], sometimes called ''volumetric'' or ''bulk'' susceptibility, to distinguish it from ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (''magnetic mass'' or ''specific'' susceptibility) and ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; (''molar'' or ''molar mass'' susceptibility).

==Diamagnetism==
{{main|Diamagnetism}}
''Diamagnetism'' is the property of an object which causes it to create a [[magnetic field]] in opposition of an externally applied magnetic field, thus causing a repulsive effect. Specifically, an external magnetic field alters the orbital velocity of electrons around their nuclei, thus changing the [[magnetic dipole moment]] in the direction opposing the external field. Diamagnets are materials with a [[magnetic permeability]] less than ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (a relative permeability less than 1).

Consequently, diamagnetism is a form of [[magnetism]] that a substance exhibits only in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. It is generally a quite weak effect in most materials, although [[superconductor]]s exhibit a strong effect.

==Paramagnetism==
{{main|Paramagnetism}}
''Paramagnetism'' is a form of [[magnetism]] which occurs only in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials are attracted to magnetic fields, hence  have a relative magnetic permeability greater than [[1 (number)|one]] (or, equivalently, a positive [[magnetic susceptibility]]).
The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is ''linear'' in the field strength and rather ''weak''. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect. Unlike [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]], paramagnets do not retain any magnetization in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field, because [[thermal motion]] causes the spins to become ''randomly oriented'' without it. Thus the total magnetization will drop to zero when the applied field is removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a small ''induced'' magnetization because only a small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnets is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily observed, for instance, in magnets on one's refrigerator.

==Gyromagnetism==
For gyromagnetic media (see  [[Faraday rotation]]) the magnetic permeability response to an alternating electromagnetic field in the microwave frequency domain  is treated as a non-diagonal tensor expressed by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kales | first1 = M.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{B}(\omega) &amp; = \begin{vmatrix}

0 &amp; 0 &amp; \mu_{z}\\
\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{H}(\omega)\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Values for some common materials==
The following table should be used with caution as the permeability of ferromagnetic materials varies greatly with field strength. For example 4% Si steel has an initial relative permeability (at or near 0T) of 2,000 and a maximum of 35,000&lt;ref&gt;G.W.C. Kaye &amp; T.H. Laby, Table of Physical and Chemical Constants, 14th ed, Longman&lt;/ref&gt; and, indeed, the relative permeability of any material at a sufficiently high field strength trends toward 1.

A good [[Magnetic core#Magnetic core materials|magnetic core material]] must have high permeability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

For ''passive'' [[magnetic levitation]] a relative permeability below 1 is needed (corresponding to a negative susceptibility).

Permeability varies with magnetic field. Values shown above are approximate and valid only at the magnetic fields shown. They are given for a zero frequency; in practice, the permeability is generally a function of the frequency. When frequency is considered, the permeability can be [[Complex number|complex]], corresponding to the in phase and out of phase response.

Note that the [[magnetic constant]] ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; has an exact value in [[SI]] units (that is, there is no uncertainty in its value) because the [[ampere#Definition|definition of the ampere]] fixes its value to 4''π''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;H/m exactly.

==Complex permeability==
A useful tool for dealing with high frequency magnetic effects is the complex permeability. While at low frequencies in a linear material the magnetic field and the auxiliary magnetic field are simply proportional to each other through some scalar permeability, at high frequencies these quantities will react to each other with some lag time.&lt;ref name=&quot;getzlaff&quot;&gt;M. Getzlaff, ''Fundamentals of magnetism'', Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These fields can be written as [[Phasor (electronics)|phasors]], such that
:&lt;math&gt;H=H_0 e^{j \omega t} \qquad B=B_0 e^{j\left(\omega t - \delta \right)}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the phase delay of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. Understanding permeability as the ratio of the magnetic flux density to the magnetic field, the ratio of the phasors can be written and simplified as
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{B}{H} = \frac{ B_0 e^{j\left(\omega t - \delta \right) }}{H_0 e^{j \omega t}} = \frac{B_0}{H_0}e^{-j\delta},&lt;/math&gt;
so that the permeability becomes a complex number.
By [[Euler's formula]], the complex permeability can be translated from polar to rectangular form,
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{B_0}{H_0}\cos \delta - j \frac{B_0}{H_0}\sin\delta = \mu^\prime - j \mu ^{\prime\prime}.&lt;/math&gt;
The ratio of the imaginary to the real part of the complex permeability is called the [[loss tangent]],
:&lt;math&gt;\tan\delta = \frac{\mu^{\prime\prime}}{\mu^\prime},&lt;/math&gt;
which provides a measure of how much power is lost in a material versus how much is stored.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13628">:''For a table of volumetric heat capacities, see [[Heat capacity#Table of specific heat capacities]].''
'''Volumetric heat capacity''' ('''VHC'''), also termed '''volume-specific [[heat capacity]]''', describes the ability of a given [[volume]] of a substance to store [[internal energy]] while undergoing a given [[temperature]] change, but without undergoing a [[phase transition]]. It is different from [[specific heat capacity]] in that the VHC is a 'per unit volume' measure of the relationship between thermal energy and temperature of a material, while the specific heat is a 'per unit [[mass]]' measure (or occasionally per molar quantity of the material). If given a specific heat value of a substance, one can convert it to the VHC by [[multiplication|multiply]]ing the specific heat by the [[density]] of the substance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wbdg.org/ccb/ARMYCOE/COETM/ARCHIVES/tm_5_852_6.pdf''U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Technical Manual: Arctic and Subarctic Construction: Calculation Methods for Determination of Depths of Freeze and Thaw in Soils'', TM 5-852-6/AFR 88-19, Volume 6, 1988, Equation 2-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Louis Dulong|Dulong]] and [[Alexis Thérèse Petit|Petit]] predicted in 1818 {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} that the product of solid substance density and specific heat capacity (ρc&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) would be constant for all solids. This amounted to a prediction that volumetric heat capacity in solids would be constant. In 1819 they found that volumetric heat capacities were not quite constant, but that the most constant quantity was the heat capacity of solids adjusted by the presumed weight of the atoms of the substance, as defined by Dalton (the [[Dulong–Petit law]]). This quantity was proportional to the heat capacity per [[atomic weight]] (or per [[molar mass]]), which suggested that it is the heat capacity '''''per atom''''' (not per unit of volume) which is closest to being a constant in solids. Eventually (see the discussion in [[heat capacity]]) it became clear that heat capacities per particle for all substances in all states are the same, to within a factor of two, so long as temperatures are not in the cryogenic range. For very cold temperatures, heat capacities fall drastically and eventually approach zero as temperature approaches zero.

The heat capacity ''on a volumetric basis'' in solid materials at room temperatures and above varies more widely, from about 1.2 MJ/m³K (for example [[bismuth]]&lt;ref&gt;Based on values in [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/sphtt.html#c1 this table] and density.&lt;/ref&gt;) to 3.5 MJ/m³K (for example iron&lt;ref&gt;Based on [http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C7439896&amp;Mask=2&amp;Type=JANAFS&amp;Table=on#JANAFS NIST data] and density.&lt;/ref&gt;), but this is mostly due to differences in the physical size of atoms. See a discussion in [[atom]]. Atoms vary greatly in density, with the heaviest often being more dense, and thus are closer to taking up the same average volume in solids than their mass alone would predict. If all atoms ''were'' the same size, molar and volumetric heat capacity would be proportional and differ by only a single constant reflecting ratios of the atomic-molar-volume of materials (their atomic density). An additional factor for all types of specific heat capacities (including molar specific heats) then further reflects degrees of freedom available to the atoms composing the substance, at various temperatures.

For most liquids, the volumetric heat capacity is narrower, for example [[octane]] at 1.64 MJ/m³K or [[ethanol]] at 1.9. This reflects the modest loss of degrees of freedom for particles in liquids as compared with solids.

However, [[water]] has a very high volumetric heat capacity, at 4.18 MJ/m³K, and [[ammonia]] is also fairly high (3.3).

For gases at room temperature, the range of volumetric heat capacities per atom (not per molecule) only varies between different gases by a small factor less than two, because every [[ideal gas]] has the same [[molar volume]]. Thus, each gas molecule occupies the same mean volume in all ideal gases, regardless of the type of gas (see [[kinetic theory]]). This fact gives each gas molecule the same effective &quot;volume&quot; in all ideal gases (although this volume/molecule in gases is far larger than molecules occupy on average in solids or liquids). Thus, in the limit of ideal gas behavior (which many gases approximate except at low temperatures and/or extremes of pressure) this property reduces differences in gas volumetric heat capacity to simple differences in the heat capacities of individual molecules. As noted, these differ by a factor depending on the degrees of freedom available to particles within the molecules.

==Gas volumetric heat capacities==
Large complex gas molecules may have high heat capacities per mole of gas molecules, but their heat capacities per mole of total gas '''atoms''' are very similar to those of liquids and solids, again differing by less than a factor of two per mole of atoms. This factor of two represents vibrational degrees of freedom available in solids vs. gas molecules of various complexities.

In monatomic gases (like argon) at room temperature and constant volume, volumetric heat capacities are all very close to 0.5 kJ/m³K, which is the same as the theoretical value of 3/2 RT per kelvin per mole of gas molecules (where '''R''' is the [[gas constant]] and T is temperature). As noted, the much lower values for gas heat capacity in terms of volume as compared with solids (although more comparable per mole, see below) results mostly from the fact that gases under standard conditions consist of mostly empty space (about 99.9% of volume), which is not filled by the atomic volumes of the atoms in the gas. Since the molar volume of gases is very roughly 1000 times that of solids and liquids, this results in a factor of about 1000 loss in volumetric heat capacity for gases, as compared with liquids and solids. Monatomic gas heat capacities per atom (not per molecule) are decreased by a factor of 2 with regard to solids, due to loss of half of the potential [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] per atom for storing energy in a monatomic gas, as compared with regard to an ideal solid. There is some difference in the heat capacity of monatomic vs. polyatomic gasses, and also gas heat capacity is temperature-dependent in many ranges for polyatomic gases; these factors act to modestly (up to the discussed factor of 2) increase heat capacity per atom in polyatomic gases, as compared with monatomic gases. Volumetric heat capacities in polyatomic gases vary widely, however, since they are dependent largely on the number of atoms per molecule in the gas, which in turn determines the total number of atoms per volume in the gas.

The volumetric heat capacity is defined as having [[SI]] units of [[joule|J]]/([[cubic metre|m³]]·[[Kelvin|K]]). It can also be described in Imperial units of [[British thermal unit|BTU]]/([[cubic foot|ft³]]·[[Fahrenheit|F°]]).

== Volumetric heat capacity in solids ==
Since&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;the [[bulk density]] of a solid chemical element is strongly related to its molar mass (usually about 3 ''R'' per mole, as noted above), there exists noticeable inverse correlation between a solid’s density and its specific heat capacity on a per-mass basis. This is due to a very approximate tendency of atoms of most elements to be about the same size, despite much wider variations in density and atomic weight. These two factors (constancy of atomic volume and constancy of mole-specific heat capacity) result in a good correlation between the ''volume'' of any given solid chemical element and its total heat capacity. Another way of stating this, is that the volume-specific heat capacity (volumetric heat capacity) of solid elements is roughly a constant. The [[molar volume]] of solid elements is very roughly constant, and (even more reliably) so also is the molar heat capacity for most solid substances. These two factors determine the volumetric heat capacity, which as a bulk property may be striking in consistency. For example, the element uranium is a metal which has a density almost 36 times that of the metal lithium, but uranium's '''volumetric''' heat capacity is only about 20% larger than lithium's.

Since the volume-specific corollary of the Dulong-Petit specific heat capacity relationship requires that atoms of all elements take up (on average) the same volume in solids, there are many departures from it, with most of these due to variations in atomic size. For instance, [[arsenic]], which is only 14.5% less dense than [[antimony]], has nearly 59% more specific heat capacity on a mass basis. In other words; even though an ingot of arsenic is only about 17% larger than an antimony one of the same mass, it absorbs about 59% more heat for a given temperature rise. The heat capacity ratios of the two substances closely follows the ratios of their molar volumes (the ratios of numbers of atoms in the same volume of each substance); the departure from the correlation to simple volumes in this case is due to lighter arsenic atoms being significantly more closely packed than antimony atoms, instead of similar size. In other words, similar-sized atoms would cause a mole of arsenic to be 63% larger than a mole of antimony, with a correspondingly lower density, allowing its volume to more closely mirror its heat capacity behavior.

==Thermal inertia==
''Thermal inertia'' is a term commonly used by [[scientist]]s and [[engineers]] modelling [[heat transfer]]s and is a bulk material property related to [[thermal conductivity]] and volumetric heat capacity. For example, ''this material has a high thermal inertia,'' or ''thermal inertia plays an important role in this system,'' which means that dynamic effects are prevalent in a [[model (abstract)|model]], so that a steady-state calculation will yield inaccurate results.

The term is a scientific analogy, and is not directly related to the mass-and-velocity term used in [[mechanics]], where [[inertia]] is that which limits the [[acceleration]] of an object. In a similar way, thermal inertia is a measure of the thermal mass and the velocity of the thermal wave which controls the surface temperature of a material. In [[heat transfer]], a higher value of the volumetric heat capacity means a longer time for the system to reach [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]].

The thermal inertia of a material is defined as the square root of the product of the material's bulk [[thermal conductivity]] and volumetric heat capacity, where the latter is the product of [[density]] and [[specific heat capacity]]:
:: &lt;math&gt;I=\sqrt{k \rho c}&lt;/math&gt;
See also [[Thermal effusivity]]

* &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is thermal conductivity, with unit [W m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;]
* &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is density, with unit [kg m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;]
* &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is specific heat capacity, with unit [J kg&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;]
* &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; has [[SI]] units of thermal inertia of [J m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;]. Non-SI units of Kieffers [Cal cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;] also used in older references.&lt;ref&gt;http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/ThermalInertia.html ''Eric Weisstein's World of Science - Thermal Inertia''&lt;/ref&gt;

For planetary surface materials, thermal inertia is the key property controlling the diurnal and seasonal surface temperature variations and is typically dependent on the physical properties of near-surface geologic materials. In [[remote sensing]] applications, thermal inertia represents a complex combination of particle size, rock abundance, bedrock outcropping and the degree of induration. A rough approximation to thermal inertia is sometimes obtained from the amplitude of the diurnal temperature curve (i.e., maximum minus minimum surface temperature). The temperature of a material with low thermal inertia changes significantly during the day, while the temperature of a material with high thermal inertia does not change as drastically.
Deriving and understanding the thermal inertia of the surface can help to recognize small-scale features of that surface. In conjunction with other data, thermal inertia can help to characterize surface materials and the geologic processes responsible for forming these materials.

Thermal inertia of the oceans is a major factor influencing [[climate commitment]], the degree of [[global warming]] predicted to eventually result from a step change in [[climate forcing]] such as a fixed increase in the atmospheric concentration of a [[greenhouse gas]].

== Constant volume and constant pressure ==

For gases it is necessary to distinguish between volumetric heat capacity at constant volume and volumetric heat capacity at constant [[pressure]], which is always larger due to the pressure-volume work done as a gas expands during heating at constant pressure (thus absorbing heat which is converted to work). The distinctions between constant-volume and constant-pressure heat capacities are also made in various types of [[specific heat capacity]] (the latter meaning either mass-specific or mole-specific heat capacity).

{{Standard model of particle physics}}

In [[quantum mechanics]] and [[particle physics]], '''spin''' is an intrinsic form of [[angular momentum]] carried by [[elementary particle]]s, composite particles ([[hadron]]s), and [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]].&lt;ref name=&quot;merzbacher372&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Merzbacher|first=Eugen|title=Quantum Mechanics|edition=3rd|year=1998|pages=372&amp;ndash;3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;griffiths183&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David|title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics|edition=2nd|year=2005|pages=183&amp;ndash;4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin is one of two types of angular momentum in quantum mechanics, the other being ''orbital angular momentum''. The orbital [[angular momentum operator]] is the quantum-mechanical counterpart to the classical notion of angular momentum: it arises when a particle executes a rotating or twisting trajectory (such as when an electron orbits a nucleus).&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/751.mf1i.fall02/AngularMomentum.htm &quot;Angular Momentum Operator Algebra&quot;, class notes by Michael Fowler]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=3_7uriPX028C&amp;pg=PA31 ''A modern approach to quantum mechanics'', by Townsend, p. 31 and p. 80]&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of spin angular momentum is inferred from experiments, such as the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]], in which particles are observed to possess angular momentum that cannot be accounted for by orbital angular momentum alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;eisberg272&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisberg|first=Robert|last2=Resnick|first2=Robert|title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particles|edition=2nd|year=1985|pages=272&amp;ndash;3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some ways, spin is like a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity; it has a definite magnitude, and it has a &quot;direction&quot; (but quantization makes this &quot;direction&quot; different from the direction of an ordinary vector). All elementary particles of a given kind have the same magnitude of spin angular momentum, which is indicated by assigning the particle a ''spin [[quantum number]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;griffiths183&quot; /&gt;

The [[SI unit]] of spin is the [[joule-second]], just as with classical angular momentum. In practice, however, it is written as a multiple of the [[reduced Planck constant]] ''ħ'', usually in [[natural units]], where the ''ħ'' is omitted, resulting in a [[unitless]] number. Spin quantum numbers are unitless numbers by definition.

When combined with the [[spin-statistics theorem]], the spin of electrons results in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which in turn underlies the [[periodic table]] of [[chemical element]]s.

[[Wolfgang Pauli]] was the first to propose the concept of spin, but he did not name it. In 1925, [[Ralph Kronig]], [[George Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] at [[Leiden University]] suggested a physical interpretation of particles spinning around their own axis. The mathematical theory was worked out in depth by Pauli in 1927. When [[Paul Dirac]] derived his [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] in 1928, electron spin was an essential part of it.

==Quantum number==

{{main|Spin quantum number}}

As the name suggests, spin was originally conceived as the rotation of a particle around some axis. This picture is correct so far as spin obeys the same mathematical laws as [[angular momentum quantization|quantized]] [[angular momentum|angular momenta]] do. On the other hand, spin has some peculiar properties that distinguish it from orbital angular momenta:
*Spin quantum numbers may take half-integer values.
*Although the direction of its spin can be changed, an elementary particle cannot be made to spin faster or slower.
*The spin of a charged particle is associated with a [[magnetic dipole moment]] with a [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] differing from 1. This could only occur classically [[Gyromagnetic ratio#Gyromagnetic ratio for a classical rotating body|if the internal charge of the particle were distributed differently from its mass]].

The conventional definition of the '''spin quantum number''', ''s'', is ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''/2, where ''n'' can be any [[non-negative]] [[integer]]. Hence the allowed values of ''s'' are 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, etc. The value of ''s'' for an [[elementary particle]] depends only on the type of particle, and cannot be altered in any known way (in contrast to the ''spin direction'' described below). The spin angular momentum, ''S'', of any physical system is [[angular momentum quantization|quantized]]. The allowed values of ''S'' are:

:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{h}{2\pi} \, \sqrt{s (s+1)}=\frac{h}{4\pi} \, \sqrt{n(n+2)},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]. In contrast, [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] can only take on integer values of ''s''; i.e., even-numbered values of ''n''.

===Fermions and bosons===
Those particles with half-integer spins, such as 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, are known as [[fermion]]s, while those particles with integer spins, such as 0, 1, 2, are known as [[bosons]].  The two families of particles obey different rules and ''broadly'' have different roles in the world around us. A key distinction between the two families is that fermions obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]; that is, there cannot be two identical fermions simultaneously having the same quantum numbers (meaning, roughly, having the same position, velocity and spin direction).  In contrast, bosons obey the rules of [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] and have no such restriction, so they may &quot;bunch together&quot; even if in identical states. Also, composite particles can have spins different from the particles which comprise them.  For example, a [[helium atom]] can have spin 0 and therefore can behave like a boson even though the [[quarks]] and electrons which make it up are all fermions.

This has profound practical applications:

* [[Quarks]] and [[leptons]] (including [[electrons]] and [[neutrinos]]), which make up what is classically known as [[matter]], are all fermions with [[spin 1/2]]. The common idea that &quot;matter takes up space&quot; actually comes from the Pauli exclusion principle acting on these particles to prevent the fermions that make up matter from being in the same quantum state. Further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states, and therefore a kind of [[pressure]] (sometimes known as [[degenerate matter|degeneracy pressure of electrons]]) acts to resist the fermions being overly close. It is also this pressure which prevents [[star]]s collapsing inwardly, and which, when it finally gives way under immense gravitational pressure in a dying massive star, triggers inward collapse and the dramatic explosion into a [[supernova]].
:Elementary fermions with other spins (3/2, 5/2 etc.) are not known to exist, as of 2014.
* Elementary particles which are thought of as [[force carrier|carrying forces]] are all bosons with spin 1. They include the [[photon]] which carries the [[electromagnetic force]], the [[gluon]] ([[strong force]]), and the [[W and Z bosons]] ([[weak force]]). The ability of bosons to occupy the same quantum state is used in the [[laser]], which aligns many photons having the same quantum number (the same direction and frequency), [[superfluid]] [[liquid helium]] resulting from helium-4 atoms being bosons, and [[superconductivity]] where [[Cooper pair|pairs of electrons]] (which individually are fermions) act as single composite bosons.
:Elementary bosons with other spins (0, 2, 3 etc.) were not historically known to exist, although they have received considerable theoretical treatment and are well established within their respective mainstream theories. In particular theoreticians have proposed the [[graviton]] (predicted to exist by some [[quantum gravity]] theories) with spin 2, and the [[Higgs boson]] (explaining [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]) with spin 0. Since 2013 the Higgs boson with spin 0 has been considered proven to exist. It is the first [[scalar boson|scalar particle]] (spin 0) known to exist in nature.

Theoretical and experimental studies have shown{{Cn|date=October 2015}} that the spin possessed by [[elementary particle]]s cannot be explained by postulating that they are made up of even smaller particles rotating about a common [[center of mass]] analogous to a [[classical electron radius]]; as far as can be presently determined, these elementary particles have no inner structure. The spin of an elementary particle is therefore seen as a truly intrinsic physical property, akin to the particle's [[electric charge]] and [[rest mass]].

===Spin-statistics theorem===
The proof that particles with half-integer spin (fermions) obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] and the Pauli Exclusion Principle, and particles with integer spin (bosons) obey Bose–Einstein statistics, occupy &quot;symmetric states&quot;, and thus can share quantum states, is known as the [[spin-statistics theorem]]. The theorem relies on both quantum mechanics and the theory of [[special relativity]], and this connection between spin and statistics has been called &quot;one of the most important applications of the special relativity theory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pauli | first1 = Wolfgang | authorlink = Wolfgang Pauli | year = 1940 | title = The Connection Between Spin and Statistics | url = http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/pauli40b/eng.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Phys.

==Magnetic moments==

{{main|Spin magnetic moment}}

[[File:Neutron spin dipole field.jpg|thumbnail|right|Schematic diagram depicting the spin of the neutron as the black arrow and magnetic field lines associated with the [[neutron magnetic moment]].  The neutron has a negative magnetic moment.  While the spin of the neutron is upward in this diagram, the magnetic field lines at the center of the dipole are downward.]]
Particles with spin can possess a [[magnetic dipole moment]], just like a rotating [[electric charge|electrically charged]] body in [[classical electrodynamics]]. These magnetic moments can be experimentally observed in several ways, e.g. by the deflection of particles by inhomogeneous [[magnetic field]]s in a [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]], or by measuring the magnetic fields generated by the particles themselves.

where the [[dimensionless quantity]] ''g&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called the spin [[g-factor (physics)#Electron spin g-factor|g-factor]]. For exclusively orbital rotations it would be 1 (assuming that the mass and the charge occupy spheres of equal radius).

The electron, being a charged elementary particle, possesses a [[Electron magnetic moment|nonzero magnetic moment]]. One of the triumphs of the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]] is its accurate prediction of the electron [[Landé g-factor|''g''-factor]], which has been experimentally determined to have the value {{val|-2.0023193043622|(15)}}, with the digits in parentheses denoting [[measurement uncertainty]] in the last two digits at one [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref&gt;

:&quot;After some years, it was discovered that this value [−''g''/2] was not exactly 1, but slightly more—something like 1.00116. This correction was worked out for the first time in 1948 by Schwinger as ''j''*''j'' divided by 2 pi {{sic}} [where ''j'' is the square root of the [[fine-structure constant]]], and was due to an alternative way the electron can go from place to place: instead of going directly from one point to another, the electron goes along for a while and suddenly emits a photon; then (horrors!) it absorbs its own photon.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Composite particles also possess magnetic moments associated with their spin. In particular, the [[neutron]] possesses a non-zero magnetic moment despite being electrically neutral. This fact was an early indication that the neutron is not an elementary particle. In fact, it is made up of [[quarks]], which are electrically charged particles. The [[neutron magnetic moment|magnetic moment of the neutron]] comes from the spins of the individual quarks and their orbital motions.

[[Neutrino]]s are both elementary and electrically neutral. The minimally extended [[Standard Model]] that takes into account non-zero neutrino masses predicts neutrino magnetic moments of:&lt;ref&gt;

The measurement of neutrino magnetic moments is an active area of research. {{As of|2001}}, the latest experimental results have put the neutrino magnetic moment at less than {{val|1.2|e=-10}} times the electron's magnetic moment.

In ordinary materials, the magnetic dipole moments of individual atoms produce magnetic fields that cancel one another, because each dipole points in a random direction. [[Ferromagnet]]ic materials below their [[Curie temperature]], however, exhibit [[magnetic domain]]s in which the atomic dipole moments are locally aligned, producing a macroscopic, non-zero magnetic field from the domain. These are the ordinary &quot;magnets&quot; with which we are all familiar.

In paramagnetic materials, the magnetic dipole moments of individual atoms spontaneously align with an externally applied magnetic field.  In diamagnetic materials, on the other hand, the magnetic dipole moments of individual atoms spontaneously align oppositely to any externally applied magnetic field, even if it requires energy to do so.

The study of the behavior of such &quot;[[spin model]]s&quot; is a thriving area of research in [[condensed matter physics]]. For instance, the [[Ising model]] describes spins (dipoles) that have only two possible states, up and down, whereas in the [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg model]] the spin vector is allowed to point in any direction. These models have many interesting properties, which have led to interesting results in the theory of [[phase transition]]s.

==Direction==
{{further|Angular momentum operator}}

===Spin projection quantum number and multiplicity===
In classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle possesses not only a magnitude (how fast the body is rotating), but also a direction (either up or down on the [[axis of rotation]] of the particle). Quantum mechanical spin also contains information about direction, but in a more subtle form. Quantum mechanics states that the [[Spatial vector|component]] of angular momentum measured along any direction can only take on the values &lt;ref&gt;Quanta: A handbook of concepts, P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1974, ISBN 0-19-855493-1&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; S_i = \hbar s_i, \quad s_i \in \{ - s, -(s-1), \dots, s-1, s \} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the spin component along the ''i''-axis (either ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''), ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the spin projection quantum number along the ''i''-axis, and ''s'' is the principal spin quantum number (discussed in the previous section). Conventionally the direction chosen is the ''z''-axis:

:&lt;math&gt; S_z = \hbar s_z, \quad s_z \in \{ - s, -(s-1), \dots, s - 1, s \} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the spin component along the ''z''-axis, ''s&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the spin projection quantum number along the ''z''-axis.

One can see that there are 2''s''+1 possible values of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. The number &quot;2''s''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&quot; is the multiplicity of the spin system. For example, there are only two possible values for a [[spin-1/2]] particle: ''s''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2 and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1/2. These correspond to [[quantum state]]s in which the spin is pointing in the +z or &amp;minus;z directions respectively, and are often referred to as &quot;spin up&quot; and &quot;spin down&quot;. For a spin-3/2 particle, like a [[delta baryon]], the possible values are +3/2, +1/2, &amp;minus;1/2, &amp;minus;3/2.

===Vector===
[[File:Spin One-Half (Slow).gif|thumb|A single point in space can spin continuously without becoming tangled. Notice that after a 360 degree rotation, the spiral flips between clockwise and counterclockwise orientations.  It returns to its original configuration after spinning a full 720 degrees.]]

For a given [[quantum state]], one could think of a spin vector &lt;math&gt;\lang S \rang &lt;/math&gt; whose components are the [[expectation value (quantum physics)|expectation value]]s of the spin components along each axis, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\lang S \rang = [\lang S_x \rang, \lang S_y \rang, \lang S_z \rang]&lt;/math&gt;. This vector then would describe the &quot;direction&quot; in which the spin is pointing, corresponding to the classical concept of the [[axis of rotation]]. It turns out that the spin vector is not very useful in actual quantum mechanical calculations, because it cannot be measured directly: ''s&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''s&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''s&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' cannot possess simultaneous definite values, because of a quantum [[uncertainty principle|uncertainty relation]] between them. However, for statistically large collections of particles that have been placed in the same pure quantum state, such as through the use of a [[Stern–Gerlach apparatus]], the spin vector does have a well-defined experimental meaning: It specifies the direction in ordinary space in which a subsequent detector must be oriented in order to achieve the maximum possible probability (100%) of detecting every particle in the collection. For spin-1/2 particles, this maximum probability drops off smoothly as the angle between the spin vector and the detector increases, until at an angle of 180 degrees—that is, for detectors oriented in the opposite direction to the spin vector—the expectation of detecting particles from the collection reaches a minimum of 0%.

As a qualitative concept, the spin vector is often handy because it is easy to picture classically. For instance, quantum mechanical spin can exhibit phenomena analogous to classical [[gyroscope|gyroscopic effects]]. For example, one can exert a kind of &quot;[[torque]]&quot; on an electron by putting it in a [[magnetic field]] (the field acts upon the electron's intrinsic [[magnetic dipole moment]]&amp;mdash;see the following section). The result is that the spin vector undergoes [[precession]], just like a classical gyroscope.  This phenomenon is known as [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|electron spin resonance (ESR)]]. The equivalent behaviour of protons in atomic nuclei is used in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance| nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)]] spectroscopy and imaging.

Mathematically, quantum mechanical spin states are described by vector-like objects known as [[spinor]]s. There are subtle differences between the behavior of spinors and vectors under [[coordinate rotation]]s. For example, rotating a spin-1/2 particle by 360 degrees does not bring it back to the same quantum state, but to the state with the opposite quantum [[phase (waves)|phase]]; this is detectable, in principle, with [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] experiments. To return the particle to its exact original state, one needs a 720 degree rotation.  (The [[Plate trick]] and [[Mobius strip]] give non-quantum  analogies.)   A spin-zero particle can only have a single quantum state, even after torque is applied. Rotating a spin-2 particle 180 degrees can bring it back to the same quantum state and a spin-4 particle should be rotated 90 degrees to bring it back to the same quantum state. The spin 2 particle can be analogous to a straight stick that looks the same even after it is rotated 180 degrees and a spin 0 particle can be imagined as sphere which looks the same after whatever angle it is turned through.

==Mathematical formulation==

===Operator===
Spin obeys [[commutation relations]] analogous to those of the [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]]:

:&lt;math&gt;[S_i, S_j ] = i \hbar \epsilon_{ijk} S_k&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]]. It follows (as with [[angular momentum]]) that the [[eigenvectors]] of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; (expressed as [[Bra-ket notation|ket]]s in the total ''S'' [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]) are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  S^2 |s,m\rangle &amp;= \hbar^2 s(s + 1) |s,m\rangle \\
  S_z |s,m\rangle &amp;= \hbar m |s,m\rangle.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The spin [[Creation and annihilation operators|raising and lowering operators]] acting on these eigenvectors give:

:&lt;math&gt;S_\pm |s,m\rangle = \hbar\sqrt{s(s+1)-m(m\pm 1)} |s,m\pm 1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S_\pm = S_x \pm i S_y. &lt;/math&gt;

But unlike orbital angular momentum the eigenvectors are not [[spherical harmonics]]. They are not functions of ''&amp;theta;'' and ''&amp;phi;''. There is also no reason to exclude half-integer values of ''s'' and ''m''.

In addition to their other properties, all quantum mechanical particles possess an intrinsic spin (though it may have the intrinsic spin 0, too). The spin is quantized in units of the reduced [[Planck's constant|Planck constant]], such that the state function of the particle is, say, not &lt;math&gt;\psi = \psi(\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\psi =\psi(\mathbf r,\sigma)\, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma &lt;/math&gt; is out of the following discrete set of values:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \in \{-s\hbar, -(s - 1)\hbar, \cdots, +(s - 1)\hbar, +s\hbar\}.&lt;/math&gt;

One distinguishes [[boson]]s (integer spin) and [[fermion]]s (half-integer spin). The total angular momentum conserved in interaction processes is then the ''sum'' of the orbital angular momentum and the spin.

=== Pauli matrices ===

The [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[Operator (mathematics)|operators]] associated with spin-&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; [[observables]] are:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{S}}=\frac{\hbar}{2}\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

where in Cartesian components:

:&lt;math&gt; S_x = {\hbar \over 2} \sigma_x,\quad S_y = {\hbar \over 2} \sigma_y,\quad S_z = {\hbar \over 2} \sigma_z \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For the special case of spin-1/2 particles, ''σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''σ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''σ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the three [[Pauli matrices]], given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_x =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\, \quad
\sigma_y =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -i\\
i &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix} \, \quad
\sigma_z =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Pauli exclusion principle===

For systems of ''N'' identical particles this is related to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which states that by interchanges of any two of the ''N'' particles one must have

:&lt;math&gt;\psi ( \cdots \mathbf r_i,\sigma_i\cdots \mathbf r_j,\sigma_j\cdots ) = (-1)^{2s}\psi ( \cdots \mathbf r_j,\sigma_j\cdots \mathbf r_i,\sigma_i\cdots ) .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for bosons the prefactor (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;2''s''&lt;/sup&gt; will reduce to +1, for fermions to &amp;minus;1. In quantum mechanics all particles are either bosons or fermions. In some speculative relativistic quantum field theories &quot;[[Supersymmetry|supersymmetric]]&quot; particles also exist, where linear combinations of bosonic and fermionic components appear. In two dimensions, the prefactor (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;2''s''&lt;/sup&gt; can be replaced by any complex number of magnitude 1 such as in the [[Anyon]].
 
The above permutation postulate for ''N''-particle state functions has most-important consequences in daily life, e.g. the [[periodic table]] of the chemists or biologists.

===Rotations===

{{see also|symmetries in quantum mechanics}}

As described above, quantum mechanics states that [[Spatial vector|components]] of angular momentum measured along any direction can only take a number of discrete values. The most convenient quantum mechanical description of particle's spin is therefore with a set of complex numbers corresponding to amplitudes of finding a given value of projection of its intrinsic angular momentum on a given axis. For instance, for a spin 1/2 particle, we would need two numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;±1/2&lt;/sub&gt;, giving amplitudes of finding it with projection of angular momentum equal to ''ħ''/2 and &amp;minus;''ħ''/2, satisfying the requirement

:&lt;math&gt;\left|a_\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 + \left|a_{-\frac{1}{2}}\right|^2 \, = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

For a generic particle with spin ''s'', we would need 2''s'' + 1 such parameters. Since these numbers depend on the choice of the axis, they transform into each other non-trivially when this axis is rotated. It's clear that the transformation law must be linear, so we can represent it by associating a matrix with each rotation, and the product of two transformation matrices corresponding to rotations A and B must be equal (up to phase) to the matrix representing rotation AB. Further, rotations preserve the quantum mechanical inner product, and so should our transformation matrices:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{m=-j}^{j} a_m^* b_m = \sum_{m=-j}^{j} \left(\sum_{n=-j}^j U_{nm} a_n\right)^* \left(\sum_{k=-j}^j U_{km} b_k\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=-j}^j \sum_{k=-j}^j U_{np}^* U_{kq} = \delta_{pq}.&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematically speaking, these matrices furnish a unitary [[projective representation|projective]] [[group representation|representation]] of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. Each such representation corresponds to a representation of the covering group of SO(3), which is [[SU(2)]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is one ''n''-dimensional irreducible representation of SU(2) for each dimension, though this representation is ''n''-dimensional real for odd ''n'' and ''n''-dimensional complex for even ''n'' (hence of real dimension 2''n''). For a rotation by angle ''θ'' in the plane with normal vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;, ''U''  can be written

:&lt;math&gt; U = e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar} \boldsymbol{\theta} \cdot \mathbf{S}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta} = \theta \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt; is a and '''S''' is the vector of [[#Spin operator|spin operators]].

Working in the coordinate system where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta} = \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;, we would like to show that ''S''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; are rotated into each other by the angle ''&amp;theta;''. Starting with ''S''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. Using units where ''ħ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  S_x \rightarrow U^\dagger S_x U &amp;{}= e^{i \theta S_z} S_x e^{-i \theta S_z} \\
                                  &amp;{} = S_x + (i \theta) [S_z, S_x] + \left(\frac{1}{2!}\right) (i \theta)^2 [S_z, [S_z, S_x]] + \left(\frac{1}{3!}\right) (i \theta)^3 [S_z, [S_z, [S_z, S_x]]] + \cdots\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[#Spin operator|spin operator commutation relations]], we see that the commutators evaluate to i''S''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; for the odd terms in the series, and to ''S''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; for all of the even terms. Thus:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  U^\dagger S_x U &amp;{}= S_x \left[ 1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2!} + ... \right] - S_y \left[ \theta - \frac{\theta^3}{3!} \cdots \right] \\
                  &amp;{} = S_x \cos\theta - S_y \sin\theta\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

as expected. Note that since we only relied on the spin operator commutation relations, this proof holds for any dimension (i.e., for any principal spin quantum number ''s'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=w2a8QgAACAAJ ''Modern Quantum Mechanics'', by J. J. Sakurai, p159]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A generic rotation in 3-dimensional space can be built by compounding operators of this type using [[Euler angles]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{R}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) = e^{-i\alpha S_x}e^{-i\beta S_y}e^{-i\gamma S_z}&lt;/math&gt;
An irreducible representation of this group of operators is furnished by the [[Wigner D-matrix]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
  D^s_{m'm}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) \equiv
  \langle sm' | \mathcal{R}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)| sm \rangle =
  e^{-im'\alpha} d^s_{m'm}(\beta)e^{-i m\gamma},
&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;d^s_{m'm}(\beta)= \langle sm' |e^{-i\beta s_y} | sm \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

is [[Wigner D-matrix#Wigner (small) d-matrix|Wigner's small d-matrix]]. Note that for γ = 2π and α = β = 0; i.e., a full rotation about the z-axis, the Wigner D-matrix elements become
:&lt;math&gt; D^s_{m'm}(0,0,2\pi) = d^s_{m'm}(0) e^{-i m 2 \pi} = \delta_{m'm} (-1)^{2m}.&lt;/math&gt;

Recalling that a generic spin state can be written as a superposition of states with definite ''m'', we see that if ''s'' is an integer, the values of ''m'' are all integers, and this matrix corresponds to the identity operator. However, if ''s'' is a half-integer, the values of ''m'' are also all half-integers, giving (−1)&lt;sup&gt;2''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = −1 for all ''m'', and hence upon rotation by 2π the state picks up a minus sign. This fact is a crucial element of the proof of the [[spin-statistics theorem]].

===Lorentz transformations===
We could try the same approach to determine the behavior of spin under general [[Lorentz transformation]]s, but we would immediately discover a major obstacle. Unlike SO(3), the group of Lorentz transformations [[SO(3,1)]] is [[Compact group|non-compact]] and therefore does not have any faithful, unitary, finite-dimensional representations.

In case of spin 1/2 particles, it is possible to find a construction that includes both a finite-dimensional representation and a scalar product that is preserved by this representation. We associate a 4-component [[Dirac spinor]] &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; with each particle. These spinors transform under Lorentz transformations according to the law

:&lt;math&gt;\psi' = \exp{\left(\frac{1}{8} \omega_{\mu\nu} [\gamma_{\mu}, \gamma_{\nu}]\right)} \psi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; are [[gamma matrices]] and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is an antisymmetric 4×4 matrix parametrizing the transformation. It can be shown that the scalar product

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|\phi\rangle = \bar{\psi}\phi = \psi^{\dagger}\gamma_0\phi&lt;/math&gt;

is preserved. It is not, however, positive definite, so the representation is not unitary.

===Metrology along the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' axes===
Each of the ([[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]]) Pauli matrices has two [[eigenvalues]], +1 and &amp;minus;1. The corresponding [[Normalisable wavefunction|normalized]] [[eigenvectors]] are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lclc}
\psi_{x+}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\!\!\!\!\! &amp; \begin{pmatrix}{1}\\{1}\end{pmatrix}, &amp; \psi_{x-}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\!\!\!\!\! &amp; \begin{pmatrix}{1}\\{-1}\end{pmatrix}, \\
\psi_{y+}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\!\!\!\!\! &amp; \begin{pmatrix}{1}\\{i}\end{pmatrix}, &amp; \psi_{y-}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\!\!\!\!\! &amp; \begin{pmatrix}{1}\\{-i}\end{pmatrix}, \\
\psi_{z+}=                                          &amp; \begin{pmatrix}{1}\\{0}\end{pmatrix}, &amp; \psi_{z-}=                                          &amp; \begin{pmatrix}{0}\\{1}\end{pmatrix}.
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[Postulates of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates of quantum mechanics]], an experiment designed to measure the electron spin on the ''x'', ''y'' or ''z'' axis can only yield an eigenvalue of the corresponding spin operator (''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') on that axis, i.e. ''ħ''/2 or –''ħ''/2. The [[quantum state]] of a particle (with respect to spin), can be represented by a two component [[spinor]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \psi = \begin{pmatrix} {a+bi}\\{c+di}\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

When the spin of this particle is measured with respect to a given axis (in this example, the ''x''-axis), the probability that its spin will be measured as ''ħ''/2 is just &lt;math&gt;\left\vert \langle \psi_{x+} \vert \psi \rangle \right\vert ^2&lt;/math&gt;. Correspondingly, the probability that its spin will be measured as –''ħ''/2 is just &lt;math&gt;\left\vert \langle \psi_{x-} \vert \psi \rangle \right\vert ^2&lt;/math&gt;. Following the measurement, the spin state of the particle will [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the corresponding eigenstate. As a result, if the particle's spin along a given axis has been measured to have a given eigenvalue, all measurements will yield the same eigenvalue (since &lt;math&gt;\left\vert \langle \psi_{x+} \vert \psi_{x+} \rangle \right\vert ^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, etc), provided that no measurements of the spin are made along other axes.

===Metrology along an arbitrary axis===
The operator to measure spin along an arbitrary axis direction is easily obtained from the Pauli spin matrices. Let ''u'' = (''u&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') be an arbitrary unit vector. Then the operator for spin in this direction is simply 
:&lt;math&gt; S_u = \frac{\hbar}{2}(u_x\sigma_x + u_y\sigma_y + u_z\sigma_z)&lt;/math&gt;.
The operator ''S&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' has eigenvalues of ±''ħ''/2, just like the usual spin matrices. This method of finding the operator for spin in an arbitrary direction generalizes to higher spin states, one takes the dot product of the direction with a vector of the three operators for the three ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' axis directions.

A normalized spinor for spin-1/2 in the (''u&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') direction (which works for all spin states except spin down where it will give 0/0), is:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2+2u_z}}\begin{pmatrix} 1+u_z \\ u_x+iu_y \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The above spinor is obtained in the usual way by diagonalizing the &lt;math&gt;\sigma_u&lt;/math&gt; matrix and finding the eigenstates corresponding to the eigenvalues. In quantum mechanics, vectors are termed &quot;normalized&quot; when multiplied by a normalizing factor, which results in the vector having a length of unity.

=== Compatibility of metrology ===
Since the Pauli matrices do not [[commutativity|commute]], measurements of spin along the different axes are incompatible. This means that if, for example, we know the spin along the ''x''-axis, and we then measure the spin along the ''y''-axis, we have invalidated our previous knowledge of the ''x''-axis spin. This can be seen from the property of the eigenvectors (i.e. eigenstates) of the Pauli matrices that:

:&lt;math&gt; \mid \langle \psi_{x\pm} \mid \psi_{y\pm} \rangle \mid ^ 2 = \mid \langle \psi_{x\pm} \mid \psi_{z\pm} \rangle \mid ^ 2 = \mid \langle \psi_{y\pm} \mid \psi_{z\pm} \rangle \mid ^ 2 = \frac{1}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

So when [[physicist]]s measure the spin of a particle along the ''x''-axis as, for example, ''ħ''/2, the particle's spin state [[wavefunction collapse|collapses]] into the eigenstate &lt;math&gt;\mid \psi_{x+} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. When we then subsequently measure the particle's spin along the y-axis, the spin state will now collapse into either &lt;math&gt;\mid \psi_{y+} \rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mid \psi_{y-} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, each with probability 1/2. Let us say, in our example, that we measure –''ħ''/2. When we now return to measure the particle's spin along the x-axis again, the probabilities that we will measure ''ħ''/2 or –''ħ''/2 are each 1/2 (i.e. they are &lt;math&gt; \mid \langle \psi_{x+} \mid \psi_{y-} \rangle \mid ^ 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mid \langle \psi_{x-} \mid \psi_{y-} \rangle \mid ^ 2 &lt;/math&gt; respectively). This implies that the original measurement of the spin along the x-axis is no longer valid, since the spin along the ''x''-axis will now be measured to have either eigenvalue with equal probability.

===Higher spins===

The spin-1/2 operator {{nowrap|'''S''' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}'''σ'''}} form the [[fundamental representation]] of [[Representation theory of SU(2)|SU(2)]]. By taking [[Kronecker product]]s of this representation with itself repeatedly, one may construct all higher irreducible representations.  That is, the  resulting [[spin operator]]s for higher spin systems in three spatial dimensions, for arbitrarily large ''s'',  can be calculated using this [[spin operator]] and [[Ladder operator#Angular momentum|ladder operators]].

The resulting spin matrices for spin 1 are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  S_x &amp;= \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 &amp;1 &amp;0\\
      1 &amp;0 &amp;1\\
      0 &amp;1 &amp;0
    \end{pmatrix} \, \\
  S_y &amp;= \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 &amp;-i &amp;0\\
      i &amp;0  &amp;-i\\
      0 &amp;i  &amp;0
    \end{pmatrix} \, \\
  S_z &amp;= \hbar
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 &amp;0 &amp;0\\
      0 &amp;0 &amp;0\\
      0 &amp;0 &amp;-1
   \end{pmatrix} \, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for spin {{sfrac|3|2}} they are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  S_x &amp;= \frac\hbar2
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0        &amp;\sqrt{3} &amp;0        &amp;0\\
      \sqrt{3} &amp;0        &amp;2        &amp;0\\
      0        &amp;2        &amp;0        &amp;\sqrt{3}\\
      0        &amp;0        &amp;\sqrt{3} &amp;0
    \end{pmatrix} \, \\
  S_y &amp;= \frac\hbar2
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0         &amp;-i\sqrt{3} &amp;0         &amp;0\\
      i\sqrt{3} &amp;0          &amp;-2i       &amp;0\\
      0         &amp;2i         &amp;0         &amp;-i\sqrt{3}\\
      0         &amp;0          &amp;i\sqrt{3} &amp;0
    \end{pmatrix} \, \\
  S_z &amp;= \frac\hbar2
    \begin{pmatrix}
      3 &amp;0 &amp;0  &amp;0\\
      0 &amp;1 &amp;0  &amp;0\\
      0 &amp;0 &amp;-1 &amp;0\\
      0 &amp;0 &amp;0  &amp;-3
     \end{pmatrix} \, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and for spin {{sfrac|5|2}} they are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  S_x &amp;= \frac\hbar2
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0        &amp;\sqrt{5}  &amp;0         &amp;0         &amp;0         &amp;0 \\

      0        &amp;0         &amp;0         &amp;0         &amp;\sqrt{5}  &amp;0

  S_y &amp;= \frac\hbar2
    \begin{pmatrix}

      i\sqrt{5} &amp;0          &amp;-2i\sqrt{2} &amp;0          &amp;0           &amp;0 \\
      0         &amp;2i\sqrt{2} &amp;0           &amp;-3i        &amp;0           &amp;0 \\
      0         &amp;0          &amp;3i          &amp;0          &amp;-2i\sqrt{2} &amp;0 \\
      0         &amp;0          &amp;0           &amp;2i\sqrt{2} &amp;0           &amp;-i\sqrt{5} \\
      0         &amp;0          &amp;0           &amp;0          &amp;i\sqrt{5}   &amp;0
    \end{pmatrix} \, \\
  S_z &amp;= \frac\hbar2
    \begin{pmatrix}
      5 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;0  &amp;0  &amp;0 \\
      0 &amp;3 &amp;0 &amp;0  &amp;0  &amp;0 \\
      0 &amp;0 &amp;1 &amp;0  &amp;0  &amp;0 \\
      0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;-1 &amp;0  &amp;0 \\
      0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;0  &amp;-3 &amp;0 \\
      0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp;0  &amp;0  &amp;-5
    \end{pmatrix} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
 
The generalization of these matrices for arbitrary ''s'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
\left(S_x\right)_{ab} &amp; = \frac{\hbar}{2}(\delta_{a,b+1}+\delta_{a+1,b}  ) \sqrt{(s+1)(a+b-1)-ab} \, \\
\left(S_y\right)_{ab} &amp; = \frac{\hbar}{2i}(\delta_{a,b+1}-\delta_{a+1,b}  ) \sqrt{(s+1)(a+b-1)-ab} \, \quad 1 \le a, b \le 2s+1 \, \\
\left(S_z\right)_{ab} &amp; = \hbar (s+1-a) \delta_{a,b} =\hbar (s+1-b) \delta_{a,b} \,.

Also useful in the [[quantum mechanics]] of multiparticle systems, the general [[Pauli group]] ''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined to consist of all ''n''-fold [[tensor]] products of Pauli matrices.

The analog formula of [[Pauli matrices#Exponential of a Pauli vector|Euler's formula in terms of the Pauli matrices]]:

== Parity ==
In tables of the spin quantum number ''s'' for nuclei or particles, the spin is often followed by a &quot;+&quot; or &quot;−&quot;. This refers to the [[Parity (physics)|parity]] with &quot;+&quot; for even parity (wave function unchanged by spatial inversion) and &quot;−&quot; for odd parity (wave function negated by spatial inversion). For example, see the [[isotopes of bismuth]].

== Applications ==
Spin has important theoretical implications and practical applications. Well-established ''direct'' applications of spin include:
* [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy in chemistry;
* [[Electron spin resonance]] spectroscopy in chemistry and physics;
* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) in medicine, a type of applied NMR, which relies on proton spin density;
* [[Giant magnetoresistive effect|Giant magnetoresistive]] (GMR) drive head technology in modern [[hard disk]]s.

Electron spin plays an important role in [[magnetism]], with applications for instance in computer memories. The manipulation of ''nuclear spin'' by radiofrequency waves ([[nuclear magnetic resonance]]) is important in chemical spectroscopy and medical imaging.

[[Spin-orbit coupling]] leads to the [[fine structure]] of atomic spectra, which is used in [[atomic clock]]s and in the modern definition of the [[second]]. Precise measurements of the g-factor of the electron have played an important role in the development and verification of [[quantum electrodynamics]]. ''Photon spin'' is associated with the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of light.

An emerging application of spin is as a binary information carrier in [[spin transistor]]s. The original concept, proposed in 1990, is known as Datta-Das spin transistor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi =  10.1063/1.102730| author =  Datta. S and B. Das |title = Electronic analog of the electrooptic modulator|journal = Applied Physics Letters| volume = 56| pages = 665–667|year = 1990| issue =  7|bibcode = 1990ApPhL..56..665D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronics based on spin transistors are referred to as [[spintronics]]. The manipulation of spin in [[ZnO-based diluted magnetic semiconductors|dilute magnetic semiconductor materials]], such as metal-doped [[zinc oxide|ZnO]] or [[titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]  imparts a further degree of freedom and has the potential to facilitate the fabrication of more efficient electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Assadi| first1=M.H.N| last2=Hanaor| first2=D.A.H| title= Theoretical study on copper's energetics and magnetism in TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; polymorphs| journal= Journal of Applied Physics | year=2013| volume=113| issue=23| pages= 233913|url=http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1304/1304.1854.pdf| doi=10.1063/1.4811539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ''indirect'' applications and manifestations of spin and the associated [[Pauli exclusion principle]], starting with the [[periodic table]] of chemistry.

==History==
Spin was first discovered in the context of the [[emission spectrum]] of [[alkali metal]]s. In 1924 [[Wolfgang Ernst Pauli|Wolfgang Pauli]] introduced what he called a &quot;two-valued quantum degree of freedom&quot; associated with the electron in the outermost [[electron shell|shell]]. This allowed him to formulate the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], stating that no two electrons can share the same [[quantum state]] at the same time.
[[File:Wolfgang Pauli young.jpg|thumb|Wolfgang Pauli]]
The physical interpretation of Pauli's &quot;degree of freedom&quot; was initially unknown. [[Ralph Kronig]], one of [[Alfred Landé|Landé]]'s assistants, suggested in early 1925 that it was produced by the self-rotation of the electron. When Pauli heard about the idea, he criticized it severely, noting that the electron's hypothetical surface would have to be moving faster than the [[speed of light]] in order for it to rotate quickly enough to produce the necessary angular momentum. This would violate the [[theory of relativity]]. Largely due to Pauli's criticism, Kronig decided not to publish his idea.

In the autumn of 1925, the same thought came to two Dutch physicists, [[George Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] at [[Leiden University]]. Under the advice of [[Paul Ehrenfest]], they published their results. It met a favorable response, especially after [[Llewellyn Thomas]] managed to resolve a factor-of-two discrepancy between experimental results and Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit's calculations (and Kronig's unpublished results). This discrepancy was due to the orientation of the electron's tangent frame, in addition to its position.

Mathematically speaking, a [[fiber bundle]] description is needed. The [[tangent bundle]] effect is additive and relativistic; that is, it vanishes if ''c'' goes to infinity. It is one half of the value obtained without regard for the tangent space orientation, but with opposite sign. Thus the combined effect differs from the latter by a factor two ([[Thomas precession]]).

Despite his initial objections, Pauli formalized the theory of spin in 1927, using the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]] invented by [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]] and [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]. He pioneered the use of [[Pauli matrices]] as a [[group representation|representation]] of the spin operators, and introduced a two-component [[spinor]] wave-function.

Pauli's theory of spin was non-relativistic. However, in 1928, [[Paul Dirac]] published the [[Dirac equation]], which described the relativistic [[electron]]. In the Dirac equation, a four-component spinor (known as a &quot;[[Dirac spinor]]&quot;) was used for the electron wave-function. In 1940, Pauli proved the ''[[spin-statistics theorem]]'', which states that [[fermion]]s have half-integer spin and [[boson]]s integer spin.

In retrospect, the first direct experimental evidence of the electron spin was the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]] of 1922. However, the correct explanation of this experiment was only given in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A '''magnetic field''' is the magnetic effect of [[electric current]]s and [[magnet|magnetic materials]]. The magnetic field at any given point is specified by both a ''direction'' and a ''magnitude'' (or strength); as such it is a [[vector field]].&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Strictly speaking, a magnetic field is a [[pseudo vector]]; pseudo-vectors, which also include torque and [[Rotational speed|rotational velocity]], are similar to vectors except that they remain unchanged when the coordinates are inverted.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used for two distinct but closely related fields denoted by the symbols {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}}, where {{math|'''H'''}} is measured in units of [[ampere]]s per [[meter]] (symbol: A&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or A/m) in the [[International System of Units|SI]]. {{math|'''B'''}} is measured in [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]]s (symbol:T) and [[newton (unit)|newton]]s per [[meter]] per [[ampere]] (symbol: N&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;A&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or N/(m&amp;middot;A)) in the [[International System of Units|SI]]. {{math|'''B'''}} is most commonly defined in terms of the [[Lorentz force]] it exerts on moving electric charges.

Magnetic fields can be produced by moving [[electric charge]]s and the intrinsic magnetic moments of [[elementary particle]]s associated with a fundamental [[quantum mechanics|quantum property]], their [[Spin (physics)|spin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jiles&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[special relativity]], electric and magnetic fields are two interrelated aspects of a single object, called the [[electromagnetic tensor]]; the split of this tensor into electric and magnetic fields depends on the relative velocity of the observer and charge. In quantum physics, the electromagnetic field is quantized and electromagnetic interactions result from the exchange of [[photon]]s.

In everyday life, magnetic fields are most often encountered as a [[force]] created by [[permanent magnet]]s, which pull on ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt, or nickel, and attract or repel other magnets. Magnetic fields are widely used throughout modern technology, particularly in [[electrical engineering]] and [[electromechanics]]. The Earth produces [[Earth's magnetic field|its own magnetic field]], which is important in navigation, and it shields the Earth's atmosphere from [[solar wind]]. Rotating magnetic fields are used in both [[electric motor]]s and [[electric generator|generators]]. Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the [[Hall effect]]. The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is studied in the discipline of [[magnetic circuit]]s.

==History==
{{Main|History of electromagnetic theory}}
[[Image:Descartes magnetic field.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the first drawings of a magnetic field, by [[René Descartes]], 1644. It illustrated his theory that magnetism was caused by the circulation of tiny helical particles, &quot;threaded parts&quot;, through threaded pores in magnets.]]
Although magnets and magnetism were known much earlier, the study of magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar [[Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt]] mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;His ''Epistola Petri Peregrini de Maricourt ad Sygerum de Foucaucourt Militem de Magnete'', which is often shortened to ''Epistola de magnete'', is dated 1269 C.E.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points 'poles' in analogy to Earth's poles. He also clearly articulated the principle that magnets always have both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.

Almost three centuries later, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] of Colchester replicated Petrus Peregrinus' work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is a magnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1600, Gilbert's work, ''[[De Magnete]]'', helped to establish magnetism as a science.

In 1750, [[John Michell]] stated that magnetic poles attract and repel in accordance with an [[inverse square law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] experimentally verified this in 1785 and stated explicitly that the north and south poles cannot be separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on this force between poles, [[Siméon Denis Poisson]] (1781–1840) created the first successful model of the magnetic field, which he presented in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, a magnetic {{math|'''H'''}}-field is produced by 'magnetic poles' and magnetism is due to small pairs of north/south magnetic poles.

[[File:Ørsted - ger, 1854 - 682714 F.tif|thumb|[[Hans Christian Ørsted]], ''Der Geist in der Natur'', 1854]]
Three discoveries challenged this foundation of magnetism, though. First, in 1819, [[Hans Christian Oersted]] discovered that an electric current generates a magnetic field encircling it. Then in 1820, [[André-Marie Ampère]] showed that parallel wires having currents in the same direction attract one another. Finally, [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] and [[Félix Savart]] discovered the [[Biot–Savart law]] in 1820, which correctly predicts the magnetic field around any current-carrying wire.

Extending these experiments, Ampère published his own successful model of magnetism in 1825. In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;

From the outside, the field of a dipole of magnetic charge has exactly the same form as a current loop when both are sufficiently small. Therefore, the two models differ only for magnetism inside magnetic material.&lt;/ref&gt; This has the additional benefit of explaining why magnetic charge can not be isolated. Further, Ampère derived both [[Ampère's force law]] describing the force between two currents and [[Ampère's law]], which, like the Biot–Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Ampère introduced the term [[electrodynamics]] to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.

In 1831, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered electromagnetic induction when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field. He described this phenomenon in what is known as [[Faraday's law of induction]]. Later, [[Franz Ernst Neumann]] proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Ampère's force law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process he introduced the [[magnetic vector potential]], which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.

In 1850, [[Lord Kelvin]], then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}. The former applied to Poisson's model and the latter to Ampère's model and induction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he derived how {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} relate to each other.

The reason {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} are used for the two magnetic fields has been a source of some debate among science historians. Most agree that Kelvin avoided {{math|'''M'''}} to prevent confusion with the SI fundamental unit of length, the [[Metre]], abbreviated &quot;m.&quot; However, some believe that Kelvin chose {{math|'''H'''}} to honor his mentor [[Humphry Davy]] and chose {{math|'''B'''}} because he and his wife never had children, and Kelvin strongly desired that his wife have a baby, and the word &quot;baby&quot; begins with &quot;B.&quot; Others believe the choices were purely random.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin (1900). &quot;Kabinett physikalischer Raritäten.&quot; Page 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/did/Schulservice/Physikerkalender/06_26_Lord-Kelvin-of-Largs.pdf Lord Kelvin of Largs]. physik.uni-augsburg.de. 26 June 1824&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1861 and 1865, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed and published [[Maxwell's equations]], which explained and united all of [[classical theory|classical]] electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled ''[[:Commons:File:On Physical Lines of Force.pdf|On Physical Lines of Force]]'' in 1861. These equations were valid although incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]'' and demonstrated the fact that light is an [[electromagnetic wave]]. [[Heinrich Hertz]] experimentally confirmed this fact in 1887.

The twentieth century extended electrodynamics to include relativity and quantum mechanics. [[Albert Einstein]], in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. (See [[moving magnet and conductor problem]] for details about the [[thought experiment]] that eventually helped Albert Einstein to develop [[special relativity]].) Finally, the emergent field of [[quantum mechanics]] was merged with electrodynamics to form [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).

The magnetic field can be defined in several equivalent ways based on the effects it has on its environment.

Often the magnetic field is defined by the force it exerts on a moving charged particle. It is known from experiments in [[electrostatics]] that a particle of charge {{math|''q''}} in an electric field {{math|'''E'''}} experiences a force {{math|1='''F''' = ''q'''''E'''}}. However, in other situations, such as when a charged particle moves in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire, the force also depends on the velocity of that particle. Fortunately, the velocity dependent portion can be separated out such that the force on the particle satisfies the ''[[Lorentz force law]]'',
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}).&lt;/math&gt;
Here {{math|'''v'''}} is the particle's velocity and &amp;times; denotes the [[cross product]]. The vector {{math|'''B'''}} is termed the magnetic field, and it is ''defined'' as the vector field necessary to make the Lorentz force law correctly describe the motion of a charged particle. This definition allows the determination of {{math|'''B'''}} in the following way&lt;ref name=&quot;purcell&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Purcell, E.|title=Electricity and Magnetism|pages=173&amp;ndash;4|year=2011|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1107013607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|[T]he command, &quot;Measure the direction and magnitude of the vector {{math|'''B'''}} at such and such a place,&quot; calls for the following operations: Take a particle of known charge {{math|''q''}}. Measure the force on {{math|''q''}} at rest, to determine {{math|'''E'''}}. Then measure the force on the particle when its velocity is {{math|'''v'''}}; repeat with {{math|'''v'''}} in some other direction. Now find a {{math|'''B'''}} that makes [the Lorentz force law] fit all these results—that is the magnetic field at the place in question.}}

Alternatively, the magnetic field can be defined in terms of the [[torque]] it produces on a magnetic dipole (see [[#Magnetic torque on permanent magnets|magnetic torque on permanent magnets]] below).

=== The H-field ===

In addition to {{math|'''B'''}}, there is a quantity {{math|'''H'''}}, which is also sometimes called the ''magnetic field''.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The letters B and H were originally chosen by Maxwell in his ''[[Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' (Vol. II, pp. 236&amp;ndash;237). For many quantities, he simply started choosing letters from the beginning of the alphabet. See {{cite journal|author=Ralph Baierlein|title=Answer to Question #73. S is for entropy, Q is for charge|journal=American Journal of Physics|year=2000|volume=68|issue=8|pages=691|doi=10.1119/1.19524|bibcode = 2000AmJPh..68..691B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a vacuum, {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} are proportional to each other, with the multiplicative constant depending on the physical units. Inside a material they are different (see [[#H-field_and_magnetic_materials|H and B inside and outside of magnetic materials]]). The term &quot;magnetic field&quot; is historically reserved for {{math|'''H'''}} while using other terms for {{math|'''B'''}}. Informally, though, and formally for some recent textbooks mostly in physics, the term 'magnetic field' is used to describe {{math|'''B'''}} as well as or in place of {{math|'''H'''}}.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex03&quot;&gt;[[Edward Mills Purcell|Edward Purcell]], in Electricity and Magnetism, McGraw-Hill, 1963, writes, ''Even some modern writers who treat {{math|'''B'''}} as the primary field feel obliged to call it the magnetic induction because the name magnetic field was historically preempted by {{math|'''H'''}}. This seems clumsy and pedantic. If you go into the laboratory and ask a physicist what causes the pion trajectories in his bubble chamber to curve, he'll probably answer &quot;magnetic field&quot;, not &quot;magnetic induction.&quot; You will seldom hear a geophysicist refer to the Earth's magnetic induction, or an astrophysicist talk about the magnetic induction of the galaxy. We propose to keep on calling {{math|'''B'''}} the magnetic field. As for {{math|'''H'''}}, although other names have been invented for it, we shall call it &quot;the field {{math|'''H'''}}&quot; or even &quot;the magnetic field {{math|'''H'''}}.&quot;'' In a similar vein, {{cite book |author=M Gerloch |title=Magnetism and Ligand-field Analysis |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Ovo8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA110 |page=110 |isbn=0-521-24939-2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983}} says: &quot;So we may think of both {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} as magnetic fields, but drop the word 'magnetic' from {{math|'''H'''}} so as to maintain the distinction ... As Purcell points out, 'it is only the names that give trouble, not the symbols'.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
There are many alternative names for both (see sidebar).

===Units===
In [[SI]] units, {{math|'''B'''}} is measured in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]] (symbol: T) and correspondingly {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;}} ([[magnetic flux]]) is measured in [[Weber (unit)|webers]] (symbol: Wb) so that a flux density of 1&amp;nbsp;Wb/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 1&amp;nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|tesla]]. The SI unit of tesla is equivalent to ([[newton (unit)|newton]]·[[second]])/([[coulomb (unit)|coulomb]]·[[metre]]).&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;This can be seen from the magnetic part of the Lorentz force law {{math|1=''F'' = ''qvB''sinθ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gaussian units|Gaussian-cgs units]], {{math|'''B'''}} is measured in [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] (symbol: G). (The conversion is 1 T = 10,000 G.) The {{math|'''H'''}}-field is measured in [[ampere]]s per metre (A/m) in SI units, and in [[oersted]]s (Oe) in cgs units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International system of units (SI) |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html |work=NIST reference on constants, units, and uncertainty |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement===
The precision attained for a magnetic field measurement for Gravity Probe B experiment is 5&amp;nbsp;attoteslas ({{val|5|e=-18|u=T}});&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/168808main_gp-b_pfar_cvr-pref-execsum.pdf|title=Gravity Probe B Executive Summary|pages=10, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest magnetic field produced in a laboratory is 2.8&amp;nbsp;kT ([[VNIIEF]] in [[Sarov]], [[Russia]], 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=823621|title=With record magnetic fields to the 21st Century|work=[[IEEE Xplore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic field of some astronomical objects such as [[magnetar]]s are much higher; magnetars range from 0.1 to 100&amp;nbsp;GT (10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;T).&lt;ref&gt;Kouveliotou, C.; Duncan, R. C.; Thompson, C. (February 2003). &quot;[http://solomon.as.utexas.edu/~duncan/sciam.pdf Magnetars]&quot;. ''[[Scientific American]]''; Page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[orders of magnitude (magnetic field)]].

Devices used to measure the local magnetic field are called [[magnetometer]]s. Important classes of magnetometers include using a rotating coil, [[Hall effect]] magnetometers, [[proton magnetometer|NMR magnetometers]], [[SQUID|SQUID magnetometers]], and [[Magnetometer#Fluxgate magnetometer|fluxgate magnetometers]]. The magnetic fields of distant [[astronomical object]]s are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce [[synchrotron radiation]] that is detectable in [[radio waves]].

==Magnetic field lines{{anchor|Magnetic field line}}==
{{Main|Field line}}

[[Image:Magnetic field near pole.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Compass]]es reveal the direction of the local magnetic field. As seen here, the magnetic field points towards a magnet's south pole and away from its north pole.]]
Mapping the magnetic field of an object is simple in principle. First, measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of locations (or at every point in space). Then, mark each location with an arrow (called a [[vector (geometry)|vector]]) pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.

An alternative method to map the magnetic field is to 'connect' the arrows to form magnetic ''field lines''. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength.

Magnetic field lines are like the [[contour line]]s (constant altitude) on a [[topographic map]] in that they represent something continuous, and a different mapping scale would show more or fewer lines. An advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the 'number' of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly 'translated' to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the [[surface integral]] of the magnetic field.

[[Image:Magnet0873.png|thumb|right|The direction of magnetic [[field line]]s represented by the alignment of [[iron filings]] sprinkled on paper placed above a bar magnet.]]

Various phenomena have the effect of &quot;displaying&quot; magnetic field lines as though the field lines are physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field line up to form lines that correspond to 'field lines'.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex07&quot;&gt;The use of iron filings to display a field presents something of an exception to this picture; the filings alter the magnetic field so that it is much larger along the &quot;lines&quot; of iron, due to the large [[magnetic permeability|permeability]] of iron relative to air.&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic fields' &quot;lines&quot; are also visually displayed in [[Aurora (astronomy)|polar auroras]], in which [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.

Field lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In [[ferromagnetic]] substances like [[iron]] and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a [[Maxwell stress tensor|tension]], (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines.  'Unlike' poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; 'like' poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other. The rigorous form of this concept is the [[electromagnetic stress–energy tensor]].

==Magnetic field and permanent magnets==
{{Main|Magnet}}

''Permanent magnets'' are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials, such as iron and [[nickel]], that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole.

===Magnetic field of permanent magnets===
{{Main|Magnetic moment|magnetic moment#Two definitions of moment|l2=Two definitions of moment}}

The magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex05&quot;&gt;Here 'small' means that the observer is sufficiently far away that it can be treated as being infinitesimally small.  'Larger' magnets need to include more complicated terms in the expression and depend on the entire geometry of the magnet not just {{math|'''m'''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; straight magnet is proportional to the magnet's ''strength'' (called its [[magnetic dipole moment]] {{math|'''m'''}}). The [[Dipole#Field of a static magnetic dipole|equations]] are non-trivial and also depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, {{math|'''m'''}} points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its {{math|'''m'''}} by 180 degrees.

The magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modelling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called [[dipole]]s each having their own {{math|'''m'''}}. The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles. And, any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles.

There are two competing models for the nature of these dipoles. These two models produce two different magnetic fields, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}. Outside a material, though, the two are identical (to a multiplicative constant) so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials.

===Magnetic pole model and the H-field===
[[Image:VFPt dipole electric.svg|thumb|200px|upright|The magnetic pole model: two opposing poles, North (+) and South (−), separated by a distance d produce an {{math|'''H'''}}-field (lines).]]
It is sometimes useful to model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the [[Coulomb force]] between electric charges. This is called the Gilbert model of magnetism, after [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]. In this model, a magnetic {{math|'''H'''}}-field is produced by ''magnetic charges'' that are 'smeared' around each pole. 
These ''magnetic charges'' are in fact related to the magnetization field 
{{math|'''M'''}}.

The {{math|'''H'''}}-field, therefore, is analogous to the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}}, which starts at a positive [[electric charge]] and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all {{math|'''H'''}}-field lines point away from the north pole (whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole (whether inside the magnet or out) all {{math|'''H'''}}-field lines point toward the south pole. A north pole, then, feels a force in the direction of the {{math|'''H'''}}-field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the {{math|'''H'''}}-field.

In the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole {{math|'''m'''}} is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength {{math|''q''{{sub|m}}}} separated by a small distance vector {{math|'''d'''}}, such that {{math|1='''m''' = ''q''{{sub|m}}&amp;thinsp;'''d'''}}. The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field {{math|'''H'''}} both inside and outside 
magnetic materials, in particular the fact that  {{math|'''H'''}} is opposite to the 
magnetization field {{math|'''M'''}} inside a permanent magnet.

Since it is based on the fictitious idea of a ''magnetic charge density'', the Gilbert model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north/south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents.

===Amperian loop model and the B-field===
{{see also|Gauss's law for magnetism}}

[[Image:VFPt dipole magnetic3.svg|thumbnail|200px|right|The Amperian loop model: A current loop (ring) that goes into the page at the x and comes out at the dot produces a {{math|'''B'''}}-field (lines). The north pole is to the right and the south to the left.]]

After Oersted discovered that electric currents produce a magnetic field and Ampere discovered that electric currents attracted and repelled each other similar to magnets, it was natural to hypothesize that all magnetic fields are due to electric current loops. In this model developed by Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this loop is {{math|1=''m'' = ''IA''}} where {{math|''A''}} is the area of the loop.

These magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic {{math|'''B'''}}-field. One important property of the {{math|'''B'''}}-field produced this way is that magnetic {{math|'''B'''}}-field lines neither start nor end (mathematically, {{math|'''B'''}} is a [[solenoidal vector field]]); a field line either extends to infinity or wraps around to form a closed curve.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Magnetic field lines may also wrap around and around without closing but also without ending. These more complicated non-closing non-ending magnetic field lines are moot, though, since the magnetic field of objects that produce them are calculated by adding the magnetic fields of 'elementary parts' having magnetic field lines that do form closed curves or extend to infinity.&lt;/ref&gt; To date no exception to this rule has been found. (See [[#Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)|magnetic monopole]] below.) Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet {{math|'''B'''}}-field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex08&quot;&gt;To see that this must be true imagine placing a compass inside a magnet. There, the north pole of the compass points toward the north pole of the magnet since magnets stacked on each other point in the same direction.&lt;/ref&gt; If a {{math|'''B'''}}-field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point. Magnetic poles, therefore, always come in N and S pairs.

More formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the 'number'&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex09&quot;&gt;As discussed above, magnetic field lines are primarily a conceptual tool used to represent the mathematics behind magnetic fields. The total 'number' of field lines is dependent on how the field lines are drawn. In practice, integral equations such as the one that follows in the main text are used instead.&lt;/ref&gt; of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is a [[surface integral]] over the [[closed surface]] {{math|''S''}} (a closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape). Since {{math|d'''A'''}} points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for {{math|'''B'''}}-field pointing out and negative for {{math|'''B'''}}-field pointing in.

There is also a corresponding differential form of this equation covered in [[#Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equations]] below.

===Force between magnets===
{{Main|Force between magnets}}

The [[magnetic moment#Forces between two magnetic dipoles|force between two small magnets]] is quite complicated and depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and the distance and direction of the magnets relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex04&quot;&gt;Either {{math|'''B'''}} or {{math|'''H'''}} may be used for the magnetic field outside of the magnet.&lt;/ref&gt; of the other.

To understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the ''magnetic pole model'' given above. In this model, the ''{{math|'''H'''}}-field'' of one magnet pushes and pulls on ''both'' poles of a second magnet. If this {{math|'''H'''}}-field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is ''nonuniform'' (such as the {{math|'''H'''}} near one of its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque.

This is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted (or repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet) into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non-uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way.

The details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted/repelled into regions of higher magnetic field.
Mathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} due to a magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}} is:&lt;ref name=Trigg&gt;

See Eq. 11.42 in {{cite book |title=AIP physics desk reference |author= E. Richard Cohen, David R. Lide, George L. Trigg |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JStYf6WlXpgC&amp;pg=PA381 |page=381 |isbn=0-387-98973-0 |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2003 |edition=3}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{\nabla} \left(\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[gradient]] {{math|'''∇'''}} is the change of the quantity {{math|'''m''' · '''B'''}} per unit distance and the direction is that of maximum increase of {{math|'''m''' · '''B'''}}. To understand this equation, note that the [[dot product]] {{math|1='''m''' · '''B''' = ''mB''cos(''θ'')}}, where {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''B''}} represent the [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] of the {{math|'''m'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} vectors and {{math|''θ''}} is the angle between them. If {{math|'''m'''}} is in the same direction as {{math|'''B'''}} then the dot product is positive and the gradient points 'uphill' pulling the magnet into regions of higher {{math|'''B'''}}-field (more strictly larger {{math|'''m''' · '''B'''}}). This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own {{math|'''m'''}} then [[Integral|summing up the forces on each of these very small regions]].

===Magnetic torque on permanent magnets===
{{Main|Magnetic torque}}
If two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a ''magnetic torque'' on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque {{math|'''τ'''}} tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field.

Magnetic torque is used to drive [[electric motor]]s. In one simple motor design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a magnetic field from an array of [[electromagnet]]s. By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft. See [[#Rotating magnetic fields|Rotating magnetic fields]] below.

[[image:Dipole in uniform H field.svg|thumb|left|'''torque on a dipole''': An {{math|'''H'''}} field (to right) causes equal but opposite forces on a N pole ({{math|+''q''}}) and a S pole ({{math|−''q''}}) creating a torque.]]As is the case for the force between magnets, the magnetic pole model leads more readily to the correct equation. Here, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same {{math|'''H'''}} also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance (perpendicular to the force) between them. With the definition of {{math|'''m'''}} as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to {{math|1=''τ'' = ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''mH''sin''θ''}}, where {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a constant called the [[vacuum permeability]], measuring {{val|4|end= π|e=-7}} [[Volt|V]]·[[Second|s]]/([[Ampere|A]]·[[meter|m]]) and {{math|''θ''}} is the angle between {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''m'''}}.

The Amperian loop model also predicts the same magnetic torque. Here, it is the {{math|'''B'''}} field interacting with the Amperian current loop through a [[Lorentz force]] described below. Again, the results are the same although the models are completely different.

[[Image:cross parallelogram.png|thumb|'''Cross product''': {{math|1=&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''a''' × '''b'''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; = ''a b'' sinθ}}.]]
Mathematically, the torque {{math|'''τ'''}} on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} of the magnet:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}=\mathbf{m}\times\mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{m}\times\mathbf{H}, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where × represents the vector [[cross product]]. Note that this equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if {{math|'''m'''}} is in the same direction as the magnetic field. (The cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction.) Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.

==Magnetic field and electric currents==
Currents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B-fields.

===Magnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents===
{{Main|Electromagnet|Biot–Savart law|Ampère's circuital law|l3=Ampère's law}}
[[Image:Manoderecha.svg|thumb|right|[[Right hand grip rule]]: a current flowing in the direction of the white arrow produces a magnetic field shown by the red arrows.]]

All moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving [[point particle|point]] charges, such as [[electron]]s, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic field lines form in [[concentric]] circles around a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] current-carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the &quot;[[right hand grip rule]]&quot; (see figure at right). The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. (For an infinite length wire the strength is inversely proportional to the distance.)
[[Image:Solenoid-1 (vertical).png|50 px|thumb|left|[[Solenoid]]]]

Bending a current-carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or &quot;[[solenoid]]&quot; enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron [[Magnetic core|core]] may act as an ''electromagnet'', generating a strong, well-controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil.

The magnetic field generated by a steady current {{math|I}} (a constant flow of electric charges, in which charge neither accumulates nor is depleted at any point)&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex12&quot;&gt;
In practice, the Biot–Savart law and other laws of magnetostatics are often used even when a current change in time, as long as it does not change too quickly. It is often used, for instance, for standard household currents, which oscillate sixty times per second.
&lt;/ref&gt; is described by the ''[[Biot–Savart law]]'':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = \frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi}\int_{\mathrm{wire}}\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell} \times \mathbf{\hat r}}{r^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral sums over the wire length where vector {{math|d'''ℓ'''}} is the vector [[line element]] with direction in the same sense as the current {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[magnetic constant]], {{math|''r''}} is the distance between the location of {{math|d'''ℓ'''}} and the location where the magnetic field is calculated, and {{math|'''r̂'''}} is a unit vector in the direction of {{math|'''r'''}}.

A slightly more general&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|pp=222&amp;ndash;225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex13&quot;&gt;
The Biot–Savart law contains the additional restriction (boundary condition) that the B-field must go to zero fast enough at infinity. It also depends on the divergence of {{math|'''B'''}} being zero, which is always valid.  (There are no magnetic charges.)&lt;/ref&gt; way of relating the current &lt;math&gt;{I}&lt;/math&gt; to the {{math|'''B'''}}-field is through [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell} = \mu_0 I_{\mathrm{enc}},&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[line integral]] is over any arbitrary loop and &lt;math&gt;{I}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;enc&lt;/sub&gt; is the current enclosed by that loop. Ampère's law is always valid for steady currents and can be used to calculate the {{math|'''B'''}}-field for certain highly symmetric situations such as an infinite wire or an infinite solenoid.

In a modified form that accounts for time varying electric fields, Ampère's law is one of four [[Maxwell's equations]] that describe electricity and magnetism.

===Force on moving charges and current===
[[File:charged-particle-drifts.svg|300px|thumbnail|right|'''Charged particle drifts''' in a magnetic field with (A) no net force, (B) an electric field, {{math|'''E'''}}, (C) a charge independent force, {{math|'''F'''}} (e.g. gravity), and (D) an inhomogeneous magnetic field, {{math|grad '''H'''}}.]]

====Force on a charged particle====
{{Main|Lorentz force}}

A [[charged particle]] moving in a {{math|'''B'''}}-field experiences a ''sideways'' force that is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the charge of the particle. This force is known as the ''Lorentz force'', and is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B},&lt;/math&gt;
where
{{math|'''F'''}} is the [[force]], {{math|''q''}} is the [[electric charge]] of the particle, {{math|'''v'''}} is the instantaneous [[velocity]]  of the particle, and {{math|'''B'''}} is the magnetic field (in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]]).

The Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no [[mechanical work|work]] on an isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non-elementary [[magnetic dipole]], or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect&lt;ref name=Deissler&gt;

====Force on current-carrying wire====
{{Main|Laplace force}}

The force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a charge carrying wire is a collection of moving charges. A current-carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field. The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the ''Laplace force''.
Consider a conductor of length {{math|''ℓ''}}, cross section {{math|''A''}}, and charge {{math|''q''}} due to electric current {{math|''i''}}. If this conductor is placed in a magnetic field of magnitude {{math|''B''}} that makes an angle {{math|θ}} with the velocity of charges in the conductor, the force exerted on a single charge {{math|''q''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;F = qvB \sin\theta,&lt;/math&gt;
so, for {{math|''N''}} charges where 
:&lt;math&gt;N = n \ell A &lt;/math&gt;,
the force exerted on the conductor is
:&lt;math&gt;f=FN=qvB n\ell A \sin\theta = Bi\ell \sin\theta &lt;/math&gt;,
where {{math|1=''i'' = ''nqvA''}}.

[[Image:Regla mano derecha Laplace.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[right-hand rule]]: Pointing the thumb of the right hand in the direction of the [[conventional current]] and the fingers in the direction of {{math|'''B'''}} the force on the current points out of the palm. The force is reversed for a negative charge.]]

====Direction of force====
{{See also|Right-hand rule}}

The direction of force on a charge or a current can be determined by a [[mnemonic]] known as the ''right-hand rule'' (see the figure). Using the right hand and pointing the thumb in the direction of the moving positive charge or positive current and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same current.)  On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field ''can'' distinguish between these, see [[#Hall effect|Hall effect]] below.

An alternative mnemonic to the right hand rule [[Fleming's left-hand rule for motors|Flemings's left hand rule]].

==Relation between H and B==
The formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own [[bound current]], which can be a challenge to calculate.  (This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current loops and the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make up the material.)  The {{math|'''H'''}}-field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of ''magnetization'' first.

===Magnetization===
{{Main|Magnetization}}

The ''magnetization'' vector field {{math|'''M'''}} represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net [[magnetic dipole moment]] per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the SI unit of magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} is ampere per meter, identical to that of the {{math|'''H'''}}-field.

The magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. (Magnetization does not exist outside of the magnet.)

In the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called ''[[bound current]]''. This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field due to the magnet. (See [[#Magnetic dipoles|Magnetic dipoles]] below and [[Magnet#Two models for magnets: magnetic poles and atomic currents|magnetic poles vs. atomic currents]] for more information.) Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|pp=266&amp;ndash;268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\oint \mathbf{M} \cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell} = I_\mathrm{b},&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the 'bound current' enclosed by that closed loop.

In the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive 'magnetic pole strength' (corresponding to a north pole) then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_S \mu_0 \mathbf{M} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} = -q_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt;,

where the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''q''sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the 'magnetic charge' (in units of [[magnetic flux]]) enclosed by {{math|''S''}}. (A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape.) The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.

===H-field and magnetic materials===
{{see also| demagnetizing field}}
In SI units, the H-field is related to the B-field by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}\  \equiv \ \frac{\mathbf{B}}{\mu_0}-\mathbf{M}.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the H-field, Ampere's law is
:&lt;math&gt;\oint \mathbf{H} \cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell} = \oint \left(\frac{\mathbf{B}}{\mu_0} - \mathbf{M}\right) \cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell} = I_{\mathrm{tot}}- I_{\mathrm{b}} = I_{\mathrm{f}},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of {{math|'''H'''}} does not depend at all on the bound currents.&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;{{cite book |title=Electromagnetism |author=John Clarke Slater, Nathaniel Herman Frank |url=http://books.google.com/?id=GYsphnFwUuUC&amp;pg=PA69 |page=69 |isbn=0-486-62263-0 |year=1969 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |edition=first published in 1947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the differential equivalent of this equation see [[#Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equations]]. Ampere's law leads to the boundary condition 
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{H_1^\parallel} - \mathbf{H_2^\parallel}) = \mathbf{K}_\mathrm{f} \times \hat{\mathbf{n}},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''K'''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the surface free current density and the unit normal &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{n}} &lt;/math&gt; points in the direction from medium 2 to medium 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a [[surface integral]] of {{math|'''H'''}} over any [[closed surface]] is independent of the free currents and picks out the 'magnetic charges' within that closed surface:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_S \mu_0 \mathbf{H} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} = \oint_S (\mathbf{B}- \mu_0 \mathbf{M})\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}= (0 - (-q_\mathrm{M})) = q_\mathrm{M},&lt;/math&gt;

which does not depend on the free currents.

The {{math|'''H'''}}-field, therefore, can be separated into two&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;A third term is needed for changing electric fields and polarization currents; this displacement current term is covered in Maxwell's equations below.&lt;/ref&gt; independent parts:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{H}_0 + \mathbf{H}_\mathrm{d}, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and {{math|'''H'''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[demagnetizing field]] due only to the bound currents.

The magnetic {{math|'''H'''}}-field, therefore, re-factors the bound current in terms of 'magnetic charges'. The {{math|'''H'''}} field lines loop only around 'free current' and, unlike the magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.

===Magnetism===
{{Main|Magnetism}}
Most materials respond to an applied {{math|'''B'''}}-field by producing their own magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} and therefore their own {{math|'''B'''}}-field. Typically, the response is weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied. The term ''magnetism'' describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic [[phase (matter)|phase]] of a material. Materials are divided into groups based upon their magnetic behavior:
*[[diamagnetism|Diamagnetic materials]]&lt;ref name=Tilley&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; produce a magnetization that opposes the magnetic field.
*[[paramagnetism|Paramagnetic materials]]&lt;ref name=Tilley/&gt; produce a magnetization in the same direction as the applied magnetic field.

&lt;/ref&gt;  can have a magnetization independent of an applied B-field with a complex relationship between the two fields.

&lt;/ref&gt; are materials that are characterized by perfect conductivity below a critical temperature and magnetic field. They also are highly magnetic and can be perfect diamagnets below a lower critical magnetic field. Superconductors often have a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields (the so named [[Type II superconductor#Mixed state|mixed state]]) under which they exhibit a complex hysteretic dependence of {{math|'''M'''}} on {{math|'''B'''}}.

In the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \mu \mathbf{H},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''μ''}} is a material dependent parameter called the [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]]. In some cases the permeability may be a second rank [[tensor]] so that {{math|'''H'''}} may not point in the same direction as {{math|'''B'''}}. These relations between {{math|'''B'''}}  and {{math|'''H'''}} are examples of [[constitutive equation]]s.    However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex {{math|'''B'''}} to {{math|'''H'''}} relation; see [[hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|magnetic hysteresis]].

==Energy stored in magnetic fields==
{{Main|Magnetic energy}}
{{see also|Hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|l1=Magnetic hysteresis}}

Energy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive materials this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that this energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field.

For linear, non-dispersive, materials (such that {{math|1='''B''' = ''μ'''''H'''}} where {{math|''μ''}} is frequency-independent), the [[energy density]] is:

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{H}}{2}= \frac{\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{B}}{2\mu} = \frac{\mu\mathbf{H}\cdot\mathbf{H}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

If there are no magnetic materials around then {{math|''μ''}} can be replaced by {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used.

In general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume {{math|''δW''}} needed to cause a small change of magnetic field {{math|''δ'''''B'''}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \mathbf{H}\cdot\delta\mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;

Once the relationship between {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For [[Hysteresis|hysteretic materials]] such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non-dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.

==Electromagnetism: the relationship between magnetic and electric fields==
{{Main|Electromagnetism}}

===Faraday's Law: Electric force due to a changing B-field===
{{Main|Faraday's law of induction|Magnetic flux|l1=Faraday's law}}

A changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an [[electric field]] (and therefore tends to drive a current in such a coil). This is known as ''Faraday's law'' and forms the basis of many [[electrical generator]]s and [[electric motor]]s.

Mathematically, Faraday's law is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = - \frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{d}t},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electromotive force]] (or ''EMF'', the [[voltage]] generated around a closed loop) and {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the ''magnetic flux''—the product of the area times the magnetic field [[Tangential and normal components|normal]] to that area.  (This definition of magnetic flux is why {{math|'''B'''}} is often referred to as ''magnetic flux density''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=John David|title=Classical electrodynamics|date=1975|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471431329|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210}}

The negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that ''opposes'' the ''change'' in the magnetic field that induced it. This phenomenon is known as [[Lenz's law]].

This integral formulation of Faraday's law can be converted&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex14&quot;&gt;

A complete expression for Faraday's law of induction in terms of the electric {{math|'''E'''}} and magnetic fields can be written as:
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathcal{E} = - \frac{d\Phi_m}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle= \oint_{\partial \Sigma (t)}\left(  \mathbf{E}( \mathbf{r},\ t) +\mathbf{ v \times B}(\mathbf{r},\ t)\right) \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell}\ &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle=-\frac {d} {dt}  \iint_{\Sigma (t)} d \boldsymbol {A} \cdot \mathbf {B}(\mathbf{r},\ t),&lt;/math&gt;
 where {{math|'''∂Σ'''(''t'')}} is the moving closed path bounding the moving surface {{math|'''Σ'''(''t'')}}, and {{math|d'''A'''}} is an element of surface area of {{math|'''Σ'''(''t'')}}. The first integral calculates the work done moving a charge a distance {{math|d'''ℓ'''}} based upon the [[Lorentz force]] law. In the case where the bounding surface is stationary, the [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]] can be used to show this equation is equivalent to the Maxwell–Faraday equation.

&lt;/ref&gt; into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions. This form is covered as one of Maxwell's equations below.

===Maxwell's correction to Ampère's Law: The magnetic field due to a changing electric field===
{{Main|Ampère's circuital law#Extending the original law: the Maxwell–Ampère equation|l1=Maxwell's correction to Ampère's law}}
Similar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as ''Maxwell's correction to Ampère's law''. Maxwell's correction to Ampère's Law [[bootstrapping|bootstrap]] together with Faraday's law of induction to form [[electromagnetic waves]], such as light. Thus, a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again.

Maxwell's correction to Ampère law is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law given above. This additive term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field.)

This full Ampère law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell–Ampère equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used. The Maxwell term ''is'' critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.

===Maxwell's equations===
{{Main|Maxwell's equations}}

Like all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its ''sources''.  (For {{math|'''B'''}} the ''sources'' are currents and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up ''Maxwell's Equations''. Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of [[Classical electromagnetism|classical electrodynamics]] including both electricity and magnetism.

The first property is the [[divergence]] of a vector field {{math|'''A'''}}, {{math|'''∇''' · '''A'''}}, which represents how {{math|'''A'''}} 'flows' outward from a given point. As discussed above, a {{math|'''B'''}}-field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of {{math|'''B'''}} is zero. (Such vector fields are called [[solenoidal vector field]]s.) This property is called [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or [[magnetic monopole]]s. The electric field on the other hand begins and ends at electric charges so that its divergence is non-zero and proportional to the [[charge density]] (See [[Gauss's law]]).

The second mathematical property is called the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]], such that {{math|'''∇''' × '''A'''}} represents how {{math|'''A'''}} curls or 'circulates' around a given point. The result of the curl is called a 'circulation source'. The equations for the curl of {{math|'''B'''}} and of {{math|'''E'''}} are called the [[Ampère–Maxwell equation]] and [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] respectively. They represent the differential forms of the integral equations given above.

The complete set of Maxwell's equations then are:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}} {\partial t},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} =  - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''J'''}} = complete microscopic [[current density]] and {{math|''ρ''}} is the charge density.

[[File:BIsAPseudovector.svg|thumb|right|'''Magnetic field, like all [[pseudovector]]s, changes sign when reflected in a mirror''': When a [[electric current|current]] carrying loop (black) is [[mirror image|reflected in a mirror]] (dotted line), its magnetic field (blue) is reflected ''and'' reversed.]]
Technically, {{math|'''B'''}} is a [[pseudovector]] (also called an ''axial vector'') due to being defined by a vector cross product. (See diagram.)

As discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric {{math|'''E'''}} field and an applied magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field by producing their own internal 'bound' charge and current distributions that contribute to {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''D'''}} fields are used to re-factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the ''free current density'' {{math|'''J'''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}} and ''free charge density'' {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \rho_\mathrm{f},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J}_\mathrm{f} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}} {\partial t},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} =  - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}. &lt;/math&gt;

These equations are not any more general than the original equations (if the 'bound' charges and currents in the material are known). They also must be supplemented by the relationship between {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} as well as that between {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''D'''}}. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.

===Electric and magnetic fields: different aspects of the same phenomenon===
{{Main|Relativistic electromagnetism}}

According to [[special relativity|the special theory of relativity]], the partition of the [[electromagnetic force]] into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the [[Frame of reference#Observational frames of reference|observational frame of reference]]: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces.

Formally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank-2 [[tensor]], called the ''[[electromagnetic tensor]]''. Changing reference frames ''mixes'' these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity ''mixes'' space and time into [[spacetime]], and mass, momentum and energy into [[four-momentum]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Doran and A. Lasenby (2003) ''Geometric Algebra for Physicists'', Cambridge University Press, p. 233. ISBN 0521715954.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic vector potential===
{{Main|Magnetic potential}}

In advanced topics such as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the ''[[magnetic vector potential|vector potential]]'' {{math|'''A'''}}, and the [[electric potential|scalar potential]] {{math|''φ''}}, are defined such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = - \nabla \varphi - \frac { \partial \mathbf{A} } { \partial t }.&lt;/math&gt;
The vector potential {{math|'''A'''}} may be interpreted as a ''generalized potential [[momentum]] per unit charge''&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite journal |author=E. J. Konopinski |authorlink=Emil Konopinski |year= 1978 |title=What the electromagnetic vector potential describes |journal= Am. J. Phys. |volume= 46|issue= 5|pages= 499–502 |doi=10.1119/1.11298|bibcode = 1978AmJPh..46..499K }}

&lt;/ref&gt; just as {{math|''φ''}} is interpreted as a ''generalized [[potential energy]] per unit charge''.

Maxwell's equations when expressed in terms of the potentials can be cast into a form that agrees with [[special relativity]] with little effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relativity {{math|'''A'''}} together with {{math|''φ''}} forms the [[four-potential]], analogous to the [[Four-vector#Four-momentum|four-momentum]] that combines the momentum and energy of a particle. Using the four potential instead of the electromagnetic tensor has the advantage of being much simpler—and it can be easily modified to work with quantum mechanics.

===Quantum electrodynamics===
{{See also|Standard Model|quantum electrodynamics}}
In modern physics, the electromagnetic field is understood to be not a ''[[classical physics|classical]]'' [[field (physics)|field]], but rather a [[quantum field]]; it is represented not as a vector of three [[real number|numbers]] at each point, but as a vector of three [[operator (physics)|quantum operators]] at each point. The most accurate modern description of the electromagnetic interaction (and much else) is ''quantum electrodynamics'' (QED),&lt;ref&gt;
For a good qualitative introduction see:
{{Cite book|author=Richard Feynman|authorlink=Richard Feynman|title=[[QED (book)|QED: the strange theory of light and matter]]|year=2006|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0-691-12575-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the ''Standard Model of particle physics''.

In QED, the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles (and their [[antiparticle]]s) is computed using [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]. These rather complex formulas produce a remarkable pictorial representation as [[Feynman diagram]]s in which [[virtual photon]]s are exchanged.

Predictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of accuracy: currently about 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;12&lt;/sup&gt; (and limited by experimental errors); for details see [[precision tests of QED]]. This makes QED one of the most accurate physical theories constructed thus far.

All equations in this article are in the [[classical electromagnetism|classical approximation]], which is less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here. However, under most everyday circumstances, the difference between the two theories is negligible.

==Important uses and examples of magnetic field==

===Earth's magnetic field===
{{Main|Earth's magnetic field}}
[[Image:Earths Magnetic Field Confusion.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|A sketch of Earth's magnetic field representing the source of the field as a magnet. The geographic north pole of Earth is near the top of the diagram, the south pole near the bottom. The south pole of that magnet is deep in Earth's interior below Earth's North Magnetic Pole.]]

The Earth's magnetic field is thought to be produced by convection currents in the outer liquid of Earth's core. The [[Dynamo theory]] proposes that these movements produce electric currents that, in turn, produce the magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yahreas Herbert |date=June 1954 |title=What makes the earth Wobble |journal=Popular Science |location=New York |publisher=Godfrey Hammond |page=266 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=NiEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of this field causes a compass, placed anywhere within it, to rotate so that the &quot;north pole&quot; of the magnet in the compass points roughly north, toward Earth's [[North Magnetic Pole]]. This is the traditional definition of the &quot;north pole&quot; of a magnet, although other equivalent definitions are also possible.

One confusion that arises from this definition is that, if Earth itself is considered as a magnet, the ''south'' pole of that magnet would be the one nearer the north magnetic pole, and vice versa. The north magnetic pole is so-named not because of the polarity of the field there but because of its geographical location. The north and south poles of a permanent magnet are so-called because they are &quot;north-seeking&quot; and &quot;south-seeking&quot;, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond A. Serway|title=College physics|year=2009|publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-495-38693-3|edition=8th |author2=Chris Vuille |author3=Jerry S. Faughn  |page=628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/magnets.htm |title=Magnets |author=Ron Kurtus |year=2004 |work=School for champions: Physics topics |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure is a sketch of Earth's magnetic field represented by field lines. For most locations, the magnetic field has a significant up/down component in addition to the north/south component.  (There is also an east/west component, as Earth's magnetic and geographical poles do not coincide.) The magnetic field can be visualised as a bar magnet buried deep in Earth's interior.

Earth's magnetic field is not constant—the strength of the field and the location of its poles vary. Moreover, the poles periodically reverse their orientation in a process called [[geomagnetic reversal]]. The [[Brunhes–Matuyama reversal|most recent reversal]] occurred 780,000 years ago.

===Rotating magnetic fields===
{{Main|Rotating magnetic field|Alternator}}

The ''rotating magnetic field'' is a key principle in the operation of [[electric motor#AC motors|alternating-current motors]]. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was conceptualized by [[Nikola Tesla]], and later utilized in his, and others', early AC ([[alternating current]]) electric motors.

A rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with unequal currents.

This inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so, to overcome it, [[three-phase]] systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three-phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world's [[electrical power]] supply systems.

[[Synchronous motor]]s use DC-voltage-fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlled—and [[induction motor]]s use short-circuited [[Rotor (electric)|rotors]] (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled [[stator]]. The short-circuited turns of the rotor develop [[eddy current]]s in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the [[Lorentz force]].

In 1882, Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic field. In 1885, [[Galileo Ferraris]] independently researched the concept. In 1888, Tesla gained {{US patent|381968}} for his work. Also in 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the ''Royal Academy of Sciences'' in [[Turin]].

===Hall effect===
{{Main|Hall effect}}

The charge carriers of a current carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the ''Hall effect''.

The ''Hall effect'' is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors (negative electrons or positive holes).

===Magnetic circuits===
{{Main|Magnetic circuit}}
An important use of {{math|'''H'''}} is in ''magnetic circuits'' where {{math|1='''B''' = ''μ'''''H'''}} inside a linear material. Here, {{math|''μ''}} is the [[magnetic permeability]] of the material. This result is similar in form to [[Ohm's law]] {{math|'''J''' {{=}} ''σ'''''E'''}}, where {{math|'''J'''}} is the current density, {{math|''σ''}} is the conductance and {{math|'''E'''}} is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law ({{math|1=''I'' = ''V''⁄''R''}}) is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \frac F R_\mathrm{m},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi = \int \mathbf{B}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic flux in the circuit, &lt;math&gt;F = \int \mathbf{H}\cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\ell}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetomotive force]]  applied to the circuit, and {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[reluctance]] of the circuit. Here the reluctance {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a quantity similar in nature to [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] for the flux.

Using this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of [[circuit theory]].

*An ''azimuthal'' magnetic field is one that runs east–west.
*A ''meridional'' magnetic field is one that runs north–south. In the [[solar dynamo]] model of the Sun, [[differential rotation]] of the solar plasma causes the meridional magnetic field to stretch into an azimuthal magnetic field, a process called the ''omega-effect''. The reverse process is called the ''alpha-effect''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cora.nwra.com/~werne/eos/text/dynamo.html The Solar Dynamo]. Retrieved 15 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[magnetic dipole|''dipole'' magnetic field]] is one seen around a bar magnet or around a [[electric charge|charged]] [[elementary particle]] with nonzero [[spin (physics)|spin]].
*A [[quadrupole magnet|''quadrupole'' magnetic field]] is one seen, for example, between the poles of four bar magnets. The field strength grows linearly with the radial distance from its longitudinal axis.
*A ''solenoidal'' magnetic field is similar to a dipole magnetic field, except that a solid bar magnet is replaced by a hollow electromagnetic coil magnet.
*A ''toroidal'' magnetic field occurs in a doughnut-shaped coil, the electric current spiraling around the tube-like surface, and is found, for example, in a [[tokamak]].
*A ''poloidal'' magnetic field is generated by a current flowing in a ring, and is found, for example, in a [[tokamak]].
*A ''radial'' magnetic field is one in which field lines are directed from the center outwards, similar to the spokes in a bicycle wheel.

===Magnetic dipoles===
[[Image:VFPt dipole magnetic3.svg|thumbnail|Magnetic field lines around a ”magnetostatic dipole” pointing to the right.]]
{{Main|Magnetic dipole}}
{{See also|Spin magnetic moment|Micromagnetism}}

The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is depicted in the figure. From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current {{math|''I''}} and an area {{math|''a''}}. Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of:

:&lt;math&gt;m=Ia, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where the direction of {{math|'''m'''}} is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area {{math|''a''}} has been reduced to zero and its current {{math|''I''}} increased to infinity such that the product {{math|1=''m'' = ''Ia''}} is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the [[Einstein–de Haas effect]] ''rotation by magnetization'' and its inverse, the [[Barnett effect]] or ''magnetization by rotation''.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;See [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic dipoles|magnetic moment]]  and {{cite book |title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials |author=B. D. Cullity, C. D. Graham |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ixAe4qIGEmwC&amp;pg=PA103 |page=103 |isbn=0-471-47741-9 |year=2008 |publisher=Wiley-IEEE |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotating the loop faster (in the same direction) increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment, for example.

It is sometimes useful to model the magnetic dipole similar to the electric dipole with two equal but opposite magnetic charges (one south the other north) separated by distance {{math|''d''}}. This model produces an {{math|'''H'''}}-field not a {{math|'''B'''}}-field. Such a model is deficient, though, both in that there are no magnetic charges and in that it obscures the link between electricity and magnetism. Further, as discussed above it fails to explain the inherent connection between [[angular momentum]] and magnetism.

===Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)===
{{Main|Magnetic monopole}}

A ''magnetic monopole'' is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that has, as its name suggests, only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a south pole). In other words, it would possess a &quot;magnetic charge&quot; analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end.

Modern interest in this concept stems from [[high-energy physics|particle theories]], notably [[Grand Unified Theory|Grand Unified Theories]] and [[superstring theory|superstring theories]], that predict either the existence, or the possibility, of magnetic monopoles. These theories and others have inspired extensive efforts to search for monopoles. Despite these efforts, no magnetic monopole has been observed to date.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex10&quot;&gt;Two experiments produced candidate events that were initially interpreted as monopoles, but these are now considered inconclusive. For details and references, see [[magnetic monopole]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent research, materials known as [[spin ice]]s can simulate monopoles, but do not contain actual monopoles.&lt;ref name=&quot;monopole&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091015085916.htm |title='Magnetricity' Observed And Measured For First Time |work=[[Science Daily]] |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MonopoleReview&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.J.P.

{{Humidity|img=Cloud forest mount kinabalu.jpg}}&lt;!-- caption: Tropical forests often have high humidity --&gt;

'''Humidity'''  is the amount of [[water vapor]] in the air. Water vapor is the gaseous state of water and is invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Water Vapour|url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_is_water_vapor.htm|accessdate=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humidity indicates the likelihood of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[dew]], or [[fog]].  Higher humidity reduces the effectiveness of [[sweating]] in cooling the body by reducing the rate of [[evaporation]] of moisture from the skin.  This effect is calculated in a [[heat index]] table or [[humidex]].

There are three main measurements of humidity: absolute, relative and specific. '''Absolute humidity''' is the water content of air at a given temperature expressed in gram per cubic metre.&lt;ref&gt;Wyer, S.S., &quot;A treatise on producer-gas and gas-producers&quot;, (1906) The Engineering and Mining Journal, London, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; '''Relative humidity''', expressed as a percent, measures the current absolute humidity ''relative'' to the maximum (highest point) for that temperature. '''Specific humidity''' is a [[ratio]] of the water vapor content of the mixture to the total air content on a mass basis.

[[File:Antarctic Air Visits Paranal.jpg|thumb|[[Paranal Observatory]] on [[Cerro Paranal]] in the [[Atacama Desert]] is one of the driest places on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Antarctic Air Visits Paranal|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1405a/|accessdate=4 February 2014|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

===Absolute humidity===

Absolute humidity is the total mass of water vapor present in a given volume of air. It does not take temperature into consideration. Absolute humidity in the atmosphere ranges from near zero to roughly 30&amp;nbsp;grams per cubic meter when the air is saturated at 30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-53259/climate#292984.hook]
(See also [http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/misc/klima.htm Climate/Humidity table])&lt;/ref&gt;

Absolute humidity is the mass of the water vapor (&lt;math&gt; m_w &lt;/math&gt;), divided by the volume of the air and water vapor mixture (&lt;math&gt; p_{net} &lt;/math&gt;), which can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; AH = {m_w \over p_{net}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The absolute humidity changes as air [[temperature]] or [[pressure]] changes.  This makes it unsuitable for [[chemical engineering]] calculations, e.g. for [[clothes dryer]]s, where temperature can vary considerably.  As a result, absolute humidity in chemical engineering may refer to mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air, also known as the ''mass mixing ratio'' (see &quot;specific humidity&quot; below), which is better suited for heat and mass balance calculations.  Mass of water per unit volume as in the equation above is also defined as ''volumetric humidity''.  Because of the potential confusion, [[British Standard]] BS 1339 (revised 2002) suggests avoiding the term &quot;absolute humidity&quot;.  Units should always be carefully checked.  Many humidity charts are given in g/kg or kg/kg, but any mass units may be used.

The field concerned with the study of physical and thermodynamic properties of gas–vapor mixtures is named [[psychrometrics]].

===Relative humidity===
{{Main|Relative humidity}}

The relative humidity &lt;math&gt; \left(\phi\right) &lt;/math&gt; of an air-water mixture is defined as the ratio of the [[partial pressure]] of water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) &lt;math&gt; \left({e_w}\right) &lt;/math&gt; in the mixture to the saturated [[vapor pressure]] of water &lt;math&gt; \left({{e^*}_w}\right) &lt;/math&gt; at a given temperature.  Thus the relative humidity of air is a function of both water content and temperature.

Relative humidity is normally expressed as a percentage and is calculated by using the following equation:&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;&gt;Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W, ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'' (7th Edition), [[McGraw-Hill]], ISBN 0-07-049841-5 , Eqn 12-7&lt;/ref&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; \phi  =  {{e_w} \over {{e^*}_w}} \times 100\% &lt;/math&gt;

Relative humidity is an important [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] used in [[weather forecasting|weather forecasts]] and reports, as it is an indicator of the likelihood of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], dew, or fog.  In hot summer [[weather]], a rise in relative humidity increases the [[heat index|apparent temperature]] to [[human]]s (and other [[animal]]s) by hindering the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin. For example, according to the [[Heat Index]], a relative humidity of 75% at 80.0&amp;nbsp;°F (26.7&amp;nbsp;°C) would feel like 83.6&amp;nbsp;°F ±1.3&amp;nbsp;°F (28.7&amp;nbsp;°C ±0.7&amp;nbsp;°C) at ~44% relative humidity.&lt;ref&gt;Lans P. Rothfusz. &quot;The Heat Index 'Equation' (or, More Than You Ever Wanted to Know About Heat Index)&quot;, Scientific Services Division (NWS Southern Region Headquarters), 1 July 1990 [http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/ffc/pdf/ta_htindx.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Steadman, 1979. &quot;The assessment of sultriness. Part I: A temperature-humidity index based on human physiology and clothing science,&quot; J. Appl. Meteor., 18, 861-873&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific humidity===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Relative humidity]] --&gt;
''Specific humidity'' (or moisture content) is the ratio of water vapor mass (&lt;math&gt; m_v &lt;/math&gt;) to the air parcel's ''total'' (i.e., including dry) mass (&lt;math&gt; m_a &lt;/math&gt;) and is sometimes referred to as the humidity ratio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace 2006, pp. 80&quot;&gt;Wallace, John and Hobbs, Peter, ''Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey'', 2006, 2nd edition, Elsevier, pp. 80&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific humidity is approximately equal to the &quot;mixing ratio&quot;, which is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of ''dry'' air for the same parcel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace 2006, pp. 80&quot;/&gt;

Specific Humidity is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; SH = {m_v \over m_a}. &lt;/math&gt;

Specific humidity can be expressed in other ways including:

:&lt;math&gt; SH = {0.622 \times {p_{(H_2O)}} \over {p_{(dry\, air)}}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 0.622 = {{MM_{H_2O}} \over {MM_{dry\, air}}} &lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt; SH = {{0.622 \times p_{(H_2O)}}\over {p-0.378 \times p_{(H_2O)}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using this definition of specific humidity, the relative humidity can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; \phi = {{SH \times p}\over {(0.622+0.378 \times SH) p^*_{(H_2O)}}}\times 100 &lt;/math&gt;

However, specific humidity is also defined as the ratio of water vapor to the total mass of the system (dry air plus water vapor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=specific-humidity1 AMS Glossary: specific humidity]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ASHRAE 2009 Handbook, Ch1,1.2, (9a) defines specific humidity as &quot;the ratio of the mass of water vapor to total mass of the moist air sample&quot;.

==Measurement==
[[Image:Umidaderelativa.jpg|thumb|A [[hygrometer]]]]

There are various devices used to measure and regulate humidity. A device used to measure humidity is called a psychrometer or [[hygrometer]]. A [[humidistat]] is a humidity-triggered switch, often used to control a [[dehumidifier]].

Humidity is also measured on a global scale using remotely placed [[satellite]]s. These satellites are able to detect the [[concentration]] of water in the [[troposphere]] at altitudes between 4 and 12 kilometers. Satellites that can measure water vapor have sensors that are sensitive to [[infrared|infrared radiation]]. Water vapor specifically absorbs and re-radiates radiation in this spectral band. Satellite water vapor imagery plays an important role in monitoring climate conditions (like the formation of thunderstorms) and in the development of future [[weather forecasts]].

==Climate==
{{See also|Greenhouse Effect|Precipitation (meteorology)|Humid subtropical climate}}
While humidity itself is a climate variable, it also interacts strongly with other climate variables. The humidity is affected by winds and by rainfall. At the same time, humidity affects the [[energy budget]] and thereby influences temperatures in two major ways. First, water vapor in the atmosphere contains &quot;latent&quot; energy. During transpiration or evaporation, this [[latent heat]] is removed from surface liquid, cooling the earth's surface. This is the biggest non-radiative cooling effect at the surface. It compensates for roughly 70% of the average net radiative warming at the surface.

Second, water vapor is the most abundant of all [[greenhouse gases]]. Water vapor, like a green lens that allows green light to pass through it but absorbs red light, is a &quot;selective absorber&quot;. Along with other greenhouse gases, water vapor is transparent to most solar energy, as you can literally see. But it absorbs the infrared energy emitted (radiated) upward by the earth's surface, which is the reason that humid areas experience very little nocturnal cooling but dry desert regions cool considerably at night. This selective absorption causes the greenhouse effect. It raises the surface temperature substantially above its theoretical radiative equilibrium temperature with the sun, and water vapor is the cause of more of this warming than any other greenhouse gas.

Unlike most other greenhouse gases, however, water is not merely below its boiling point in all regions of the Earth, but below its freezing point at many altitudes.  As a condensible greenhouse gas, it [[precipitates]], with a much lower [[scale height]] and shorter atmospheric lifetime- weeks instead of decades.

The most humid cities on earth are generally located closer to the equator, near coastal regions. Cities in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] are among the most humid. [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Singapore]] have very high humidity all year round because of their proximity to water bodies and the [[equator]] and often overcast weather. Some places experience extreme humidity during their rainy seasons combined with warmth giving the feel of a lukewarm sauna, such as [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]] and [[Cochin]] in [[India]], and [[Lahore]] in [[Pakistan]]. [[Sukkur]] city located on the [[Indus River]] in Pakistan has some of the highest and most uncomfortable [[dew point]] in the country frequently exceeding {{convert|30|C|F|}} in the [[Monsoon]] season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPSK/2013/7/6/DailyHistory.html&lt;/ref&gt; High temperatures couple up with bizarre dew point to create heat index in excess of {{convert|65|C|F|}}. [[Darwin, Australia]] experiences an extremely humid wet season from December to April. [[Shanghai]] and [[Hong Kong]] in [[China]] also have an extreme humid period in their summer months. During the South-west and North-east Monsoon seasons (respectively, late May to September and November to March), expect heavy rains and a relatively high humidity post-rainfall. Outside the monsoon seasons, humidity is high (in comparison to countries North of the Equator), but completely sunny days abound. In cooler places such as Northern Tasmania, Australia, high humidity is experienced all year due to the ocean between mainland Australia and Tasmania. In the summer the hot dry air is absorbed by this ocean and the temperature rarely climbs above {{convert|35|C|0|abbr=on}}.

In the United States the most humid cities, strictly in terms of [[relative humidity]], are [[Forks, Washington|Forks]] and [[Olympia, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komotv.com/news/archive/4092941.html What Is The Most Humid City In The U.S.? | KOMO-TV – Seattle, Washington | News Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This fact may come as a surprise to many, as the climate in this region rarely exhibits the discomfort usually associated with high humidity. This is because high [[dew point]]s play a more significant role than relative humidity in discomfort, and so the air in these western cities usually does not feel &quot;humid&quot; as a result. In general, dew points are much lower in the Western U.S. than those in the Eastern U.S.

The highest dew points in the US are found in coastal [[Florida]] and [[Texas]]. When comparing [[Key West]] and [[Houston]], two of the most humid cities from those states, coastal Florida seems to have the higher dew points on average. However, Houston lacks the coastal breeze present in Key West, and, as a much larger city, it suffers from the [[urban heat island]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/2003-09-03-answers-fla-texas-humidity_x.htm Answers: Is Florida or Texas more humid: September 3,2003]&lt;/ref&gt;  A dew point of {{convert|88|F|0|abbr=on}} was recorded in Moorhead [[Minnesota]] on July 19, 2011, with a heat index of 133.5, although dew points over {{convert|80|F|0|abbr=on}} are rare there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/blogs/125847178.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The US city with the lowest annual humidity is [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], averaging 39% for a high and 21% as a low.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityrating.com/relativehumidity.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  Appleton, Wisconsin registered a dew point of 90 degrees F on 13 July 1995 with an air temperature of 104 degrees resulting in a heat index of 149 degrees; this record has apparently held and in fact the highest dew point measured in the country bounced amongst or was tied by locations in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa during the preceding 70 years or more with locations in northern Illinois also coming close.  Dew points of 95 degrees are found on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia at certain times.

==Air density and volume==
{{Main|Volume (thermodynamics)|Density of air}}

Humidity depends on water vaporization and condensation, which, in turn, mainly depends on temperature. Therefore, when applying more pressure to a gas saturated with water, all components will initially decrease in volume approximately according to the [[ideal gas law]]. However, some of the water will condense until returning to almost the same humidity as before, giving the resulting total volume deviating from what the ideal gas law predicted. Conversely, decreasing temperature would also make some water condense, again making the final volume deviate from predicted by the ideal gas law. Therefore, gas volume may alternatively be expressed as the dry volume, excluding the humidity content. This fraction more accurately follows the ideal gas law. On the contrary the saturated volume is the volume a gas mixture would have if humidity was added to it until saturation (or 100% relative humidity).

Humid air is less dense than dry air because a molecule of water ([[molecular mass|M]] ≈ 18 [[atomic mass unit|u]]) is less massive than either a molecule of [[nitrogen]] (M ≈ 28) or a molecule of [[oxygen]] (M ≈ 32). About 78% of  the molecules in dry air are nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Another 21% of the molecules in dry air are oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The final 1% of dry air is a mixture of other gases.

For any gas, at a given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules present in a particular volume is constant – see [[ideal gas law]]. So when water molecules (vapor) are introduced into that volume of dry air, the number of air molecules in the volume must decrease by the same number, if the temperature and pressure remain constant.  (The addition of water molecules, or any other molecules, to a gas, without removal of an equal number of other molecules, will necessarily require a change in temperature, pressure, or total volume; that is, a change in ''at least'' one of these three parameters.  If temperature and pressure remain constant, the volume increases, and the dry air molecules that were displaced will initially move out into the additional volume, after which the mixture will eventually become uniform through diffusion.)  Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas—its density—decreases. [[Isaac Newton]] discovered this phenomenon and wrote about it in his book ''[[Opticks]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;optics&quot;&gt;

==Effects==

===Animals and plants===
Humidity is one of the fundamental [[abiotic factor]]s that defines any habitat, and is a determinant of which animals and plants can thrive in a given environment.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 ''Abiotic factor''. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment]. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;

The human body dissipates heat through perspiration and its evaporation. [[Heat convection]] to the surrounding air, and [[thermal radiation]] are the primary modes of heat transport from the body. Under conditions of high humidity, the rate of evaporation of sweat from the skin decreases. Also, if the atmosphere is as warm as or warmer than the skin during times of high humidity, [[blood]] brought to the body surface cannot dissipate heat by conduction to the air, and a condition called [[hyperthermia]] results. With so much blood going to the external surface of the body, relatively less goes to the active [[muscle]]s, the [[Human brain|brain]], and other internal [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. [[Physical strength]] declines, and [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] occurs sooner than it would otherwise. Alertness and mental capacity also may be affected, resulting in ''heat stroke'' or [[hyperthermia]].

===Human comfort===
Humans are sensitive to humid air because the human body uses evaporative cooling as the primary mechanism to regulate temperature. Under humid conditions, the ''rate'' at which perspiration evaporates on the skin is lower than it would be under arid conditions. Because humans perceive the rate of heat transfer from the body rather than temperature itself, we feel warmer when the relative humidity is high than when it is low.

Some people experience difficulty breathing in humid environments. Some cases may possibly be related to respiratory conditions such as [[asthma]], while others may be the product of [[anxiety]]. Sufferers will often [[hyperventilation|hyperventilate]] in response, causing sensations of [[numbness]], [[faintness]], and loss of [[Attentional control|concentration]], among others.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Air conditioning]] reduces discomfort in the summer not only by reducing temperature, but also by reducing humidity. In winter, heating cold outdoor air can decrease relative humidity levels indoor to below 30%{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}, leading to discomfort such as dry skin, cracked lips and excessive thirst.

===Electronics===
Many electronic devices have humidity specifications, for example, 5% to 45%.  At the top end of the range, moisture may increase the conductivity of permeable [[Insulator (electrical)|insulators]] leading to malfunction. Too low humidity may make materials brittle. A particular danger to electronic items, regardless of the stated operating humidity range, is [[condensation]]. When an electronic item is moved from a cold place (e.g. garage, car, shed, an air conditioned space in the tropics) to a warm humid place (house, outside tropics), condensation may coat circuit boards and other insulators, leading to [[short circuit]] inside the equipment. Such short circuits may cause substantial permanent damage if the equipment is powered on before the condensation has [[evaporated]]. A similar condensation effect can often be observed when a person wearing glasses comes in from the cold (i.e. the glasses become foggy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fogging Glasses|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen01/gen01333.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is advisable to allow electronic equipment to acclimatise for several hours, after being brought in from the cold, before powering on. Some electronic devices can detect such a change and indicate, when plugged in and usually with a small droplet symbol, that they cannot be used until the risk from condensation has passed. In situations where time is critical, increasing air flow through the device's internals, such as removing the side panel from a PC case and directing a fan to blow into the case, will reduce significantly the time needed to acclimatise to the new environment.

In contrast, a very low humidity level favors the build-up of [[static electricity]], which may result in spontaneous shutdown of computers when discharges occur. Apart from spurious erratic function, electrostatic discharges can cause dielectric breakdown in solid state devices, resulting in irreversible damage. [[Data center]]s often monitor relative humidity levels for these reasons.

===Building construction===
Common construction methods, often produce building enclosures with a poor thermal boundary, an [[Building insulation|insulation]] and air barrier system designed to retain indoor environmental conditions while resisting external environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/name,45205,en.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The energy-efficient, heavily-sealed architecture introduced in the 20th century also sealed off the movement of moisture, and this has resulted in a secondary problem of [[condensation]] forming in and around walls, which encourages the development of mold and mildew. Additionally, buildings with foundations not properly sealed will allow water to flow through the walls due to [[capillary action]] of pores found in masonry products. Solutions for energy-efficient buildings that avoid condensation are a current topic of architecture.

===Industry===
High humidity can often have a negative effect on the capacity of chemical plants and refineries that use furnaces as part of the process (e.g. [[steam reforming]], [[wet sulfuric acid process]]).  The humidity will reduce the oxygen concentration, and the flue gas fans have to pull more air through the system to get the same firing rate (dry air is 20.9% Oxygen, at 100% relative humidity, the air is 20.4% oxygen).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.industrialcontrolsonline.com/training/online/everything-you-need-know-about-combustion-chemistry-analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Thermodynamics|cTopic='''[[Material properties (thermodynamics)|Material properties]]'''}}
'''Heat capacity''' or '''thermal capacity''' is a [[measurement|measurable]] [[physical quantity]] equal to the ratio of the [[heat]] added to (or removed from) an object to the resulting [[temperature]] change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halliday|first1=David|last2=Resnick|first2=Robert|title=Fundamentals of Physics|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|page=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of heat capacity is [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\tfrac{J}{K}}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[dimensional analysis|dimensional form]] is {{math|{{dimanalysis|length=2|mass=1|time=−2|temp=−1|}}}}. Specific heat is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a certain [[mass]] by 1 degree Celsius.

Heat capacity is an [[extensive property]] of matter, meaning it is proportional to the size of the system. When expressing the same phenomenon as an [[intensive property]], the heat capacity is divided by the amount of substance, mass, or volume, so that the quantity is independent of the size or extent of the sample.  The '''molar heat capacity''' is the heat capacity per unit amount (SI unit: [[Mole (unit)|mole]]) of a pure substance and the '''specific heat capacity''', often simply called '''specific heat''', is the heat capacity per unit mass of a material. Occasionally, in engineering contexts, the [[volumetric heat capacity]] is used.

[[Temperature]] reflects the average randomized kinetic [[energy]] of constituent particles of matter (e.g. atoms or molecules) relative to the centre of mass of the system, while heat is the transfer of energy across a system boundary into the body other than by work or matter transfer. Translation, rotation, and vibration of atoms represent the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of motion which classically contribute to the heat capacity of gases, while only vibrations are needed to describe the heat capacities of most solids &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Charles | last = Kittel | author-link = Charles Kittel| title = Introduction to Solid State Physics | place = Hoboken, New Jesery, USA

degrees of freedom in solids, but these rarely make substantial contributions.

For quantum mechanical reasons, at any given temperature, some of these degrees of freedom may be unavailable, or only partially available, to store thermal energy. In such cases, the specific heat capacity is a fraction of the maximum. As the temperature approaches [[absolute zero]], the specific heat capacity of a system approaches zero, due to loss of available degrees of freedom. [[Quantum mechanics|Quantum theory]] can be used to quantitatively predict the specific heat capacity of simple systems.

== History ==
{{Main|History of heat}}
In a previous theory of heat common in the [[early modern period]], heat was thought to be a measurement of an invisible fluid, known as the ''[[caloric theory|caloric]]''.  Bodies were capable of holding a certain amount of this fluid, hence the term ''heat capacity'', named and first investigated by [[Scotland|Scottish]] chemist [[Joseph Black]] in the 1750s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laider&quot;&gt;{{cite book
 |last= Laider|first= Keith J.
 |year=1993
 |title=The World of Physical Chemistry
 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=01LRlPbH80cC&amp;printsec=frontcover
 |publisher=Oxford University Press
 |isbn=0-19-855919-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the development of [[thermodynamics]] during the 18th and 19th centuries, scientists have abandoned the idea of a physical caloric, and instead understand [[heat]] as changes in a system's [[internal energy]]. That is, heat is no longer considered a fluid; rather, heat is a transfer of disordered energy. Nevertheless, at least in English, the term &quot;heat capacity&quot; survives. In some other languages, the term ''thermal capacity'' is preferred, and it is also sometimes used in English.

== Units ==

=== Extensive properties ===
In the International System of Units, heat capacity has the unit joules per kelvin. An object's heat capacity (symbol ''C'') is defined as the ratio of the amount of heat energy transferred to an object and the resulting increase in temperature of the object,
: &lt;math&gt; C \equiv \frac{ Q}{\Delta T}, &lt;/math&gt;
assuming that the temperature range is sufficiently small so that the heat capacity is constant. More generally, because heat capacity does depend upon temperature, it should be written as
: &lt;math&gt; C (T) \equiv \frac{\delta Q}{d T}, &lt;/math&gt;
where the symbol ''δ'' is used to imply that heat is a [[path function]]. Heat capacity is an [[extensive property]], meaning it depends on the extent or size of the physical system in question. A sample containing twice the amount of substance as another sample requires the transfer of twice the amount of heat (&lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;) to achieve the same change in temperature (&lt;math&gt; \Delta T &lt;/math&gt;).

=== Intensive properties ===
For many experimental and theoretical purposes it is more convenient to report heat capacity as an [[intensive property]] – an intrinsic characteristic of a particular substance. This is most often accomplished by expressing the property in relation to a unit of [[mass]]. In science and engineering, such properties are often prefixed with the term ''specific''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|author=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, Physical Chemistry Division
|publisher=Blackwell Sciences
|page=7
|quote=The adjective specific before the name of an extensive quantity is often used to mean divided by mass.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; International standards now recommend that specific heat capacity always refer to division by mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The units for the '''specific heat capacity''' are &lt;math&gt;[c] = \mathrm{\tfrac{J}{kg \cdot K}}&lt;/math&gt;.

In chemistry, heat capacity is often specified relative to one mole, the unit of [[amount of substance]], and is called the '''molar heat capacity'''. It has the unit &lt;math&gt; [C_\mathrm{mol}] =\mathrm{\tfrac{J}{mol \cdot K}}&lt;/math&gt;.

For some considerations it is useful to specify the volume-specific heat capacity, commonly called [[volumetric heat capacity]], which is the heat capacity per unit volume and has SI units &lt;math&gt;[s] = \mathrm{\tfrac{J}{m^{3} \cdot K}}&lt;/math&gt;. This is used almost exclusively for liquids and solids, since for gases it may be confused with specific heat capacity ''at constant volume''.

=== Alternative unit systems ===
While SI units are the most widely used, some countries and industries also use other systems of measurement. One older unit of heat is the [[calorie|kilogram-calorie]] (Cal), originally defined as the energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius, typically from 14.5 to 15.5&amp;nbsp;°C.  The specific average heat capacity of water on this scale would therefore be exactly 1&amp;nbsp;Cal/(C°⋅kg).  However, due to the temperature-dependence of the specific heat, a large number of different definitions of the calorie came into being. Whilst once it was very prevalent, especially its smaller [[cgs]] variant the gram-calorie (cal), defined so that the specific heat of water would be 1&amp;nbsp;cal/(K⋅g), in most fields the use of the calorie is now archaic.

In the United States other units of measure for heat capacity may be quoted in disciplines such as [[construction]], [[civil engineering]], and [[chemical engineering]]. A still common system is the [[English Engineering Units]] in which the mass reference is [[Pound (mass)|pound mass]] and the temperature is specified in [[Fahrenheit|degrees Fahrenheit]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]]. One (rare) unit of heat is the pound calorie (lb-cal), defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Celsius. On this scale the specific heat of water would be 1&amp;nbsp;lb-cal/(K⋅lb).  More common is the [[British thermal unit]], the standard unit of heat in the U.S. construction industry. This is defined such that the specific heat of water is 1 BTU/(F°⋅lb).

== Measurement of heat capacity ==
It may appear that the way to measure heat capacity is to add a known amount of heat to an object, and measure the change in temperature. This works reasonably well for many solids. However, for precise measurements, and especially for gasses, other aspects of measurement become critical.

The heat capacity can be affected by many of the [[state variable]]s that describe the thermodynamic system under study. These include the starting and ending temperature, as well as the pressure and the volume of the system before and after heat is added. So rather than a single way to measure heat capacity, there are actually several slightly different measurements of heat capacity. The most commonly used methods for measurement are to hold the object either at constant [[pressure]] (''C''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) or at constant [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] (''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Gas]]es and [[liquid]]s are typically also measured at constant volume. Measurements under constant pressure produce larger values than those at constant volume because the constant pressure values also include heat energy that is used to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] to expand the substance against the constant pressure as its temperature increases. This difference is particularly notable in gases where values under constant pressure are typically 30% to 66.7% greater than those at constant volume. Hence the [[heat capacity ratio]] of gases is typically between 1.3 and 1.67.&lt;ref name=Lange&gt;Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, 10th ed. page 1524&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific heat capacities of substances comprising molecules (as distinct from [[monatomic]] gases) are not fixed constants and vary somewhat depending on temperature. Accordingly, the temperature at which the measurement is made is usually also specified. Examples of two common ways to cite the specific heat of a substance are as follows:&lt;ref name=toolbox&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/water-thermal-properties-d_162.html |title=Water – Thermal Properties |publisher=Engineeringtoolbox.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Water (liquid): ''C''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = 4185.5&amp;nbsp;J/(kg⋅K) (15&amp;nbsp;°C, 101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa)
* Water (liquid): ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' = 74.539&amp;nbsp;J/(mol⋅K) (25&amp;nbsp;°C)

For liquids and gases, it is important to know the pressure to which given heat capacity data refer. Most published data are given for standard pressure. However, quite different [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] have been defined by different organizations. The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) changed its recommendation from one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] to the round value 100 kPa (≈750.062 Torr).&lt;ref group=notes&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=S05921|title= Standard Pressure}}. Besides being a round number, this had a very practical effect: relatively few {{Quantify|date=August 2008}} people live and work at precisely sea level; 100 kPa equates to the mean pressure at an altitude of about 112 metres (which is closer to the 194–metre, world–wide median altitude of human habitation{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calculation from first principles ===
The [[path integral Monte Carlo]] method is a numerical approach for determining the values of heat capacity, based on quantum dynamical principles. However, good approximations can be made for gases in many states using simpler methods outlined below. For many solids composed of relatively heavy atoms (atomic number &gt; iron), at non-cryogenic temperatures, the heat capacity at room temperature approaches 3''R'' = 24.94 joules per kelvin per mole of atoms ([[Dulong–Petit law]], ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]). Low temperature approximations for both gases and solids at temperatures less than their characteristic [[Einstein temperature]]s or [[Debye temperature]]s can be made by the methods of Einstein and Debye discussed below.

=== Thermodynamic relations and definition of heat capacity {{anchor|Heat capacity}} ===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ideal gas]] --&gt;

The internal energy of a closed system changes either by adding heat to the system or by the system performing work. Written mathematically we have

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta e_\text{system} = e _\text{in} - e_\text{out} &lt;/math&gt;

Or

:&lt;math&gt;{\ \text{d}U = \delta Q - \delta W }.&lt;/math&gt;

For work as a result of an increase of the system volume we may write,

:&lt;math&gt;{\ \text{d}U = \delta Q - P\text{d}V }.&lt;/math&gt;

If the heat is added at constant volume, then the second term of this relation vanishes and one readily obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_\text{V}=\left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial T}\right)_\text{V} = C_\text{V}. &lt;/math&gt;

This defines the ''heat capacity at constant volume'', ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also related to changes in internal energy. Another useful quantity is the ''heat capacity at constant pressure'', ''C''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;. This quantity refers to the change in the ''enthalpy'' of the system, which is given by

:&lt;math&gt;{\ H = U + PV }.&lt;/math&gt;

A small change in the enthalpy can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;{\ \text{d}H = \delta Q + V \text{d}P },&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore, at constant pressure, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_\text{P} = \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial T}\right)_\text{P} = C_\text{P}.&lt;/math&gt;

These two equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_\text{V} = \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial T}\right)_\text{V} = C_\text{V}. &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_\text{P} = \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial T}\right)_\text{P}  =C_\text{P}.&lt;/math&gt;

are property relations and are therefore independent of the type of process. In other words, they are valid for any substance going through any process. Both the internal energy and enthalpy of a substance can change with the transfer of energy in many forms i.e., heat.&lt;ref&gt;''Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach'' by Yunus A. Cengal and Michael A. Boles&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation between heat capacities ===
{{Main|Relations between heat capacities}}
Measuring the heat capacity, sometimes referred to as specific heat, at constant volume can be prohibitively difficult for liquids and solids. That is, small temperature changes typically require large pressures to maintain a liquid or solid at constant volume implying the containing vessel must be nearly rigid or at least very strong (see [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] and [[compressibility]]). Instead it is easier to measure the heat capacity at constant pressure (allowing the material to expand or contract freely) and solve for the heat capacity at constant volume using mathematical relationships derived from the basic thermodynamic laws. Starting from the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] one can show
:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{P} - C_\text{V} = T \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_\text{V,n} \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_\text{P,n}&lt;/math&gt;
where the partial derivatives are taken at constant volume and constant number of particles, and constant pressure and constant number of particles, respectively.

This can also be rewritten
:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{P} - C_\text{V} = V T\frac{\alpha^2}{\beta_\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]],
:&lt;math&gt;\beta_\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[isothermal]] [[compressibility]].

The [[heat capacity ratio]] or adiabatic index is the ratio of the heat capacity at constant pressure to heat capacity at constant volume. It is sometimes also known as the isentropic expansion factor.

==== Ideal gas ====
&lt;ref&gt;Yunus A. Cengel and Michael A. Boles,Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach   7th Edition, , McGraw-Hill, 2010,ISBN 007-352932-X&lt;/ref&gt;
For an [[ideal gas]], evaluating the partial derivatives above according to the [[equation of state]] where R is the [[gas constant]] for an ideal gas
:&lt;math&gt;P V = n R T&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{P} - C_\text{V} = T \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_\text{V,n} \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_\text{P,n}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{nRT}{V}\Rightarrow \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_\text{V,n}=\frac{nR}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V =\frac{nRT}{P} \Rightarrow \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_\text{P,n}=\frac{nR}{P}&lt;/math&gt;
substituting
:&lt;math&gt;T \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_\text{V,n} \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_\text{P,n}  = T\left(\frac{nR}{V}\right) \left(\frac{nR}{P}\right) = \left(\frac{nRT}{V}\right)\left(\frac{nR}{P}\right) = P\left(\frac{nR}{P}\right) =nR&lt;/math&gt;

this equation reduces simply to [[Julius Robert von Mayer|Mayer]]'s relation,

:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{P,m} - C_\text{V,m} = R&lt;/math&gt;

=== Specific heat capacity ===
The specific heat capacity of a material on a per mass basis is

:&lt;math&gt;c = {\partial C \over \partial m},&lt;/math&gt;

which in the absence of phase transitions is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;c = E_\text{m} = {C \over m} = {C \over {\rho V}},&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the heat capacity of a body made of the material in question,
:&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the body,
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the body, and
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{m}{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the material.

For gases, and also for other materials under high pressures, there is need to distinguish between different boundary conditions for the processes under consideration (since values differ significantly between different conditions). Typical processes for which a heat capacity may be defined include [[Isobaric process|isobaric]] (constant pressure, &lt;math&gt;\text{d}P = 0&lt;/math&gt;) or [[isochoric process|isochoric]] (constant volume, &lt;math&gt;\text{d}V = 0&lt;/math&gt;) processes. The corresponding specific heat capacities are expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;c_\text{P} = \left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial m}\right)_\text{P},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_\text{V} = \left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial m}\right)_\text{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the results of the previous section, dividing through by the mass gives the relation

:&lt;math&gt;c_\text{P} - c_\text{V} = \frac{\alpha^2 T}{\rho \beta_\text{T}}.&lt;/math&gt;

A related parameter to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;CV^{-1}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the [[volumetric heat capacity]]. In engineering practice, &lt;math&gt;c_\text{V}\,&lt;/math&gt; for solids or liquids often signifies a volumetric heat capacity, rather than a constant-volume one. In such cases, the mass-specific heat capacity (specific heat) is often explicitly written with the subscript &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;c_\text{m}\,&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, from the above relationships, for solids one writes

:&lt;math&gt; c_\text{m} = \frac{C}{m} = \frac{c_\text{volumetric}}{\rho}.&lt;/math&gt;

For pure homogeneous [[chemical compound]]s with established [[molecular mass|molecular or molar mass]] or a [[mole (chemistry)|molar quantity]] is established, heat capacity as an [[intensive property]] can be expressed on a per [[mole (chemistry)|mole]] basis instead of a per mass basis by the following equations analogous to the per mass equations:

:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{P,m} = \left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial n}\right)_\text{P}&lt;/math&gt; = molar heat capacity at constant pressure

:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{V,m} = \left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial n}\right)_\text{V}&lt;/math&gt; = molar heat capacity at constant volume

where ''n'' is the number of moles in the body or [[thermodynamic system]]. One may refer to such a ''per mole'' quantity as molar heat capacity to distinguish it from specific heat capacity on a per mass basis.

=== Polytropic heat capacity ===
The [[polytropic]] heat capacity is calculated at processes if all the thermodynamic properties (pressure, volume, temperature) change

:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{i,m} = \left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial n}\right)&lt;/math&gt; = molar heat capacity at polytropic process

The most important polytropic processes run between the adiabatic and the isotherm functions, the polytropic index is between '''1''' and the adiabatic exponent (γ or κ)

===Dimensionless heat capacity===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dulong–Petit law]] --&gt;
The [[dimensionless number|dimensionless]] heat capacity of a material is
:&lt;math&gt;C^* = {C \over nR} = {C \over Nk}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''C'' is the heat capacity of a body made of the material in question (J/K)
:''n'' is the [[amount of substance]] in the body ([[mole (unit)|mol]])
:''R'' is the [[gas constant]] (J/(K⋅mol))
:''N'' is the number of molecules in the body. (dimensionless)
:''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant|Boltzmann’s constant]] (J/(K⋅molecule))

In the [[ideal gas]] article, dimensionless heat capacity &lt;math&gt; C^* \,&lt;/math&gt; is expressed as &lt;math&gt; \hat c &lt;/math&gt;, and is related there directly to half the number of degrees of freedom per particle.  This holds true for quadratic degrees of freedom, a consequence of the [[equipartition theorem]].

More generally, the dimensionless heat capacity relates the logarithmic increase in temperature to the increase in the [[dimensionless entropy]] per particle &lt;math&gt; S^* = S / Nk &lt;/math&gt;, measured in [[nat (unit)|nats]].
:&lt;math&gt;C^* = {\text{d} S^* \over \text{d} \ln T}&lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively, using base 2 logarithms, ''C''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; relates the base-2 logarithmic increase in temperature to the increase in the dimensionless entropy measured in [[bit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1119/1.1593658|title=Heat capacity in bits|year=2003|last1=Fraundorf|first1=P.|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=71|page=1142|bibcode = 2003AmJPh..71.1142F|issue=11 |arxiv=cond-mat/9711074 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heat capacity at absolute zero ===
From the definition of [[Entropy#Thermodynamic definition of entropy|entropy]]

:&lt;math&gt;T \, \text{d}S=\delta Q\,&lt;/math&gt;

the absolute entropy can be calculated by integrating from zero kelvins temperature to the final temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S(T_\text{f})=\int_{T=0}^{T_\text{f}} \frac{\delta Q}{T}
=\int_0^{T_\text{f}} \frac{\delta Q}{\text{d}T}\frac{\text{d}T}{T}
=\int_0^{T_\text{f}} C(T)\,\frac{\text{d}T}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

The heat capacity must be zero at zero temperature in order for the above integral not to yield an infinite absolute entropy, which would violate the [[third law of thermodynamics]]. One of the strengths of the [[Debye model]] is that (unlike the preceding Einstein model) it predicts the proper mathematical form of the approach of heat capacity toward zero, as absolute zero temperature is approached.

=== Negative heat capacity (stars) ===
Most physical systems exhibit a positive heat capacity.  However, even though it can seem paradoxical at first,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=D. Lynden-Bell &amp; R. M. Lynden-Bell |date=Nov 1977|bibcode=1977MNRAS.181..405L |title=On the negative specific heat paradox|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=181|pages=405–419 |doi=10.1093/mnras/181.3.405}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=D. |last=Lynden-Bell |date=Dec 1998|title= Negative Specific Heat in Astronomy, Physics and Chemistry|id=|arxiv=cond-mat/9812172v1|bibcode = 1999PhyA..263..293L |doi = 10.1016/S0378-4371(98)00518-4 |journal=Physica A|volume=263|pages=293–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are some systems for which the heat capacity is ''negative''.  These
are inhomogeneous systems which do not meet the strict definition of thermodynamic equilibrium. They include gravitating objects such as stars, galaxies; and also sometimes some [[nanoscopic scale|nano-scale]] clusters of a few tens of atoms, close to a phase transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Schmidt| first1=Martin| last2=Kusche| first2=Robert| last3=Hippler| first3=Thomas| last4=Donges| first4=Jörn| last5=Kronmüller| first5=Werner| last6=Issendorff, von| first6=Bernd| last7=Haberland| first7=Hellmut| title=Negative Heat Capacity for a Cluster of 147 Sodium Atoms| journal=Physical Review Letters| volume=86| issue=7| pages=1191–4| year=2001| pmid=11178041| doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.1191| bibcode=2001PhRvL..86.1191S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A negative heat capacity can result in a [[negative temperature]].

According to the [[virial theorem]], for a self-gravitating body like a star or an interstellar gas cloud, the average potential energy ''U''&lt;sub&gt;Pot&lt;/sub&gt; and the average kinetic energy ''U''&lt;sub&gt;Kin&lt;/sub&gt; are locked together in the relation

:&lt;math&gt;U_\text{Pot} = -2 U_\text{Kin}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

The total energy ''U'' (= ''U''&lt;sub&gt;Pot&lt;/sub&gt; + ''U''&lt;sub&gt;Kin&lt;/sub&gt;) therefore obeys

:&lt;math&gt;U = - U_\text{Kin}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

If the system loses energy, for example by radiating energy away into space, the average kinetic energy actually increases.  If a temperature is defined by the average kinetic energy, then the system therefore can be said to have a negative heat capacity.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., {{cite journal|first=David |last=Wallace|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00004744/01/gravent_archive.pdf|title= Gravity, entropy, and cosmology: in search of clarity|journal=British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|doi=10.1093/bjps/axp048|format=preprint|year=2010|volume=61|issue=3|page=513|bibcode = 2010BJPS...61..513W |arxiv = 0907.0659 }} Section 4 and onwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more extreme version of this occurs with [[black hole]]s.  According to [[black hole thermodynamics]], the more mass and energy a black hole absorbs, the colder it becomes. In contrast, if it is a net emitter of energy, through [[Hawking radiation]], it will become hotter and hotter until it boils away.

but not to its temperature. More internal degrees of freedom tend to increase a substance's specific heat capacity, so long as temperatures are high enough to overcome quantum effects.]]

For any given substance, the heat capacity of a body is directly proportional to the amount of substance it contains (measured in terms of mass or moles or volume). Doubling the amount of substance in a body doubles its heat capacity, etc.

However, when this effect has been corrected for, by dividing the heat capacity by the quantity of substance in a body, the resulting [[specific heat capacity]] is a function of the structure of the substance itself. In particular, it depends on the number of [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] that are available to the particles in the substance; each independent degree of freedom allows the particles to store thermal energy. The translational [[kinetic energy]] of substance particles is only one of the many possible degrees of freedom which manifests as ''temperature change'', and thus the larger the number of degrees of freedom available to the particles of a substance ''other'' than translational kinetic energy, the larger will be the specific heat capacity for the substance. For example, rotational kinetic energy of gas molecules stores heat energy in a way that increases heat capacity, since this energy does not contribute to temperature.

In addition, quantum effects require that whenever energy be stored in any mechanism associated with a bound system which confers a degree of freedom, it must be stored in certain minimal-sized deposits (quanta) of energy, or else not stored at all. Such effects limit the full ability of some degrees of freedom to store energy when their lowest energy storage quantum amount is not easily supplied at the average energy of particles at a given temperature. In general, for this reason, specific heat capacities tend to fall at lower temperatures where the average thermal energy available to each particle degree of freedom is smaller, and thermal energy storage begins to be limited by these quantum effects. Due to this process, as temperature falls toward absolute zero, so also does heat capacity.

==== Degrees of freedom ====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
{{Main|degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)}}
Molecules are quite different from the [[monatomic]] gases like [[helium]] and [[argon]]. With monatomic gases, thermal energy comprises only translational motions. Translational motions are ordinary, whole-body movements in [[Three-dimensional space|3D space]] whereby particles move about and exchange energy in collisions—like rubber balls in a vigorously shaken container (see animation here &lt;ref&gt;[[Media:Translational motion.gif]]&lt;/ref&gt;). These simple movements in the three dimensions of space mean individual atoms have three translational [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. A degree of freedom is any form of energy in which heat transferred into an object can be stored. This can be in [[translational kinetic energy]], [[rotational kinetic energy]], or other forms such as [[potential energy]] in [[vibrational modes]]. Only three translational degrees of freedom (corresponding to the three independent directions in space) are available for any individual atom, whether it is free, as a monatomic molecule, or bound into a polyatomic molecule.

As to rotation about an atom's axis (again, whether the atom is bound or free), its energy of rotation is proportional to the [[moment of inertia]] for the atom, which is extremely small compared to moments of inertia of collections of atoms. This is because almost all of the mass of a single atom is concentrated in its nucleus, which has a [[nuclear radius|radius]] too small to give a significant moment of inertia. In contrast, the ''spacing'' of quantum energy levels for a rotating object is inversely proportional to its moment of inertia, and so this spacing becomes very large for objects with very small moments of inertia. For these reasons, the contribution from rotation of atoms on their axes is essentially zero in monatomic gases, because the energy spacing of the associated quantum levels is too large for significant thermal energy to be stored in rotation of systems with such small moments of inertia. For similar reasons, axial rotation around bonds joining atoms in diatomic gases (or along the linear axis in a linear molecule of any length) can also be neglected as a possible &quot;degree of freedom&quot; as well, since such rotation is similar to rotation of monatomic atoms, and so occurs about an axis with a moment of inertia too small to be able to store significant heat energy.

In polyatomic molecules, other rotational modes may become active, due to the much higher moments of inertia about certain axes which do not coincide with the linear axis of a linear molecule. These modes take the place of some translational degrees of freedom for individual atoms, since the atoms are moving in 3-D space, as the molecule rotates. The narrowing of quantum mechanically determined energy spacing between rotational states results from situations where atoms are rotating around an axis that does not connect them, and thus form an assembly that has a large moment of inertia. This small difference between energy states allows the kinetic energy of this type of rotational motion to store heat energy at ambient temperatures. Furthermore, internal vibrational degrees of freedom also may become active (these are also a type of translation, as seen from the view of each atom). In summary, molecules are complex objects with a population of atoms that may move about within the molecule in a number of different ways (see animation at right), and each of these ways of moving is capable of storing energy if the temperature is sufficient.

The heat capacity of molecular substances (on a &quot;per-atom&quot; or atom-molar, basis) does not exceed the heat capacity of monatomic gases, unless vibrational modes are brought into play. The reason for this is that vibrational modes allow energy to be stored as potential energy in intra-atomic bonds in a molecule, which are not available to atoms in monatomic gases. Up to about twice as much energy (on a per-atom basis) per unit of temperature increase can be stored in a solid as in a monatomic gas, by this mechanism of storing energy in the potentials of interatomic bonds. This gives many solids about twice the atom-molar heat capacity at room temperature of monatomic gases.

However, quantum effects heavily affect the actual ratio at lower temperatures (i.e., much lower than the melting temperature of the solid), especially in solids with light and tightly bound atoms (e.g., beryllium metal or diamond). Polyatomic gases store intermediate amounts of energy, giving them a &quot;per-atom&quot; heat capacity that is between that of monatomic gases ({{frac|3|2}} ''R'' per mole of atoms, where ''R'' is the [[ideal gas constant]]), and the maximum of fully excited warmer solids (3 ''R'' per mole of atoms). For gases, heat capacity never falls below the minimum of {{frac|3|2}} ''R'' per mole (of molecules), since the kinetic energy of gas molecules is always available to store at least this much thermal energy. However, at cryogenic temperatures in solids, heat capacity falls toward zero, as temperature approaches absolute zero.

==== Example of temperature-dependent specific heat capacity, in a diatomic gas ====
To illustrate the role of various degrees of freedom in storing heat, we may consider [[nitrogen]], a [[diatomic]] molecule that has five active degrees of freedom at room temperature: the three comprising translational motion plus two rotational degrees of freedom internally. Although the constant-volume molar heat capacity of nitrogen at this temperature is five-thirds that of monatomic gases, on a per-mole of atoms basis, it is five-sixths that of a monatomic gas. The reason for this is the loss of a degree of freedom due to the bond when it does not allow storage of thermal energy. Two separate nitrogen atoms would have a total of six degrees of freedom—the three translational degrees of freedom of each atom. When the atoms are bonded the molecule will still only have three translational degrees of freedom, as the two atoms in the molecule move as one. However, the molecule cannot be treated as a point object, and the moment of inertia has increased sufficiently about two axes to allow two rotational degrees of freedom to be active at room temperature to give five degrees of freedom. The moment of inertia about the third axis remains small, as this is the axis passing through the centres of the two atoms, and so is similar to the small moment of inertia for atoms of a monatomic gas. Thus, this degree of freedom does not act to store heat, and does not contribute to the heat capacity of nitrogen. The heat capacity ''per atom'' for nitrogen (5/2 per mole molecules = 5/4 per mole atoms) is therefore less than for a monatomic gas (3/2 per mole molecules or atoms), so long as the temperature remains low enough that no vibrational degrees of freedom are activated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Physics and the Physics of large systems, Part 1A Physics|publisher=University of Cambridge|first=C. G. |last=Smith|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At higher temperatures, however, nitrogen gas gains two more degrees of internal freedom, as the molecule is excited into higher vibrational modes that store thermal energy. Now the bond is contributing heat capacity, and is contributing more than if the atoms were not bonded. With full thermal excitation of bond vibration, the heat capacity per volume, or per mole of gas ''molecules'' approaches seven-thirds that of monatomic gases. Significantly, this is seven-sixths of the monatomic gas value on a mole-of-atoms basis, so this is now a ''higher'' heat capacity ''per atom'' than the monatomic figure, because the vibrational mode enables for diatomic gases allows an extra degree of ''potential energy'' freedom per pair of atoms, which monatomic gases cannot possess.&lt;ref&gt;The&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;comparison must be made under constant-volume conditions—''C&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;H''—so that no work is performed. Nitrogen’s ''C&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;H'' (100&amp;nbsp;kPa, 20&amp;nbsp;°C) = 20.8&amp;nbsp;J&amp;nbsp;mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; vs. the monatomic gases which equal 12.4717&amp;nbsp;J&amp;nbsp;mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Citations: {{cite web|first= W. H. | last=Freeman’s | title=Physical Chemistry Part 3: Change Exercise 21.20b, Pg.&amp;nbsp;787 | url=http://www.whfreeman.com/college/pdfs/pchem8e/PC8eC21.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Georgia State University|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/shegas.html |title=Molar Specific Heats of Gases}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[thermodynamic temperature]] for more information on translational motions, kinetic (heat) energy, and their relationship to temperature.

However, even at these large temperatures where gaseous nitrogen is able to store 7/6&lt;sup&gt;ths&lt;/sup&gt; of the energy ''per atom'' of a monatomic gas (making it more efficient at storing energy on an atomic basis), it still only stores 7/12 &lt;sup&gt;ths&lt;/sup&gt; of the maximal per-atom heat capacity of a ''solid,'' meaning it is not nearly as efficient at storing thermal energy on an atomic basis, as solid substances can be. This is typical of gases, and results because many of the potential bonds which might be storing potential energy in gaseous nitrogen (as opposed to solid nitrogen) are lacking, because only one of the spatial dimensions for each nitrogen atom offers a bond into which potential energy can be stored without increasing the kinetic energy of the atom. In general, solids are most efficient, on an atomic basis, at storing thermal energy (that is, they have the highest per-atom or per-mole-of-atoms heat capacity).

==== Per mole of different units ====

===== Per mole of molecules =====
When the specific heat capacity, ''c'', of a material is measured (lowercase ''c'' means the unit quantity is in terms of mass), different values arise because different substances have different [[molar mass]]es (essentially, the weight of the individual atoms or molecules). In solids, thermal energy arises due to the number of atoms that are vibrating. &quot;Molar&quot; heat capacity ''per mole of molecules'', for both gases and solids, offer figures which are arbitrarily large, since molecules may be arbitrarily large. Such heat capacities are thus not intensive quantities for this reason, since the quantity of mass being considered can be increased without limit.

===== Per mole of atoms =====
Conversely, for ''molecular-based'' substances (which also absorb heat into their internal degrees of freedom), massive, complex molecules with high atomic count—like octane—can store a great deal of energy per mole and yet are quite unremarkable on a mass basis, or on a per-atom basis. This is because, in fully excited systems, heat is stored independently by each atom in a substance, not primarily by the bulk motion of molecules.

Thus, it is the heat capacity per-mole-of-atoms, not per-mole-of-molecules, which is the intensive quantity, and which comes closest to being a constant for all substances at high temperatures. This relationship was noticed empirically in 1819, and is called the [[Dulong–Petit law]], after its two discoverers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Petit A.-T., Dulong P.-L.| title=Recherches sur quelques points importants de la Théorie de la Chaleur|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|volume=10|pages= 395–413 |year=1819|url=http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/PETIT.html Translation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the fact that specific heat capacities are approximately equal when corrected by the presumed weight of the atoms of solids, was an important piece of data in favor of the atomic theory of matter.

Because of the connection of heat capacity to the number of atoms, some care should be taken to specify a mole-of-molecules basis vs. a mole-of-atoms basis, when comparing specific heat capacities of molecular solids and gases. Ideal gases have the same numbers of molecules per volume, so increasing molecular complexity adds heat capacity on a per-volume and per-mole-of-molecules basis, but may lower or raise heat capacity on a per-atom basis, depending on whether the temperature is sufficient to store energy as atomic vibration.

In solids, the quantitative limit of heat capacity in general is about 3 ''R'' per mole of atoms, where ''R'' is the [[ideal gas constant]]. This 3 ''R'' value is about 24.9 J/mole.K. Six degrees of freedom (three kinetic and three potential) are available to each atom. Each of these six contributes {{frac|2}}R specific heat capacity per mole of atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruelle.phys.unsw.edu.au/~gary/PHYS3020_files/SM3_6.pdf |title=The Heat Capacity of a Solid}}&lt;/ref&gt; This limit of 3 ''R'' per mole specific heat capacity is approached at room temperature for most solids, with significant departures at this temperature only for solids composed of the lightest atoms which are bound very strongly, such as [[beryllium]] (where the value is only of 66% of 3 ''R''), or diamond (where it is only 24% of 3 ''R''). These large departures are due to quantum effects which prevent full distribution of heat into all vibrational modes, when the energy difference between vibrational quantum states is very large compared to the average energy available to each atom from the ambient temperature.

For monatomic gases, the specific heat is only half of 3 ''R'' per mole, i.e. ({{frac|3|2}}R per mole) due to loss of all potential energy degrees of freedom in these gases. For polyatomic gases, the heat capacity will be intermediate between these values on a per-mole-of-atoms basis, and (for heat-stable molecules) would approach the limit of 3 ''R'' per mole of atoms, for gases composed of complex molecules, and at higher temperatures at which all vibrational modes accept excitational energy. This is because very large and complex gas molecules may be thought of as relatively large blocks of solid matter which have lost only a relatively small fraction of degrees of freedom, as compared to a fully integrated solid.

For a list of heat capacities per atom-mole of various substances, in terms of R, see the last column of the table of heat capacities below.

==== Corollaries of these considerations for solids (volume-specific heat capacity) ====
Since&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;the [[bulk density]] of a solid chemical element is strongly related to its molar mass (usually about 3 ''R'' per mole, as noted above), there exists a noticeable inverse correlation between a solid’s density and its specific heat capacity on a per-mass basis. This is due to a very approximate tendency of atoms of most elements to be about the same size, and constancy of mole-specific heat capacity) result in a good correlation between the ''volume'' of any given solid chemical element and its total heat capacity. Another way of stating this, is that the volume-specific heat capacity ([[volumetric heat capacity]]) of solid elements is roughly a constant. The [[molar volume]] of solid elements is very roughly constant, and (even more reliably) so also is the molar heat capacity for most solid substances. These two factors determine the volumetric heat capacity, which as a bulk property may be striking in consistency. For example, the element uranium is a metal which has a density almost 36 times that of the metal lithium, but uranium's specific heat capacity on a volumetric basis (i.e. per given volume of metal) is only 18% larger than lithium's.

Since the volume-specific corollary of the Dulong–Petit specific heat capacity relationship requires that atoms of all elements take up (on average) the same volume in solids, there are many departures from it, with most of these due to variations in atomic size. For instance, [[arsenic]], which is only 14.5% less dense than [[antimony]], has nearly 59% more specific heat capacity on a mass basis. In other words; even though an ingot of arsenic is only about 17% larger than an antimony one of the same mass, it absorbs about 59% more heat for a given temperature rise. The heat capacity ratios of the two substances closely follows the ratios of their molar volumes (the ratios of numbers of atoms in the same volume of each substance); the departure from the correlation to simple volumes in this case is due to lighter arsenic atoms being significantly more closely packed than antimony atoms, instead of similar size. In other words, similar-sized atoms would cause a mole of arsenic to be 63% larger than a mole of antimony, with a correspondingly lower density, allowing its volume to more closely mirror its heat capacity behavior.

==== Other factors ====

===== Hydrogen bonds =====
Hydrogen-containing [[Chemical polarity|polar]] molecules like [[ethanol]], [[ammonia]], and [[water]] have powerful, intermolecular [[hydrogen bond]]s when in their liquid phase. These bonds provide another place where heat may be stored as potential energy of vibration, even at comparatively low temperatures. Hydrogen bonds account for the fact that liquid water stores nearly the theoretical limit of 3 ''R'' per mole of atoms, even at relatively low temperatures (i.e. near the freezing point of water).

===== Impurities =====
In the case of alloys, there are several conditions in which small impurity concentrations can greatly affect the specific heat. Alloys may exhibit marked difference in behaviour even in the case of small amounts of impurities being one element of the alloy; for example impurities in semiconducting [[ferromagnetic]] alloys may lead to quite different specific heat properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.188.870|title=Density of States of an Insulating Ferromagnetic Alloy|year=1969|last1=Hogan|first1=C.|journal=Physical Review|volume=188|page=870|bibcode = 1969PhRv..188..870H|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The simple case of the monatomic gas ===
In the case of a monatomic gas such as [[helium]] under constant volume, if it is assumed that no electronic or nuclear quantum excitations occur, each atom in the gas has only 3 [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], all of a translational type. No energy dependence is associated with the degrees of freedom which define the position of the atoms. While, in fact, the degrees of freedom corresponding to the [[momentum|momenta]] of the atoms are quadratic, and thus contribute to the heat capacity. There are ''N'' atoms, each of which has 3 components of momentum, which leads to 3''N'' total degrees of freedom. This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;C_V=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_V=\frac{3}{2}N\,k_B =\frac{3}{2}n\,R&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_{V,m}=\frac{C_V}{n}=\frac{3}{2}R&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt; is the heat capacity at constant volume of the gas
:&lt;math&gt;C_{V,m}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''molar heat capacity'' at constant volume of the gas
:''N'' is the total number of atoms present in the container
:''n'' is the number of [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of atoms present in the container (''n'' is the ratio of ''N'' and [[Avogadro's number|Avogadro’s number]])
:''R'' is the [[ideal gas constant]], (8.3144621[75] J/(mol⋅K). ''R'' is equal to the product of [[Boltzmann's constant|Boltzmann’s constant]] &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; and Avogadro’s number

The following table shows experimental molar constant volume heat capacity measurements taken for each noble monatomic gas (at 1 atm and 25&amp;nbsp;°C):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

It is apparent from the table that the experimental heat capacities of the monatomic noble gases agrees with this simple application of statistical mechanics to a very high degree.

The molar heat capacity of a monatomic gas at constant pressure is then
:&lt;math&gt;C_{p,m}=C_{V,m} + R=\frac{5}{2}R&lt;/math&gt;

=== Diatomic gas ===
[[File:DiatomicSpecHeat1.png|right|thumb|300px|Constant volume specific heat capacity of a diatomic gas (idealised). As temperature increases, heat capacity goes from 3/2 '''R''' (translation contribution only), to 5/2 '''R''' (translation plus rotation), finally to a maximum of 7/2 '''R''' (translation + rotation + vibration)]]
In the somewhat more complex case of an ideal gas of [[diatomic molecules]], the presence of internal degrees of freedom are apparent. In addition to the three translational degrees of freedom, there are rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. In general, the number of degrees of freedom, ''f'', in a molecule with ''n&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' atoms is 3''n&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;f=3n_a \,&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematically, there are a total of three rotational degrees of freedom, one corresponding to rotation about each of the axes of three-dimensional space. However, in practice only the existence of two degrees of rotational freedom for linear molecules will be considered. This approximation is valid because the moment of inertia about the internuclear axis is vanishingly small with respect to other moments of inertia in the molecule (this is due to the very small rotational moments of single atoms, due to the concentration of almost all their mass at their centers; compare also the extremely small radii of the atomic nuclei compared to the distance between them in a diatomic molecule). Quantum mechanically, it can be shown that the interval between successive rotational energy [[eigenstates]] is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia about that axis. Because the moment of inertia about the internuclear axis is vanishingly small relative to the other two rotational axes, the energy spacing can be considered so high that no excitations of the rotational state can occur unless the temperature is extremely high. It is easy to calculate the expected number of vibrational degrees of freedom (or [[vibrational modes]]). There are three degrees of translational freedom, and two degrees of rotational freedom, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;f_\mathrm{vib}=f-f_\mathrm{trans}-f_\mathrm{rot}=6-3-2=1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Each rotational and translational degree of freedom will contribute ''R''/2 in the total molar heat capacity of the gas. Each vibrational mode will contribute &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to the total molar heat capacity, however. This is because for each vibrational mode, there is a potential and kinetic energy component. Both the potential and kinetic components will contribute ''R''/2 to the total molar heat capacity of the gas. Therefore, a diatomic molecule would be expected to have a molar constant-volume heat capacity of

:&lt;math&gt;C_{V,m}=\frac{3R}{2}+R+R=\frac{7R}{2}=3.5 R&lt;/math&gt;

where the terms originate from the translational, rotational, and vibrational degrees of freedom, respectively.

[[File:DiatomicSpecHeat2.png|right|thumb|300px|Constant volume specific heat capacity of diatomic gases (real gases) between about 200&amp;nbsp;K and 2000&amp;nbsp;K. This temperature range is not large enough to include both quantum transitions in all gases. Instead, at 200&amp;nbsp;K, all but hydrogen are fully rotationally excited, so all have at least 5/2 '''R''' heat capacity. (Hydrogen is already below 5/2, but it will require cryogenic conditions for even H2 to fall to 3/2 '''R'''). Further, only the heavier gases fully reach 7/2 '''R''' at the highest temperature, due to the relatively small vibrational energy spacing of these molecules. HCl and H2 begin to make the transition above 500&amp;nbsp;K, but have not achieved it by 1000&amp;nbsp;K, since their vibrational energy level spacing is too wide to fully participate in heat capacity, even at this temperature.]]
The following is a table of some molar constant-volume heat capacities of various diatomic gases at standard temperature (25&amp;nbsp;°C = 298&amp;nbsp;K)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

From the above table, clearly there is a problem with the above theory. All of the diatomics examined have heat capacities that are lower than those predicted by the [[equipartition theorem]], except Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, as the atoms composing the molecules become heavier, the heat capacities move closer to their expected values. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is the quantization of vibrational, and to a lesser extent, rotational states. In fact, if it is assumed that the molecules remain in their lowest energy vibrational state because the inter-level energy spacings for vibration-energies are large, the predicted molar constant volume heat capacity for a diatomic molecule becomes just that from the contributions of translation and rotation:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{V,m}=\frac{3R}{2}+R=\frac{5R}{2}=2.5R&lt;/math&gt;

which is a fairly close approximation of the heat capacities of the lighter molecules in the above table. If the quantum [[harmonic oscillator]] approximation is made, it turns out that the quantum vibrational energy level spacings are actually inversely proportional to the square root of the [[reduced mass]] of the atoms composing the diatomic molecule. Therefore, in the case of the heavier diatomic molecules such as chlorine or bromine, the quantum vibrational energy level spacings become finer, which allows more excitations into higher vibrational levels at lower temperatures. This limit for storing heat capacity in vibrational modes, as discussed above, becomes 7R/2 = 3.5 R per mole of gas molecules, which is fairly consistent with the measured value for Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature. As temperatures rise, all diatomic gases approach this value.

=== General gas phase ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
&lt;!--from whose published works are we plagiarizing? And since when is&quot; Just trust me&quot; a wikipedia policy?--&gt;
The specific heat of the gas is best conceptualized in terms of the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of an individual molecule. The different degrees of freedom correspond to the different ways in which the molecule may store energy. The molecule may store energy in its translational motion according to the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2}\,m\left(v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&amp;nbsp; is the mass of the molecule and &lt;math&gt;[v_x,v_y,v_z]&lt;/math&gt; is velocity of the center of mass of the molecule. Each direction of motion constitutes a degree of freedom, so that there are three translational degrees of freedom.

In addition, a molecule may have rotational motion. The kinetic energy of rotational motion is generally expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2}\,\left(I_1\omega_1^2+I_2\omega_2^2+I_3\omega_3^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I''&amp;nbsp; is the [[moment of inertia]] tensor of the molecule, and &lt;math&gt;[\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular velocity]] pseudo-vector (in a coordinate system aligned with the principal axes of the molecule). In general, then, there will be three additional degrees of freedom corresponding to the rotational motion of the molecule, (For linear molecules one of the inertia tensor terms vanishes and there are only two rotational degrees of freedom). The degrees of freedom corresponding to translations and rotations are called the rigid degrees of freedom, since they do not involve any deformation of the molecule.

The motions of the atoms in a molecule which are not part of its gross translational motion or rotation may be classified as vibrational motions. It can be shown that if there are ''n'' atoms in the molecule, there will be as many as &lt;math&gt;v = 3n-3-n_r&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; vibrational degrees of freedom, where &lt;math&gt;n_r&lt;/math&gt; is the number of rotational degrees of freedom. A vibrational degree of freedom corresponds to a specific way in which all the atoms of a molecule can vibrate. The actual number of possible vibrations may be less than this maximal one, due to various symmetries.

For example, triatomic nitrous oxide N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O will have only 2 degrees of rotational freedom (since it is a linear molecule) and contains n=3 atoms: thus the number of possible vibrational degrees of freedom will be {{nowrap|1=''v'' = (3⋅3) − 3 − 2 = 4}}. There are four ways or &quot;modes&quot; in which the three atoms can vibrate, corresponding to ''1)'' A mode in which an atom at each end of the molecule moves away from, or towards, the center atom at the same time, ''2)'' a mode in which either end atom moves asynchronously with regard to the other two, and ''3)'' and ''4)'' two modes in which the molecule bends out of line, from the center, in the two possible planar directions that are [[orthogonal]] to its axis. Each vibrational degree of freedom confers TWO total degrees of freedom, since vibrational energy mode partitions into 1 kinetic and 1 potential mode. This would give nitrous oxide 3 translational, 2 rotational, and 4 vibrational modes (but these last giving 8 vibrational degrees of freedom), for storing energy. This is a total of {{nowrap|1=''f'' = 3 + 2 + 8 = 13}} total energy-storing degrees of freedom, for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

For a bent molecule like water H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, a similar calculation gives {{nowrap|1=9 − 3 − 3 = 3}} modes of vibration, and 3 (translational) + 3 (rotational) + 6 (vibrational) = 12 degrees of freedom.

=== The storage of energy into degrees of freedom ===
If the molecule could be entirely described using classical mechanics, then the theorem of [[equipartition of energy]] could be used to predict that each degree of freedom would have an average energy in the amount of (1/2)''kT''&amp;nbsp; where ''k''&amp;nbsp; is [[Boltzmann's constant|Boltzmann’s constant]] and ''T''&amp;nbsp; is the temperature. Our calculation of the constant-volume heat capacity would be straightforward. Each molecule would be holding, on average, an energy of (''f''/2)''kT''&amp;nbsp; where ''f''&amp;nbsp; is the total number of degrees of freedom in the molecule. Note that ''Nk = R'' if ''N'' is [[Avogadro's number]], which is the case in considering the heat capacity of a mole of molecules. Thus, the total internal energy of the gas would be (''f''/2)''NkT''&amp;nbsp; where ''N''&amp;nbsp; is the total number of molecules. The heat capacity (at constant volume) would then be a constant (''f/''2)''Nk''&amp;nbsp; the mole-specific heat capacity would be (''f/''2)''R''&amp;nbsp; the molecule-specific heat capacity would be (''f''/2)''k''&amp;nbsp; and the dimensionless heat capacity would be just ''f''/2. Here again, each vibrational degree of freedom contributes 2f. Thus, a mole of nitrous oxide would have a total constant-volume heat capacity (including vibration) of (13/2)''R'' by this calculation.

In summary, the molar heat capacity (mole-specific heat capacity) of an ideal gas with f degrees of freedom is given by

:&lt;math&gt;C_{V,m}=\frac{f}{2} R&lt;/math&gt;

This equation applies to all polyatomic gases, if the degrees of freedom are known.&lt;ref name=&quot;txtbk1&quot; /&gt;

The constant-pressure heat capacity for any gas would exceed this by an extra factor of R (see [[Julius Robert von Mayer|Mayer]]'s relation, above). As example C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; would be a total of (15/2)R/mole for nitrous oxide.

=== The effect of quantum energy levels in storing energy in degrees of freedom ===
The various degrees of freedom cannot generally be considered to obey classical mechanics, however. Classically, the energy residing in each degree of freedom is assumed to be continuous—it can take on any positive value, depending on the temperature. In reality, the amount of energy that may reside in a particular degree of freedom is quantized: It may only be increased and decreased in finite amounts. A good estimate of the size of this minimum amount is the energy of the first excited state of that degree of freedom above its ground state. For example, the first vibrational state of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) molecule has an energy of about 5.74&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−20&lt;/sup&gt; joule. If this amount of energy were deposited in a classical degree of freedom, it would correspond to a temperature of about 4156&amp;nbsp;K.

If the temperature of the substance is so low that the equipartition energy of (1/2)''kT''&amp;nbsp; is much smaller than this excitation energy, then there will be little or no energy in this degree of freedom. This degree of freedom is then said to be “frozen out&quot;. As mentioned above, the temperature corresponding to the first excited vibrational state of HCl is about 4156&amp;nbsp;K. For temperatures well below this value, the vibrational degrees of freedom of the HCl molecule will be frozen out. They will contain little energy and will not contribute to the thermal energy or the heat capacity of HCl gas.

=== Energy storage mode &quot;freeze-out&quot; temperatures ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
It can be seen that for each degree of freedom there is a critical temperature at which the degree of freedom “unfreezes” and begins to accept energy in a classical way. In the case of translational degrees of freedom, this temperature is that temperature at which the [[thermal wavelength]] of the molecules is roughly equal to the size of the container. For a container of macroscopic size (e.g. 10&amp;nbsp;cm) this temperature is extremely small and has no significance, since the gas will certainly liquify or freeze before this low temperature is reached. For any real gas translational degrees of freedom may be considered to always be classical and contain an average energy of (3/2)''kT''&amp;nbsp; per molecule.

The rotational degrees of freedom are the next to “unfreeze&quot;. In a diatomic gas, for example, the critical temperature for this transition is usually a few tens of kelvins, although with a very light molecule such as hydrogen the rotational energy levels will be spaced so widely that rotational heat capacity may not completely &quot;unfreeze&quot; until considerably higher temperatures are reached. Finally, the vibrational degrees of freedom are generally the last to unfreeze. As an example, for diatomic gases, the critical temperature for the vibrational motion is usually a few thousands of kelvins, and thus for the nitrogen in our example at room temperature, no vibration modes would be excited, and the constant-volume heat capacity at room temperature is (5/2)''R''/mole, not (7/2)''R''/mole. As seen above, with some unusually heavy gases such as iodine gas I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or bromine gas Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, some vibrational heat capacity may be observed even at room temperatures.

It should be noted that it has been assumed that atoms have no rotational or internal degrees of freedom. This is in fact untrue. For example, atomic electrons can exist in excited states and even the atomic nucleus can have excited states as well. Each of these internal degrees of freedom are assumed to be frozen out due to their relatively high excitation energy. Nevertheless, for sufficiently high temperatures, these degrees of freedom cannot be ignored. In a few exceptional cases, such molecular electronic transitions are of sufficiently low energy that they contribute to heat capacity at room temperature, or even at cryogenic temperatures. One example of an electronic transition degree of freedom which contributes heat capacity at standard temperature is that of nitric oxide (NO), in which the single electron in an anti-bonding molecular orbital has energy transitions which contribute to the heat capacity of the gas even at room temperature.

An example of a nuclear magnetic transition degree of freedom which is of importance to heat capacity, is the transition which converts the [[spin isomers of hydrogen]] gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into each other. At room temperature, the proton spins of hydrogen gas are aligned 75% of the time, resulting in ''orthohydrogen'' when they are. Thus, some thermal energy has been stored in the degree of freedom available when ''parahydrogen'' (in which spins are anti-aligned) absorbs energy, and is converted to the higher energy ortho form. However, at the temperature of liquid hydrogen, not enough heat energy is available to produce orthohydrogen (that is, the transition energy between forms is large enough to &quot;freeze out&quot; at this low temperature), and thus the parahydrogen form predominates. The heat capacity of the transition is sufficient to release enough heat, as orthohydrogen converts to the lower-energy parahydrogen, to boil the hydrogen liquid to gas again, if this evolved heat is not removed with a catalyst after the gas has been cooled and condensed. This example also illustrates the fact that some modes of storage of heat may not be in constant equilibrium with each other in substances, and heat absorbed or released from such phase changes may &quot;catch up&quot; with temperature changes of substances, only after a certain time. In other words, the heat evolved and absorbed from the ortho-para isomeric transition contributes to the heat capacity of hydrogen on long time-scales, but not on ''short'' time-scales. These time scales may also depend on the presence of a catalyst.

Less exotic phase-changes may contribute to the heat-capacity of substances and systems, as well, as (for example) when water is converted back and forth from solid to liquid or gas form. Phase changes store heat energy entirely in breaking the bonds of the potential energy interactions between molecules of a substance. As in the case of hydrogen, it is also possible for phase changes to be hindered as the temperature drops, so that they do not catch up and become apparent, without a catalyst. For example, it is possible to [[supercool]] liquid water to below the freezing point, and not observe the heat evolved when the water changes to ice, so long as the water remains liquid. This heat appears instantly when the water freezes.

=== Solid phase ===
{{Main|Einstein solid|Debye model|Kinetic theory of solids}}
[[File:DebyeVSEinstein.jpg|thumb|300px|The dimensionless heat capacity divided by three, as a function of temperature as predicted by the [[Debye model]] and by Einstein’s earlier model. The horizontal axis is the temperature divided by the Debye temperature. Note that, as expected, the dimensionless heat capacity is zero at absolute zero, and rises to a value of three as the temperature becomes much larger than the Debye temperature. The red line corresponds to the classical limit of the [[Dulong–Petit law]]]]

For matter in a crystalline solid phase, the [[Dulong–Petit law]], which was discovered empirically, states that the molar heat capacity assumes the value 3 ''R''. Indeed, for solid metallic chemical elements at room temperature, molar heat capacities range from about 2.8 ''R'' to 3.4 ''R''. Large exceptions at the lower end involve solids composed of relatively low-mass, tightly bonded atoms, such as [[beryllium]] at 2.0 ''R'', and [[diamond]] at only 0.735 ''R''. The latter conditions create larger quantum vibrational energy spacing, so that many vibrational modes have energies too high to be populated (and thus are &quot;frozen out&quot;) at room temperature. At the higher end of possible heat capacities, heat capacity may exceed ''R'' by modest amounts, due to contributions from anharmonic vibrations in solids, and sometimes a modest contribution from [[conduction electron]]s in metals. These are not degrees of freedom treated in the Einstein or Debye theories.

The theoretical maximum heat capacity for multi-atomic gases at higher temperatures, as the molecules become larger, also approaches the Dulong–Petit limit of 3 ''R'', so long as this is calculated per mole of atoms, not molecules. The reason for this behavior is that, in theory, gases with very large molecules have almost the same high-temperature heat capacity as solids, lacking only the (small) heat capacity contribution that comes from potential energy that cannot be stored between separate molecules in a gas.

The Dulong–Petit limit results from the [[equipartition theorem]], and as such is only valid in the classical limit of a [[microstate continuum]], which is a high temperature limit. For light and non-metallic elements, as well as most of the common molecular solids based on carbon compounds at [[standard ambient temperature and pressure|standard ambient temperature]], quantum effects may also play an important role, as they do in multi-atomic gases. These effects usually combine to give heat capacities lower than 3 ''R'' per mole of ''atoms'' in the solid, although in molecular solids, heat capacities calculated ''per mole of molecules'' in molecular solids may be more than 3 ''R''. For example, the heat capacity of water ice at the melting point is about 4.6 ''R'' per mole of molecules, but only 1.5 ''R'' per mole of atoms. As noted, heat capacity values far lower than 3 ''R'' &quot;per atom&quot; (as is the case with diamond and beryllium) result from “freezing out” of possible vibration modes for light atoms at suitably low temperatures, just as happens in many low-mass-atom gases at room temperatures (where vibrational modes are all frozen out). Because of high crystal binding energies, the effects of vibrational mode freezing are observed in solids more often than liquids: for example the heat capacity of liquid water is twice that of ice at near the same temperature, and is again close to the 3 ''R'' per mole of atoms of the Dulong–Petit theoretical maximum.

=== Liquid phase ===
A general theory of the heat capacity of liquids has not yet been achieved, and is still an active area of research.

Amorphous materials can be considered a type of liquid. The specific heat of amorphous materials has characteristic discontinuities at the [[Glass transition|glass transition temperature]] .These discontinuities are frequently used to detect the glass transition temperature where a supercooled liquid transforms to a glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ojovan|first1=Michael I.|title=Viscosity and Glass Transition in Amorphous Oxides|journal=Advances in Condensed Matter Physics|volume=2008|page=1|year=2008|doi=10.1155/2008/817829|bibcode = 2008AdCMP2008....1O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the especially high '''molar''' values, as for paraffin, gasoline, water and ammonia, result from calculating specific heats in terms of moles of ''molecules.'' If specific heat is expressed per mole of ''atoms'' for these substances, none of the constant-volume values exceed, to any large extent, the theoretical [[Dulong–Petit law|Dulong–Petit limit]] of 25 J⋅mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 3 R per mole of atoms (see the last column of this table). Paraffin, for example, has very large molecules and thus a high heat capacity per mole, but as a substance it does not have remarkable heat capacity in terms of volume, mass, or atom-mol (which is just 1.41 R per mole of atoms, or less than half of most solids, in terms of heat capacity per atom).

In the last column, major departures of solids at standard temperatures from the [[Dulong–Petit law]] value of 3 R, are usually due to low atomic weight plus high bond strength (as in diamond) causing some vibration modes to have too much energy to be available to store thermal energy at the measured temperature. For gases, departure from 3 R per mole of atoms in this table is generally due to two factors: '''(1)''' failure of the higher quantum-energy-spaced vibration modes in gas molecules to be excited at room temperature, and '''(2)''' loss of potential energy degree of freedom for small gas molecules, simply because most of their atoms are not bonded maximally in space to other atoms, as happens in many solids.

Two contrasting viewpoints on time divide many prominent philosophers.
One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the [[universe]]—a [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimension]] independent of events, in which events occur in [[sequence]].
[[Sir Isaac Newton]] subscribed to this [[Philosophical realism|realist]] view, and hence it is sometimes referred to as [[Absolute time and space|Newtonian time]].&lt;ref name=Rynasiewicz&gt;

The opposing view is that ''time'' does not refer to any kind of &quot;container&quot; that events and objects &quot;move through&quot;, nor to any entity that &quot;flows&quot;, but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure (together with [[space]] and [[number]]) within which humans sequence and compare events.

|quote=First of all, Leibniz finds the idea that space and time might be substances or substance-like absurd (see, for example, &quot;Correspondence with Clarke,&quot; Leibniz's Fourth Paper, §8ff). In short, an empty space would be a substance with no properties; it will be a substance that even God cannot modify or destroy.... That is, space and time are internal or intrinsic features of the complete concepts of things, not extrinsic.... Leibniz's view has two major implications. First, there is no absolute location in either space or time; location is always the situation of an object or event relative to other objects and events. Second, space and time are not in themselves real (that is, not substances). Space and time are, rather, ideal. Space and time are just metaphysically illegitimate ways of perceiving certain virtual relations between substances. They are phenomena or, strictly speaking, illusions (although they are illusions that are well-founded upon the internal properties of substances).... It is sometimes convenient to think of space and time as something &quot;out there,&quot; over and above the entities and their relations to each other, but this convenience must not be confused with reality. Space is nothing but the order of co-existent objects; time nothing but the order of successive events. This is usually called a relational theory of space and time.

The ideality of space is its mind-dependence: it is only a condition of sensibility.... Kant concluded &quot;absolute space is not an object of outer sensation; it is rather a fundamental concept which first of all makes possible all such outer sensation.&quot;...Much of the argumentation pertaining to space is applicable, mutatis mutandis, to time, so I will not rehearse the arguments.

|quote=Time, Kant argues, is also necessary as a form or condition of our intuitions of objects. The idea of time itself cannot be gathered from experience because succession and simultaneity of objects, the phenomena that would indicate the passage of time, would be impossible to represent if we did not already possess the capacity to represent objects in time.... Another way to put the point is to say that the fact that the mind of the knower makes the ''a priori'' contribution does not mean that space and time or the categories are mere figments of the imagination. Kant is an empirical realist about the world we experience; we can know objects as they appear to us. He gives a robust defense of science and the study of the natural world from his argument about the mind's role in making nature. All discursive, rational beings must conceive of the physical world as spatially and temporally unified, he argues.

holds that ''time'' is neither an event nor a thing, and thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled.

Time is one of the seven fundamental [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] in both the [[International System of Units]] and [[International System of Quantities]]. Time is used to define other quantities—such as [[velocity]]—so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;TrialogueP3&quot;&gt;Duff, Okun, Veneziano, ''ibid.'' p. 3. &quot;There is no well established terminology for the fundamental constants of Nature. … The absence of accurately defined terms or the uses (i.e., actually misuses) of ill-defined terms lead to confusion and proliferation of wrong statements.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[operational definition]] of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the [[second]], is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. The operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured. Investigations of a single continuum called [[spacetime]] bring questions about [[space]] into questions about time, questions that have their roots in the works of early students of [[natural philosophy]].

Furthermore, it may be that there is a subjective component to time, but whether or not time itself is &quot;felt&quot;, as a sensation, or is a judgment, is a matter of debate.&lt;ref name=DefRefs02&gt;

&lt;!-- This paragraph could use expansion on the phenomenology of time, comparable to the science of time in the preceding paragraph --&gt;

Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and [[Engineering technologist|technologists]], and was a prime motivation in [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]]. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the [[second]], is defined by measuring the [[electronic transition]] [[frequency]] of [[caesium]] atoms (see [[#History of time measurement devices|below]]). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (&quot;[[Time value of money|time is money]]&quot;) as well as personal value, due to an [[awareness]] of the limited time in each day and in [[life expectancy|human life spans]].

== Temporal measurement and history ==

Temporal measurement, [[chronometry]], takes two distinct period forms: the [[calendar]], a mathematical tool for organizing intervals of time,&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Mapping Time: The Calendar and its History |last=Richards |first=E. G. |date=1998 |pages=3–5 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[clock]], a physical mechanism that counts the passage of time. In day-to-day life, the clock is consulted for periods less than a day, the calendar, for periods longer than a day. Increasingly, personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously. The number (as on a clock dial or calendar) that marks the occurrence of a specified event as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch—a central reference point.

=== History of the calendar ===
{{Main|Calendar}}

Artifacts from the [[Paleolithic]] suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudgley&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age |last=Rudgley |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Rudgley |date=1999 |pages=86–105 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lunar calendar]]s were among the first to appear, either 12 or 13 [[lunar month]]s (either 354 or 384 days). Without [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] to add days or months to some years, seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months. [[Lunisolar calendar]]s have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year (now known to be about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar months. The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least partly due to this relationship of months to years.

The reforms of [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BC put the [[Roman Empire|Roman world]] on a [[solar calendar]]. This [[Julian calendar]] was faulty in that its intercalation still allowed the astronomical [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es to advance against it by about 11 minutes per year. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] introduced a correction in 1582; the [[Gregorian calendar]] was only slowly adopted by different nations over a period of centuries, but it is now the most commonly used calendar around the world, by far.

===History of time measurement devices===
[[File:Sundial Taganrog.jpg|thumb|right|Horizontal [[sundial]] in [[Taganrog]]]]
{{Main|History of timekeeping devices}}
{{See also|Clock}}

A large variety of [[Measuring instrument|devices]] has been invented to measure time. The study of these devices is called [[horology]].

An [[Egypt]]ian device that dates to c.1500 BC, similar in shape to a bent [[T-square]], measured the passage of time from the shadow cast by its crossbar on a nonlinear rule. The T was orientated eastward in the mornings. At [[noon]], the device was turned around so that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Jo Ellen ''Time's Pendulum: The Quest to Capture Time—from Sundials to Atomic Clocks'' Plenum, 1998 ISBN 0-306-45787-3 p.28
&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[sundial]] uses a [[gnomon]] to cast a shadow on a set of markings calibrated to the [[hour]]. The position of the shadow marks the hour in [[local time]].

The most precise timekeeping device of the ancient world was the [[water clock]], or ''clepsydra'', one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]] (1525–1504 BC). They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and the people from [[Chaldea]] (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, ''ibid'', p.37
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 11th century, [[List of Chinese inventions|Chinese inventors]] and [[History of science and technology in China|engineers]] invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an [[escapement]] mechanism.

[[File:Swatch Irony angle below.jpg|thumb|left|A contemporary [[quartz watch]]]]
The [[hourglass]] uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time. They were used in navigation. [[Ferdinand Magellan]] used 18 glasses on each ship for his circumnavigation of the globe (1522).&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Bergreen, ''Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe'', HarperCollins Publishers, 2003, hardcover 480 pages, ISBN 0-06-621173-5
&lt;/ref&gt;
Incense sticks and candles were, and are, commonly used to measure time in temples and churches across the globe. Waterclocks, and later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages. [[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292–1336), abbot of St. Alban's abbey, famously built a mechanical clock as an astronomical [[orrery]] about 1330.&lt;ref&gt;North, J. (2004) ''God's Clockmaker: Richard of Wallingford and the Invention of Time''. Oxbow Books. ISBN 1-85285-451-0

&lt;/ref&gt;
Great advances in accurate time-keeping were made by [[Galileo Galilei]] and especially [[Christiaan Huygens]] with the invention of pendulum driven clocks.

The English word [[clock]] probably comes from the Middle Dutch word ''klocke'' which, in turn, derives from the medieval Latin word ''clocca'', which ultimately derives from Celtic and is cognate with French, Latin, and German words that mean [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]. The passage of the hours at sea were marked by bells, and denoted the time (see [[ship's bell]]). The hours were marked by bells in abbeys as well as at sea.

Clocks can range from [[watch]]es, to more exotic varieties such as the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of means such as a [[pendulum]].

A [[chronometer watch|chronometer]] is a portable timekeeper that meets certain precision standards. Initially, the term was used to refer to the [[marine chronometer]], a timepiece used to determine [[longitude]] by means of [[celestial navigation]], a precision firstly achieved by [[John Harrison]]. More recently, the term has also been applied to the [[chronometer watch]], a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency [[COSC]].

Atomic clocks use the frequency of [[electronic transition]]s in certain atoms to measure the second. One of the most common atoms used is [[caesium]], most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n99-22.cf |title=NIST-F1 Cesium Fountain Clock |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of [[caesium]] atoms. [[International System of Units|SI]] defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs atom.

Today, the [[Global Positioning System]] in coordination with the [[Network Time Protocol]] can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems across the globe.

In medieval philosophical writings, the '''atom''' was a unit of time referred to as the smallest possible division of time. The earliest known occurrence in English is in [[Byrhtferth]]'s ''Enchiridion'' (a science text) of 1010–1012,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Byrhtferth of Ramsey&quot;. (2008). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 2008-09-15, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9438957
&lt;/ref&gt;
where it was defined as 1/564 of a ''momentum'' (1½ minutes),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;atom&quot;, [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision September 2008 (contains relevant citations from Byrhtferth's ''Enchiridion'')
&lt;/ref&gt;
and thus equal to 15/94 of a second. It was used in the ''[[computus]]'', the process of calculating the date of [[Easter]].

{{As of| May 2010}}, the smallest time interval uncertainty in direct measurements is on the order of 12 [[attosecond]]s (1.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−17&lt;/sup&gt; seconds), about 3.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; [[Planck time]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.physorg.com/news192909576.html | title=12 attoseconds is the world record for shortest controllable time | date=12 May 2010 | accessdate=19 April 2012}}

== Definitions and standards ==

The [[SI base unit]] for time is the [[SI]] [[second]]. The [[International System of Quantities]], which incorporates the SI, also defines larger units of time equal to fixed integer multiples of one second (1 s), such as the [[minute]], [[hour]] and [[day]].  These are not part of the SI, but may be used alongside the SI.  Other units of time such as the [[month]] and the [[year]] are not equal to fixed multiples of 1 s, and instead exhibit significant variations in duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;si_units&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The International System of Units (SI), 7th Edition |url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf |format=PDF |date=1998 |author=Organisation Intergouvernementale de la Convention du Métre |accessdate=9 April 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The official SI definition of the second is as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;si_units&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;second&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Base unit definitions: Second |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html |publisher=[[NIST]] |accessdate=9 April 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the [[caesium]] 133 atom.}}
{{clear left}}

At its 1997 meeting, the CIPM affirmed that this definition refers to a caesium atom in its ground state at a temperature of 0 K.&lt;ref name=&quot;si_units&quot;/&gt;
Previous to 1967, the second was defined as:
{{quote|the fraction 1/31,556,925.9747 of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours [[ephemeris time]].}}
{{clear left}}

The current definition of the second, coupled with the current definition of the metre, is based on the [[special theory of relativity]], which affirms our [[spacetime]] to be a [[Minkowski space]].

=== World time ===

Time-keeping is so critical to the functioning of modern societies that it is coordinated at an international level. The basis for scientific time is a continuous count of seconds based on [[atomic clock]]s around the world, known as the [[International Atomic Time|International Atomic Time (TAI)]]. Other scientific time standards include [[Terrestrial Time]] and [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]].

[[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is the basis for modern [[civil time]]. Since 1 January 1972, it has been defined to follow TAI with an exact offset of an integer number of seconds, changing only when a [[leap second]] is added to keep clock time synchronized with the rotation of the Earth. In TAI and UTC systems, the duration of a [[second]] is constant, as it is defined by the unchanging transition period of the caesium atom.

[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) is an older standard, adopted starting with British railways in 1847. Using telescopes instead of atomic clocks, GMT was calibrated to the [[mean solar time]] at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] in the UK. [[Universal Time]] (UT) is the modern term for the international telescope-based system, adopted to replace &quot;Greenwich Mean Time&quot; in 1928 by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system. Because the rotational period of Earth is not perfectly constant, the duration of a second would vary if calibrated to a telescope-based standard like GMT or UT—in which a second was defined as a fraction of a day or year. The terms &quot;GMT&quot; and &quot;Greenwich Mean Time&quot; are sometimes used informally to refer to UT or UTC.

The [[Global Positioning System]] also broadcasts a very precise time signal worldwide, along with instructions for converting GPS time to UTC.

Earth is split up into a number of [[time zone]]s. Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from UTC or GMT. In many locations these offsets vary twice yearly due to [[daylight saving time]] transitions.

=== Time conversions ===

These conversions are accurate at the millisecond level for time systems involving earth rotation (UT1 &amp; TT). Conversions between atomic time systems (TAI, GPS, and UTC) are accurate at the microsecond level.

=== Sidereal time ===

[[Sidereal time]] is the measurement of time relative to a distant star (instead of solar time that is relative to the sun). It is used in astronomy to predict when a star will be overhead. Due to the orbit of the earth around the sun a sidereal day is about 4 minutes (1/366th) less than a solar day.

=== Chronology ===
{{Main|Chronology}}

Another form of time measurement consists of studying the [[past]]. Events in the past can be ordered in a sequence (creating a [[chronology]]), and can be put into chronological groups ([[periodization]]). One of the most important systems of periodization is the [[geologic time scale]], which is a system of periodizing the events that shaped the [[Earth]] and its life. Chronology, periodization, and interpretation of the past are together known as the study of [[history]].

=== Time-like concepts: terminology ===

The term &quot;time&quot; is generally used for many close but different concepts, including:
*instant&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60050-113:2011, item 113-01-08&lt;/ref&gt; as an object—one point on the time axes. Being an object, it has no value;
*time interval&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60050-113:2011, item 113-01-010; ISO 80000-3:2006, item 3-7&lt;/ref&gt; as an object—part of the time axes limited by two instants. Being an object, it has no value;
*date&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60050-113:2011, item 113-01-012: &quot;mark attributed to an instant by means of a specified time scale&lt;/ref&gt; as a quantity characterizing an instant. As a quantity, it has a value which may be expressed in a variety of ways, for example &quot;2014-04-26T09:42:36,75&quot; in [[ISO 8601|ISO standard]] format, or more colloquially such as &quot;today, 9:42&amp;nbsp;a.m.&quot;;
*duration&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60050-113:2011, item 113-01-013: &quot;range of a time interval (113-01-10)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as a quantity characterizing a time interval.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-3:2006, item 3-7&lt;/ref&gt; As a quantity, it has a value, such as a number of minutes, or may be described in terms of the quantities (such as times and dates) of its beginning and end.

| quote                 = Profane time, as [[Mircea Eliade | Eliade]] points out, is linear. As man dwelt increasingly in the profane and a sense of history developed, the desire to escape into the sacred began to drop in the background. The myths, tied up with cyclic time, were not so easily operative. [...] So secular man became content with his linear time. He could not return to cyclic time and re-enter sacred space though its myths. [...] Just here, as Eliade sees it, a new religious structure became available. In the Judaeo-Christian religions - Judaism, Christianity, Islam - history is taken seriously, and linear time is accepted. The cyclic time of the primordial mythical consciousness has been transformed into the time of profane man, but the mythical consciousness remains. It has been historicized. The Christian mythos and its accompanying ritual are bound up, for example, with history and center in authentic history, especially the Christ-event. Sacred space, the Transcendent Presence, is thus opened up to secular man because it meets him where he is, in the linear flow of secular time. The Christian myth gives such time a beginning in creation, a center in the Christ-event, and an end in the final consummation.

=== Time in Greek mythology ===

The Greek language denotes two distinct principles, [[Chronos]] and [[Kairos]]. The former refers to numeric, or chronological, time. The latter, literally &quot;the right or opportune moment&quot;, relates specifically to metaphysical or Divine time. In theology, Kairos is qualitative, as opposed to quantitative.

In Greek mythology, Chronos (Ancient Greek: Χρόνος) is identified as the Personification of Time. His name in Greek means &quot;time&quot; and is alternatively spelled Chronus (Latin spelling) or Khronos. Chronos is usually portrayed as an old, wise man with a long, gray beard, such as &quot;Father Time&quot;. Some English words whose etymological root is khronos/chronos include ''chronology'', ''chronometer'', ''chronic'', ''anachronism'', ''synchronize'', and ''chronicle''.

== Philosophy ==
{{Main|Philosophy of space and time|Temporal finitism}}

Two distinct viewpoints on time divide many prominent philosophers.
One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the [[universe]], a [[dimension]] in which events occur in [[sequence]]. [[Sir Isaac Newton]] subscribed to this [[Philosophical realism|realist]] view, and hence it is sometimes referred to as [[Absolute time and space|Newtonian time]].&lt;ref name=Markosian /&gt;
An opposing view is that ''time'' does not refer to any kind of actually existing dimension that events and objects &quot;move through&quot;, nor to any entity that &quot;flows&quot;, but that it is instead an intellectual concept (together with [[space]] and [[number]]) that enables humans to sequence and compare events.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
This second view, in the tradition of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot;/&gt;
and [[Immanuel Kant]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mattey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McCormick&quot;/&gt;
holds that space and time &quot;do not exist in and of themselves, but ... are the product of the way we represent things&quot;, because we can know objects only as they [[Perception|appear]] to us.

The ''[[Vedas]]'', the earliest texts on [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Hindu philosophy]] dating back to the late [[2nd millennium BC]], describe ancient [[Hindu cosmology]], in which the [[universe]] goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320 million years.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Ancient philosophy|Ancient]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], including [[Parmenides]] and [[Heraclitus]], wrote essays on the nature of time.&lt;ref&gt;Dagobert Runes, ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', p. 318
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Plato]], in the [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus'']], identified time with the period of motion of the heavenly bodies. [[Aristotle]], in Book IV of his [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physica'']] defined time as 'number of movement in respect of the before and after'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu//Aristotle/physics.4.iv.html |title=Physics by Aristotle |last1=Hardie |first1=R.

(Number, we must note, is used in two senses-both of what is counted or the countable and also of that with which we count. Time obviously is what is counted, not that with which we count: there are different kinds of thing.) [...] It is clear, then, that time is 'number of movement in respect of the before and after', and is continuous since it is an attribute of what is continuous. ''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book 11 of his ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] ruminates on the nature of time, asking, &quot;What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not.&quot; He begins to define time by what it is not rather than what it is,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
an approach similar to that taken in other [[negative theology|negative definitions]]. However, Augustine ends up calling time a “distention” of the mind (Confessions 11.26) by which we simultaneously grasp the past in memory, the present by attention, and the future by expectation.

In contrast to ancient Greek philosophers who believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and [[Theology|theologians]] developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning.
This view is shared by Abrahamic faiths as they believe time started by creation, therefore the only thing being infinite is God and everything else, including time, is finite.

[[Isaac Newton]] believed in absolute space and absolute time; Leibniz believed that time and space are relational.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Martin, ''Kant's Metaphysics and Theory of Science''
&lt;/ref&gt;
The differences between Leibniz's and Newton's interpretations came to a head in the famous [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]].

&lt;/ref&gt;
With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as [[Substance theory|substances]], but rather both are elements of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an [[Abstract structure|abstract]] conceptual framework, together with [[space]] and [[number]], within which we sequence events, [[quantity|quantify]] their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, ''time'' does not refer to any kind of entity that &quot;flows,&quot; that objects &quot;move through,&quot; or that is a &quot;container&quot; for events. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] the extent of and distances between [[object (philosophy)|objects]], and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between [[Phenomenon|events]]. Time was designated by Kant as the purest possible [[Schema (Kant)#Time|schema]] of a pure concept or category.

[[Henri Bergson]] believed that time was neither a real homogeneous medium nor a mental construct, but possesses what he referred to as ''[[Duration (philosophy)|Duration]]''. Duration, in Bergson's view, was creativity and memory as an essential component of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Bergson, Henri (1907) ''Creative Evolution''. trans. by Arthur Mitchell. Mineola: Dover, 1998.
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Heidegger]] we do not exist inside time, ''we are time''. Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of ''having been'', which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes &quot;being ahead of oneself&quot; when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended.&lt;ref name=Balslev&gt;

=== Time as &quot;unreal&quot; ===

In 5th century BC [[Greece]], [[Antiphon (orator)|Antiphon]] the [[Sophist]], in a fragment preserved from his chief work ''On Truth'', held that: ''&quot;Time is not a reality (hypostasis), but a concept (noêma) or a measure (metron).&quot;''
[[Parmenides]] went further, maintaining that time, motion, and change were illusions, leading to the [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of his follower [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Harry Foundalis |title=You are about to disappear |url=http://www.foundalis.com/phi/WhyTimeFlows.htm |accessdate=9 April 2011}}

[[J. M. E. McTaggart]]'s 1908 ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'' argues that, since every event has the characteristic of being both present and not present (i.e., future or past), that time is a self-contradictory idea (see also [[Philosophy of space and time#The flow of time|The flow of time]]).

These arguments often center around what it means for something to be ''unreal''. Modern physicists generally believe that time is as ''real'' as space—though others, such as [[Julian Barbour]] in his book ''[[The End of Time (book)|The End of Time]]'', argue that quantum equations of the universe take their true form when expressed in the timeless [[configuration space|realm]] containing every possible ''now'' or momentary configuration of the universe, called '[[Platonia (philosophy)|platonia]]' by Barbour.&lt;ref&gt;

== Physical definition ==
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}
{{Main|Time in physics}}

Until [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] profound reinterpretation of the physical concepts associated with time and space, time was considered to be the same everywhere in the universe, with all observers measuring the same time interval for any event.&lt;ref&gt;Herman M. Schwartz, ''Introduction to Special Relativity'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1968, hardcover 442 pages, see ISBN 0-88275-478-5 (1977 edition), pp. 10–13
&lt;/ref&gt;
Non-relativistic [[classical mechanics]] is based on this Newtonian idea of time.

Einstein, in his [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Einstein, H. A. Lorentz, H. Weyl, H. Minkowski, ''The Principle of Relativity'', Dover Publications, Inc, 2000, softcover 216 pages, ISBN 0-486-60081-5, See pp. 37–65 for an English translation of Einstein's original 1905 paper.
&lt;/ref&gt;
postulated the constancy and finiteness of the speed of light for all observers. He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer.

The theory of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in [[Minkowski space]]time, a mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of space with a single dimension of time. In this formalism, distances in space can be measured by how long light takes to travel that distance, e.g., a [[light-year]] is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Two [[Event (relativity)|events]] in Minkowski spacetime are separated by an ''[[Spacetime interval|invariant interval]]'', which can be either [[space-like]], [[light-like]], or [[time-like]]. Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in any [[frame of reference]], there must be a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation. Events that have a space-like separation will be simultaneous in some frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference in which they do not have a spatial separation. Different observers may calculate different distances and different time intervals between two events, but the ''invariant interval'' between the events is independent of the observer (and his velocity).

=== Classical mechanics ===

In non-relativistic [[classical mechanics]], Newton's concept of &quot;relative, apparent, and common time&quot; can be used in the formulation of a prescription for the synchronization of clocks. Events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works sufficiently well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people's experience. In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism. Einstein resolved these problems by invoking a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity. This led directly to the result that observers in motion relative to one another measure different elapsed times for the same event.

[[File:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|Two-dimensional space depicted in three-dimensional [[spacetime]]. The past and future [[light cone]]s are absolute, the &quot;present&quot; is a relative concept different for observers in relative motion.]]

=== Spacetime ===
{{Main|Spacetime}}
Time has historically been closely related with [[space]], the two together merging into [[spacetime]] in [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the [[inertial frame of reference|spatial reference frame of the observer]], and the human perception as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks are different for observers in relative motion. For example, if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through space at (very nearly) the speed of light, its crew does not notice a change in the speed of time on board their vessel because everything traveling at the same speed slows down at the same rate (including the clock, the crew's thought processes, and the functions of their bodies). However, to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly.

On the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel, because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other. Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the stationary observer) are many light years apart. This is reconciled by the fact that the crew's perception of time is different from the stationary observer's; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer. In either case, however, causality remains unchanged: the [[past]] is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the [[future]] is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9zrt__lec |title=Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity |publisher=YouTube |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vpw4AH8QQ |title=Time Travel: Einstein's big idea (Theory of Relativity) |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hours |first=After |url=http://www.cracked.com/article_19659_7-theories-time-that-would-make-doc-browns-head-explode.html |title=7 Theories on Time That Would Make Doc Brown's Head Explode |publisher=Cracked.com |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time dilation ===
[[File:Relativity of Simultaneity.svg|thumb|[[Relativity of simultaneity]]: Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurred before in the blue frame, and occurs later in the red frame.]]
{{Main|Time dilation}}

[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on [[Causality (physics)|cause and effect]], measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Many [[subatomic particle]]s exist for only a fixed fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but some that travel close to the speed of light can be measured to travel farther and survive much longer than expected (a [[muon]] is one example). According to the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], in the high-speed particle's [[Inertial frame of reference|frame of reference]], it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its [[mean lifetime]], and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to &quot;slow down&quot; for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or &quot;warped&quot;) by high-speed motion.

Einstein (''The Meaning of Relativity''): &quot;Two [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|events]] taking place at the points A and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relatively to K, which register the same simultaneously.&quot;

Einstein wrote in his book, ''Relativity'', that [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity is also relative]], i.e., two events that appear simultaneous to an observer in a particular inertial reference frame need not be judged as simultaneous by a second observer in a different inertial frame of reference.

=== Relativistic time versus Newtonian time ===
[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed|Views of spacetime along the [[world line]] of a rapidly accelerating observer in a relativistic universe. The events (&quot;dots&quot;) that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past [[light cone]] of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer.]]

The animations visualise the different treatments of time in the Newtonian and the relativistic descriptions. At the heart of these differences are the [[Galilean transformation|Galilean]] and [[Lorentz transformation]]s applicable in the Newtonian and relativistic theories, respectively.

In the figures, the vertical direction indicates time. The horizontal direction indicates distance (only one spatial dimension is taken into account), and the thick dashed curve is the [[spacetime]] trajectory (&quot;[[world line]]&quot;) of the observer. The small dots indicate specific (past and future) events in spacetime.

The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how in both pictures the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates.

In the Newtonian description these changes are such that ''time'' is absolute:&lt;ref&gt;Mughal, Muhammad Aurang Zeb. 2009. [http://dro.dur.ac.uk/10920/1/10920.pdf Time, Absolute]. H. James Birx (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology, and Culture'', Vol. 3. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, pp. 1254-1255.&lt;/ref&gt; the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event occurs in the 'now' (i.e., whether an event passes the horizontal line through the observer).

However, in the relativistic description the ''observability of events'' is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event passes the &quot;[[light cone]]&quot; of the observer. Notice that with the change from a Newtonian to a relativistic description, the concept of ''absolute time'' is no longer applicable: events move up-and-down in the figure depending on the acceleration of the observer.

=== Arrow of time ===
{{Main|Arrow of time}}

Time appears to have a direction—the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an [[arrow of time]], and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modeled by a parameter in the system being analyzed, where there is no &quot;proper time&quot;: the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the [[Second law of thermodynamics]], which states that [[entropy]] must increase over time (see [[Entropy (arrow of time)|Entropy]]); the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] arrow of time, which points away from the [[Big Bang]], [[CPT symmetry]], and the radiative arrow of time, caused by [[light]] only traveling forwards in time (see [[light cone]]). In [[particle physics]], the [[CP violation|violation of CP symmetry]] implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve [[CPT symmetry]] as stated above. The standard description of [[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]] is also time asymmetric (see [[Measurement in quantum mechanics]]).

=== Quantized time ===
{{See also|Chronon}}

Time quantization is a hypothetical concept. In the modern established physical theories (the [[Standard Model]] of Particles and Interactions and [[General Relativity]]) time is not quantized.

[[Planck time]] (~ 5.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−44&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) is the unit of time in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]]. Current established physical theories are believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in principle. Tentative physical theories that describe this time scale exist; see for instance [[loop quantum gravity]].

== Time and the Big Bang theory ==

[[Stephen Hawking]] in particular has addressed a connection between time and the [[Big Bang]]. In ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' and elsewhere, Hawking says that even if time did not begin with the Big Bang and there were another time frame before the Big Bang, no information from events then would be accessible to us, and nothing that happened then would have any effect upon the present time-frame.&lt;ref name=BOT-lecture-62-1&gt;

|quote=Where Einstein had said that what is not measurable by physicists is of no interest to them, Hawking flatly asserts that what is not measurable by physicists does not exist—has no reality whatsoever.&lt;br&gt;With respect to time, that amounts to the denial of psychological time which is not measurable by physicists, and also to everlasting time—time before the Big Bang—which physics cannot measure. Hawking does not know that both Aquinas and Kant had shown that we cannot rationally establish that time is either finite or infinite.

Scientists have come to some agreement on descriptions of events that happened 10&lt;sup&gt;−35&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, but generally agree that descriptions about what happened before one [[Planck time]] (5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−44&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) after the Big Bang are likely to remain pure speculation.

=== Speculative physics beyond the Big Bang ===
&lt;!-- article is about TIME, not about the Big Bang. This section needs to go to [[Big Bang]] article --&gt;
[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A graphical representation of the [[metric expansion of the universe|expansion of the universe]] with the inflationary epoch represented as the dramatic expansion of the [[metric tensor|metric]] seen on the left]]

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined in the future. Little is known about the earliest moments of the universe's history. The [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]] require the existence of a singularity at the beginning of cosmic time. However, these theorems assume that [[general relativity]] is correct, but general relativity must break down before the universe reaches the [[Planck temperature]], and a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]] may avoid the singularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawking, Stephen; and Ellis, G. F. R. |title=The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1973 |isbn=0-521-09906-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

There may also be parts of the universe well beyond what can be observed in principle. If inflation occurred this is likely, for exponential expansion would push large regions of space beyond our observable horizon.

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:

&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals in the last two categories see the Big Bang as an event in a much larger and older universe, or [[multiverse]], and not the literal beginning.

== Time travel ==
{{Main|Time travel}}
{{See also|Time travel in fiction|Wormhole|Twin paradox}}

Time travel is the concept of moving backwards or forwards to different points in time, in a manner analogous to moving through [[space]], and different from the normal &quot;flow&quot; of time to an earthbound observer. In this view, all points in time (including future times) &quot;persist&quot; in some way. Time travel has been a [[plot device]] in [[fiction]] since the 19th century. Traveling backwards in time has never been verified, presents many theoretic problems, and may be an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/10 G. Quznetsov, Prespacetime Journal, March 2010, Vol.1, Issue 2, Page 274-275]&lt;/ref&gt;
Any technological device, whether fictional or hypothetical, that is used to achieve time travel is known as a [[Time travel|time machine]].

A central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of [[causality]]; should an effect precede its cause, it would give rise to the possibility of a [[temporal paradox]]. Some interpretations of time travel resolve this by accepting the possibility of travel between [[Many-worlds interpretation|branch points]], [[Multiverse|parallel realities]], or [[universe]]s.

Another solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, [[free will]] either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. As such, it would not be possible to enact the [[grandfather paradox]] because it is a historical fact that your grandfather was not killed before his child (your parent) was conceived. This view doesn't simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but that any change made by a hypothetical future time traveler would already have happened in his or her past, resulting in the reality that the traveler moves from. More elaboration on this view can be found in the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]].

== Time perception ==
{{Main|Time perception}}

The [[specious present]] refers to the time duration wherein one's [[perception]]s are considered to be in the present. The experienced present is said to be ‘specious’ in that, unlike the objective present, it is an interval and not a durationless instant. The term ''specious present'' was first introduced by the psychologist [[E.R. Clay]], and later developed by [[William James]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andersen, Holly |author2=Rick Grush |title=A brief history of time-consciousness: historical precursors to James and Husserl |publisher=Journal of the History of Philosophy |date=2009&lt;!--publication info: http://mind.ucsd.edu/papers/!papers.html--&gt; |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=277–307 |url=http://mind.ucsd.edu/papers/bhtc/Andersen&amp;Grush.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=9 April 2011 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biopsychology ===

The brain's judgment of time is known to be a highly distributed system, including at least the [[cerebral cortex]], [[cerebellum]] and [[basal ganglia]] as its components. One particular component, the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus|suprachiasmatic nuclei]], is responsible for the [[circadian rhythm|circadian (or daily) rhythm]], while other cell clusters appear capable of shorter-range ([[ultradian]]) timekeeping.

Psychoactive drugs can impair the judgment of time. [[Stimulant]]s can lead both humans and rats to overestimate time intervals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quotes=|last=Wittmann |first=M. |author2=Leland DS |author3=Churan J |author4=Paulus MP.  |date=8 October 2007|title=Impaired time perception and motor timing in stimulant-dependent subjects |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend. |volume=90 |issue=2–3 |pages=183–92 |pmid=17434690 |pmc=1997301 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2007.03.005 |format=online abstract}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
The level of activity in the brain of [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] may be the reason for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arzy |first=Shahar |author2=Istvan Molnar-Szakacs |author3=Olaf Blanke  |date=18 June 2008 |title=Self in Time: Imagined Self-Location Influences Neural Activity Related to Mental Time Travel |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=25 |pages=6502–6507 |pmid=18562621|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5712-07.2008 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/25/6502.abstract |format=Abstract |accessdate=9 April 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Such chemicals will either excite or inhibit the firing of [[neuron]]s in the brain, with a greater firing rate allowing the brain to register the occurrence of more events within a given interval (speed up time) and a decreased firing rate reducing the brain's capacity to distinguish events occurring within a given interval (slow down time).&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 186–187&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Human Brain Book |first1=Rita |last1=Carter |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-7566-5441-2 |pages=186–187 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eCV6cwU3qm0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mental chronometry]] is the use of response time in perceptual-motor tasks to infer the content, duration, and temporal sequencing of cognitive operations.

=== Development of awareness and understanding of time in children ===

Children's expanding cognitive abilities allow them to understand time more clearly. Two- and three-year-olds' understanding of time is mainly limited to &quot;now and not now.&quot; Five- and six-year-olds can grasp the ideas of past, present, and future. Seven- to ten-year-olds can use clocks and calendars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201403/time-management-kids |title=Time Management for Kids |last= Kennedy-Moore |first=Eileen |date=28 March 2014 |work= |publisher=Psychology Today |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alterations ===

In addition to psychoactive drugs, judgments of time can be altered by [[temporal illusion]]s (like the [[kappa effect]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Wada&quot;&gt;Wada Y, Masuda T, Noguchi K, 2005, &quot;Temporal illusion called 'kappa effect' in event perception&quot; Perception 34 ECVP Abstract Supplement

and [[hypnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a790232921~db=all |title=Hypnosis and the perception of time |publisher=International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis |volume=27 |issue=1 |date=January 1979|pages=29–41 |doi=10.1080/00207147908407540|author=Bowers, Kenneth |journal=International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis |pmid=541126 |last2=Brenneman |first2=HA |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The sense of time is impaired in some people with neurological diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[attention deficit disorder]].

Psychologists assert that time seems to go faster with age, but the literature on this age-related perception of time remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies on the structure of time: from physics to psycho(patho)logy |chapter=Subjective Time Versus Proper (Clock) Time |editor1-first=R. |editor1-last=Buccheri

&lt;/ref&gt;
Those who support this notion argue that young people, having more excitatory neurotransmitters, are able to cope with faster external events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter 186–187&quot;/&gt;

== Use of time ==
{{See also|Time management|Time discipline}}

In [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], [[time discipline]] is the general name given to [[society|social]] and [[economics|economic]] rules, conventions, customs, and expectations governing the measurement of time, the [[social currency]] and awareness of time measurements, and people's expectations concerning the observance of these customs by others. [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild | title = [[Time bind|The time bind: when work becomes home and home becomes work]] | publisher = Metropolitan Books | location = New York | year = 1997 }} ISBN 9780805044713&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/20/magazine/there-s-no-place-like-work.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22there%27s%20no%20place%20like%20work%22&amp;st=cse|title=There's no place like work|work= [[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Magazine]] | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date= 20 April 1997  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Norbert Elias]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Elias | first = Norbert | author-link = Norbert Elias | title = Time: an essay | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford, UK Cambridge, USA | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780631157984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have written on the use of time from a sociological perspective.

The use of time is an important issue in understanding [[human behavior]], [[education]], and [[travel behavior]]. [[Time-use research]] is a developing field of study. The question concerns how time is allocated across a number of activities (such as time spent at home, at work, shopping, etc.). Time use changes with [[technology]], as the [[television]] or the [[Internet]] created new opportunities to use time in different ways. However, some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in [[transport]], has been observed to be about 20–30 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period.

[[Time management]] is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how much time a task requires and when it must be completed, and adjusting events that would interfere with its completion so it is done in the appropriate amount of time. Calendars and day planners are common examples of time management tools.

A sequence of events, or series of events, is a [[sequence]] of items, facts, events, actions, changes, or procedural steps, arranged in time order (chronological order), often with [[causality]] relationships among the items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sequence - Order of Important Events|url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/la/resources/documents/instResources/LA_res_Seq_ORS_Module.pdf|publisher=[[Austin Independent School District]]|date=2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Sequence of Events Worksheets|url=http://www.reference.com/motif/Science/sequence-of-events-worksheets|publisher=[[Reference.com]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|author=Compiled by David Luckham and Roy Schulte|title=Event Processing Glossary—Version 2.0|url=http://www.complexevents.com/2011/08/23/event-processing-glossary-version-2-0/|publisher=Complex Event Processing}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of [[causality]], cause precedes [[result|effect]], or cause and effect may appear together in a single item, but effect never precedes cause. A sequence of events can be presented in text, [[Table (information)|tables]], [[chart]]s, or [[timeline]]s. The description of the items or events may include a [[timestamp]]. A sequence of events that includes the time along with place or location information to describe a sequential path may be referred to as a [[world line]].

Uses of a sequence of events include stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Nordquist|title=narrative|url=http://grammar.about.com/od/mo/g/narrative2term.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[History|historical]] events ([[chronology]]), directions and steps in [[procedure (term)|procedures]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David J. Piasecki|title=Inventory Accuracy Glossary|url=http://www.accuracybook.com/glossary.htm|publisher=AccuracyBook.com (OPS Publishing)}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and timetables for scheduling activities. A sequence of events may also be used to help describe [[Process (engineering)|processes]] in science, technology, and medicine. A sequence of events may be focused on past events (e.g., stories, history, chronology), on future events that must be in a predetermined order (e.g., [[plan]]s, [[schedule (project management)|schedules]], procedures, timetables), or focused on the observation of past events with the expectation that the events will occur in the future (e.g., processes). The use of a sequence of events occurs in fields as diverse as [[machine]]s ([[cam timer]]), [[documentary|documentaries]] (''[[Seconds From Disaster]]''), [[law]] ([[Choice of law#Sequence of events in conflict cases|choice of law]]), [[computer simulation]] ([[discrete event simulation]]), and [[electric power transmission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utility Communications Architecture (UCA) glossary|url=http://www.nettedautomation.com/glossary_menue/glossary_uca.html|publisher=NettedAutomation}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
([[sequence of events recorder]]). A specific example of a sequence of events is the [[timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].

{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}
In everyday use and in [[kinematics]], the '''speed''' of an object is the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of its [[velocity]] (the [[time derivative|rate of change]] of its [[Position (vector)|position]]); it is thus a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edwin Bidwell|title=Vector analysis: a text-book for the use of students of mathematics and physics, founded upon the lectures of J. Willard Gibbs|date=1901|pages=125|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015000962285?urlappend=%3Bseq=149}} This is the likely origin of the speed/velocity terminology in vector physics.&lt;/ref&gt; The '''average speed''' of an object in an interval of time is the [[distance]] travelled by the object divided by the [[Time|duration]] of the interval;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speed &amp; Velocity|url=http://physics.info/velocity/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the instantaneous speed is the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero.

Like velocity, speed has the [[dimensional analysis|dimension]]s of a [[length]] divided by a [[time]]; the [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of speed is the [[metre per second]], but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the [[kilometre per hour]] or, in the US and the UK, [[miles per hour]]. For air and marine travel the [[Knot (unit)|knot]] is commonly used.

The fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to [[special relativity]], is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum ''c'' = {{val|299792458}} metres per second (approximately {{val|1079000000|u=km/h}} or {{val|671000000|u=mph}}). [[Matter]] cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept of [[rapidity]] replaces the classical idea of speed.

==Definition==
The Italian physicist [[Galileo Galilei]] is credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes. Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewitt 2006, p. 42&quot;&gt;Hewitt (2006), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In equation form, this is

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{d}{t},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is speed, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is distance, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time. A cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds, for example, has a speed of 15 metres per second. Objects in motion often have variations in speed (a car might travel along a street at 50&amp;nbsp;km/h, slow to 0&amp;nbsp;km/h, and then reach 30&amp;nbsp;km/h).

In mathematical terms, the speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the magnitude of the [[velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the [[derivative]] of the position &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to [[time]]:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \left|\boldsymbol v\right| = \left|\dot {\boldsymbol r}\right| = \left|\frac{d\boldsymbol r}{dt}\right|\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the path travelled until time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the speed equals the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{ds}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the special case where the velocity is constant (that is, constant speed in a straight line), this can be simplified to &lt;math&gt;v=s/t&lt;/math&gt;.  The average speed over a finite time interval is the total distance travelled divided by the time duration.

===Instantaneous speed===
By looking at a [[speedometer]], one can read the speed of a car at any instant, or its ''instantaneous speed''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewitt 2006, p. 42&quot;/&gt; A car travelling at 50&amp;nbsp;km/h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed, but if it did go at that speed for a full hour, it would travel 50&amp;nbsp;km. If the vehicle continued at that speed for half an hour, it would cover half that distance (25&amp;nbsp;km). If it continued for only one minute, it would cover about 833&amp;nbsp;m.

===Average speed===
Different from instantaneous speed, ''average speed'' is defined as the total distance covered over the time interval. For example, if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour, the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour. Likewise, if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours, the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour. When a distance in kilometres (km) is divided by a time in hours (h), the result is in kilometres per hour (km/h). Average speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals (as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total time of travel), and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewitt 2006, p. 42&quot;/&gt; If the average speed and the time of travel are known, the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the definition to

:&lt;math&gt;d = \boldsymbol{\bar{v}}t\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4-hour trip, the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres. 

Expressed in graphical language, the [[slope]] of a [[tangent line]] at any point of a distance-time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point, while the slope of a [[chord (geometry)|chord line]] of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval covered by the chord.

===Tangential speed===
Linear speed is the distance travelled per unit of time, while '''tangential speed''' (or tangential velocity) is the linear speed of something moving along a circular path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewitt 2006, p. 131&quot;&gt;Hewitt (2006), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; A point on the outside edge of a [[merry-go-round]] or [[turntable]] travels a greater distance in one complete rotation than a point nearer the center. Travelling a greater distance in the same time means a greater speed, and so linear speed is greater on the outer edge of a rotating object than it is closer to the axis. This speed along a circular path is known as ''tangential speed'' because the direction of motion is [[Tangent lines to circles|tangent]] to the [[circumference]] of the circle. For circular motion, the terms linear speed and tangential speed are used interchangeably, and both use units of m/s, km/h, and others.

[[Rotational speed]] (or ''angular speed'') involves the number of revolutions per unit of time. All parts of a rigid merry-go-round or turntable turn about the axis of rotation in the same amount of time. Thus, all parts share the same rate of rotation, or the same number of rotations or revolutions per unit of time. It is common to express rotational rates in revolutions per minute (RPM) or in terms of the number of &quot;radians&quot; turned in a unit of time. There are little more than 6 radians in a full rotation (2{{pi}} radians exactly). When a direction is assigned to rotational speed, it is known as rotational velocity or angular velocity. Rotational velocity is a vector whose magnitude is the rotational speed.

Tangential speed and rotational speed are related: the greater the RPMs, the larger the speed in metres per second. Tangential speed is directly proportional to rotational speed at any fixed distance from the axis of rotation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hewitt 2006, p. 131&quot;/&gt; However, tangential speed, unlike rotational speed, depends on radial distance (the distance from the axis). For a platform rotating with a fixed rotational speed, the tangential speed in the centre is zero. Towards the edge of the platform the tangential speed increases proportional to the distance from the axis.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (2006), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; In equation form:

:&lt;math&gt;v \propto \!\, r \omega\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is tangential speed and ω (Greek letter [[omega]]) is rotational speed. One moves faster if the rate of rotation increases (a larger value for ω), and one also moves faster if movement farther from the axis occurs (a larger value for ''r''). Move twice as far from the rotational axis at the centre and you move twice as fast. Move out three times as far and you have three times as much tangential speed. In any kind of rotating system, tangential speed depends on how far you are from the axis of rotation.

When proper units are used for tangential speed ''v'', rotational speed ω, and radial distance ''r'', the direct proportion of ''v'' to both ''r'' and ω becomes the exact equation

:&lt;math&gt;v = r\omega\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, tangential speed will be directly proportional to ''r'' when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same ω, as for a wheel, disk, or rigid wand.

'''Solubility''' is the property of a [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gaseous]] [[chemical substance]] called ''[[solution|solute]]'' to [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolve]] in a solid, liquid, or gaseous [[solvent]] to form a [[solution]] of the solute in the solvent. The solubility of a substance fundamentally depends on the physical and chemical properties of the solute and solvent as well as on temperature, pressure and  the pH of the solution. The extent of the solubility of a substance in a specific solvent is measured as the [[saturation (chemistry)|saturation]] concentration, where adding more solute does not increase the concentration of the solution and begins to precipitate the excess amount of solute. The solubility of a substance is an entirely different property from the [[rate of solution]], which is how fast it dissolves.

Most often, the solvent is a liquid, which can be a pure substance or a [[mixture]]. One may also speak of [[solid solution]], but rarely of solution in a gas (see [[vapor–liquid equilibrium]] instead).

The extent of solubility ranges widely, from infinitely soluble (without limit) (fully [[miscible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clugston M. and Fleming R. |year=2000|page=108| title=Advanced Chemistry| edition=1st| publisher = Oxford Publishing| location = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;) such as [[ethanol]] in water, to poorly soluble, such as [[silver chloride]] in water. The term ''insoluble'' is often applied to poorly or very poorly soluble compounds. A common threshold to describe something as insoluble is less than 0.1 g per 100 mL of solvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chem.wisc.edu/deptfiles/genchem/sstutorial/Text11/Tx112/tx112.html |title=Fundamentals of Chemistry: Solubility |last1=Rogers |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Stovall |first2=Iris |date=2000 |website=Department of Chemistry |publisher=University of Wisconsin |access-date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under certain conditions, the [[solubility equilibrium|equilibrium solubility]] can be exceeded to give a so-called [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] solution, which is [[Metastability in molecules|metastable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?metastable |title=Cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk |work=Online Medical Dictionary |publisher=Newcastle University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090819071542/http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk:80/cgi-bin/omd?metastable |archivedate=August 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metastability of crystals can also lead to apparent differences in the amount of a chemical that dissolves depending on its crystalline form or particle size. A supersaturated solution generally crystallises when 'seed' crystals are introduced and rapid equilibration occurs. Phenylsalicylate is one such simple observable substance when fully melted and then cooled below its fusion point.

Solubility is not to be confused with the ability to 'dissolve' a substance, because the solution might also occur because of a chemical reaction. For example, zinc 'dissolves' (with [[effervescence]]) in hydrochloric acid as a result of a chemical reaction releasing hydrogen gas in a [[displacement reaction]]. The zinc ions are soluble in the acid.

The smaller a particle is, the faster it dissolves although there are many factors to add to this generalization.

Crucially solubility applies to all areas of chemistry, geochemistry, inorganic, physical, organic and biochemistry. In all cases it will depend on the physical conditions (temperature, pressure and concentration) and the enthalpy and entropy directly relating to the solvents and solutes concerned.
By far the most common solvent in chemistry is [[water]] which is a [[solvent]] for most ionic compounds as well as a wide range of organic substances. This is a crucial factor in acidity/alkalinity and much environmental and geochemical work.

== IUPAC definition ==
According to the [[IUPAC]] definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Solubility|file=S05740}}&lt;/ref&gt; solubility is the analytical composition of a saturated solution expressed as a proportion of a designated solute in a designated solvent. Solubility may be stated in various units of concentration such as molarity, molality, mole fraction, mole ratio, mass(solute) per volume(solvent) and other units.

==Molecular view==
Solubility occurs under dynamic equilibrium, which means that solubility results from the simultaneous and opposing processes of [[solvation|dissolution]] and phase joining (e.g., [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of [[solids]]). The solubility equilibrium occurs when the two processes proceed at a constant rate.

The term ''solubility'' is also used in some fields where the solute is altered by [[solvolysis]].  For example, many metals and their [[oxide]]s are said to be &quot;soluble in hydrochloric acid&quot;, although in fact the aqueous acid irreversibly degrades the solid to give soluble products. It is also true that most ionic solids are dissolved by polar solvents, but such processes are reversible.  In those cases where the solute is not recovered upon evaporation of the solvent, the process is referred to as solvolysis. The thermodynamic concept of solubility does not apply straightforwardly to solvolysis.

When  a solute dissolves, it may form several species in the solution. For example, an [[aqueous]] [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of [[Iron(II) hydroxide|ferrous hydroxide]], {{chem|Fe(OH)|2}}, will contain the series [{{chem|Fe(H|2|O)}}''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;(2x)+&lt;/sup&gt; as well as other  species.  Furthermore, the solubility of ferrous hydroxide and the composition of its soluble components depend on [[pH]]. In general, solubility in the solvent phase can be given only for a specific solute that is thermodynamically stable, and the value of the solubility will include all the species in the solution (in the example above, all the iron-containing complexes).

==Factors affecting solubility==
Solubility is defined for specific [[phase (matter)|phases]]. For example, the solubility of [[aragonite]] and [[calcite]] in water are expected to differ, even though they are both [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] of [[calcium carbonate]] and have the same [[chemical formula]].

The solubility of one substance in another is determined by the balance of [[intermolecular force]]s between the solvent and solute, and the [[entropy]] change that accompanies the solvation. Factors such as temperature and pressure will alter this balance, thus changing the solubility.

Solubility may also strongly depend on the presence of other species dissolved in the solvent, for example, [[complex (chemistry)|complex-]]forming anions ([[ligand]]s) in liquids. Solubility will also depend on the excess or deficiency of a common ion in the solution, a phenomenon known as the [[common-ion effect]]. To a lesser extent, solubility will depend on the [[ionic strength]] of solutions. The last two effects can be quantified using the equation for [[solubility equilibrium]].

For a solid that dissolves in a redox reaction, solubility is expected to depend on the potential (within the range of potentials under which the solid remains the thermodynamically stable phase). For example, solubility of gold in high-temperature water is observed to be almost an order of magnitude higher (i.e. about ten times higher) when the redox potential is controlled using a highly oxidizing Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [[redox buffer]] than with a moderately oxidizing Ni-NiO buffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=I.Y.

Solubility (metastable, at concentrations approaching saturation) also depends on the physical size of the crystal or droplet of solute (or, strictly speaking, on the [[specific surface area]] or molar surface area of the solute).&lt;ref name=hefter&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hefter|first1=G.T.|last2=Tomkins|first2=R.P.T (Editors)|title=The Experimental Determination of Solubilities |year=2003|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn= 0-471-49708-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For quantification, see the equation in the article on [[Solubility equilibrium#Particle size effect|solubility equilibrium]]. For highly defective crystals, solubility may increase with the increasing degree of disorder. Both of these effects occur because of the dependence of solubility constant on the Gibbs energy of the crystal. The last two effects, although often difficult to measure, are of practical importance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}  For example, they provide the driving force for [[Ostwald ripening|precipitate aging]] (the crystal size spontaneously increasing with time).

===Temperature===
The solubility of a given solute in a given solvent typically depends on temperature.

Depending on the nature of the solute the solubility may increase or decrease with temperature.
For many solids dissolved in liquid water, the solubility increases with temperature up to 100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name = hill&gt;John W. Hill, Ralph H. Petrucci, ''General Chemistry'', 2nd edition, Prentice Hall, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In liquid water at high temperatures, (e.g., that approaching the [[critical temperature]]), the solubility of ionic solutes tends to decrease due to the change of properties and structure of liquid water; the lower [[dielectric constant]] results in a less [[polar solvent]].

[[Gas]]eous solutes exhibit more complex behavior with temperature. As the temperature is raised, gases usually become less soluble in water (to minimum, which is below 120&amp;nbsp;°C for most permanent gases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=P. Cohen|title=The ASME handbook on Water Technology for Thermal Power Systems|publisher=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers|year=1989| page =442}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but more soluble in organic solvents.&lt;ref name=hill/&gt;

The chart shows solubility curves for some typical solid inorganic [[salt]]s (temperature is in degrees [[Celsius]] i.e. [[Kelvin]] minus 273).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Chemistry and Physics| edition= 27th|location= Cleveland, Ohio|year=1943 |publisher= Chemical Rubber Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many salts behave like [[barium nitrate]] and [[disodium hydrogen arsenate]], and show a large increase in solubility with temperature. Some solutes (e.g., [[sodium chloride]] in water) exhibit solubility that is fairly independent of temperature. A few, such as [[cerium(III) sulfate]], become less soluble in water as temperature increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scientific American&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=What substances, such as cerium sulfate, have a lower solubility when they are heated?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-substances-such-as-c/|accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This temperature dependence is sometimes referred to as &quot;retrograde&quot; or &quot;inverse&quot; solubility. Occasionally, a more complex pattern is observed, as with [[sodium sulfate]], where the less soluble deca[[hydrate]] crystal loses [[water of crystallization]] at 32&amp;nbsp;°C to form a more soluble [[anhydrous]] phase.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[File:Temperature dependence solublity of solid in liquid water high temperature.svg|right|400px]]
The solubility of [[organic compounds]] nearly always increases with temperature. The technique of [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], used for purification of solids, depends on a solute's different solubilities in hot and cold solvent. A few exceptions exist, such as certain [[cyclodextrin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A highly water-soluble 2+1 b-cyclodextrin–fullerene conjugate|author=Salvatore Filippone, Frank Heimanna and André Rassat|journal=[[Chem. Commun.]]|volume=2002|pages=1508–1509|doi=10.1039/b202410a|year=2002|issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pressure===
For condensed phases (solids and liquids), the pressure dependence of solubility is typically weak and usually neglected in practice. Assuming an ideal solution, the dependence can be quantified as:

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{\partial \ln N_i}{\partial P} \right)_T = -\frac{V_{i,aq}-V_{i,cr}} {RT} &lt;/math&gt;

where the index i iterates the components, N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the mole fraction of the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component in the solution, P is the pressure, the index T refers to constant temperature, V&lt;sub&gt;i,aq&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[partial molar volume]] of the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component in the solution, V&lt;sub&gt;i,cr&lt;/sub&gt; is the partial molar volume of the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component in the dissolving solid, and R is the [[universal gas constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E.M. Gutman| title=Mechanochemistry of Solid Surfaces|publisher= World Scientific Publishing Co.|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pressure dependence of solubility does occasionally have practical significance. For example, [[Fouling#Precipitation fouling|precipitation fouling]] of oil fields and wells by [[calcium sulfate]] (which decreases its solubility with decreasing pressure) can result in decreased productivity with time.

==Solubility of gases==
[[Henry's law]] is used to quantify the solubility of gases in solvents.  The solubility of a gas in a solvent is directly proportional to the [[partial pressure]] of that gas above the solvent.  This relationship is written as:
:&lt;math&gt; p = k_{\rm H}\, c &lt;/math&gt;
where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is a temperature-dependent constant (for example, 769.2 [[litre|L]]·[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]/[[Mole (unit)|mol]] for [[Oxygen#Allotropes|dioxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in water at 298 K), ''p'' is the partial pressure (atm), and ''c'' is the [[concentration]] of the dissolved gas in the liquid (mol/L).

The solubility of gases is sometimes also quantified using [[Bunsen solubility coefficient]].

In the presence of small [[Liquid bubble|bubble]]s, the solubility of the gas does not depend on the bubble radius in any other way than through the effect of the radius on pressure (i.e., the solubility of gas in the liquid in contact with small bubbles is increased due to pressure increase by Δp&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2γ/r; see [[Young–Laplace equation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1007/BF00550401| author=G.W. Greenwood|title=The Solubility of Gas Bubbles|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume=4|pages= 320–322|year= 1969|bibcode = 1969JMatS...4..320G| issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry's law is valid for gases that do not undergo speciation on dissolution. [[Sieverts' law]] shows a case when this assumption does not hold.

Solubility of carbon dioxide with temperature is a factor in possible climate change as atmospheric levels increase and there is an increased vapour pressure in the air leading to increased solubility in sea water (affected by temperature and the [[carbonate]] buffer).

==Polarity==
A popular [[aphorism]] used for predicting solubility is &quot;''like dissolves like''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Kenneth J. Williamson| title=Macroscale and Microscale Organic Experiments| page=40|edition= 2nd | publisher=D. C, Heath| location=Lexington, Massachusetts| year=1994| isbn=0-669-19429-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement indicates that a solute will dissolve best in a solvent that has a similar [[chemical structure]] to itself. This view is simplistic, but it is a useful rule of thumb. The overall solvation capacity of a solvent depends primarily on its [[Chemical polarity|polarity]].&lt;ref&gt;The solvent polarity is ''defined'' as its solvation power according to Reichardt&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a very polar ([[hydrophile|hydrophilic]]) solute such as [[urea]] is very soluble in highly polar water, less soluble in fairly polar [[methanol]], and practically insoluble in non-polar solvents such as [[benzene]]. In contrast, a non-polar or [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] solute such as [[naphthalene]] is insoluble in water, fairly soluble in methanol, and highly soluble in non-polar benzene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Merck Index| edition=7th| publisher= Merck &amp; Co.|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In even more simple terms a simple [[Ionic compound|ionic]] (positive-negative) compound such as [[sodium chloride]] (salt) is easily soluble in a highly [[polar]] (positive negative) solvent such as [[water]], as thus the sea is salty.

The solubility is favored by [[entropy of mixing]] and depends on [[enthalpy of dissolution]] and the [[hydrophobic effect]].

Chemists often exploit differences in solubilities to separate and purify compounds from reaction mixtures, using the technique of [[liquid-liquid extraction]]. This applies in areas of chemistry from drug synthesis to nuclear reprocessing.

==Rate of dissolution==
{{main|Dissolution (chemistry)|Solubilization}}
Dissolution is not always an instantaneous process. It is fast when salt and sugar dissolve in water but much slower for a tablet of [[aspirin]] or a large crystal of hydrated [[copper(II) sulfate]].  These observations are the consequence of two factors: the rate of solubilization (in kg/s) is related to the solubility product (dependent on temperature) and the surface area of the material.  The speed at which a solid dissolves may depend on its crystallinity or lack thereof in the case of [[amorphous]] solids and the surface area (crystallite size) and the presence of [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. Many practical systems illustrate this effect, for example in designing methods for controlled [[drug delivery]]. Critically, the dissolution rate may depend on the presence of mixing and other factors that determine the degree of undersaturation in the liquid solvent film immediately adjacent to the solid solute crystal. In some cases, solubility equilibria can take a long time to establish (hours, days, months, or many years; depending on the nature of the solute and other factors). In practice, it means that the amount of solute in a solution is not purely determined by its thermodynamic solubility, but also depends on kinetics of dissolution (or precipitation).

The rate of dissolution and solubility should not be confused as they are different concepts, kinetic and thermodynamic, respectively. The solubilization kinetics, as well as apparent solubility  can be improved after complexation of an active ingredient with cyclodextrin. This can be used in the case of drug with poor solubility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.ejps.2004.06.002| author=A. Gil| year=2004| title = Evolution of the interaction of a new chemical entity, eflucimibe, with gamma-cyclodextrin during kneading process| journal=Eur. J. Pharm. Sciences|volume=23|pages= 123–129| issue=2| pmid=15451000|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly relatively low solubility compounds are found to be soluble in more extreme environments resulting in geochemical and geological observations of the activity of hydrothermal fluids in the Earth's crust. These are often the source of high quality economic mineral deposits and precious or semi-precious gems. In the same way compounds with low solubility will dissolve over extended time (geological time) resulting in significant effects such as extensive cave systems or Karstic land surfaces.

==Quantification of solubility==
Solubility is commonly expressed as a concentration; for example, as g of solute per kg of solvent, [[Mass concentration (chemistry)|g per dL (100mL) of solvent]], [[molarity]], [[molality]], [[mole fraction]], etc. The maximum equilibrium amount of solute that can dissolve per amount of solvent is the solubility of that solute in that solvent under the specified conditions. The advantage of expressing solubility in this manner is its simplicity, while the disadvantage is that it can strongly depend on the presence of other species in the solvent (for example, the common ion effect).

[[Solubility constant]]s are used to describe saturated solutions of ionic compounds &lt;!--not only ionic cmpds--&gt; of relatively low solubility (see [[solubility equilibrium]]). The solubility constant is a special case of an [[equilibrium constant]]. It describes the balance between dissolved ions from the salt and undissolved salt. The solubility constant is also &quot;applicable&quot; (i.e., useful) to [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], the reverse of the dissolving reaction. As with other equilibrium constants, [[temperature]] can affect the numerical value of solubility constant. The solubility constant is not as simple as solubility, however the value of this constant is generally independent of the presence of other species in the solvent.

The [[Flory–Huggins solution theory]] is a theoretical model describing the solubility of polymers. The [[Hansen solubility parameters]] and the [[Hildebrand solubility parameter]]s are empirical methods for the prediction of solubility. It is also possible to predict solubility from other physical constants such as the [[enthalpy of fusion]].

The [[partition coefficient]] ([[Log P]]) is a measure of differential solubility of a compound in a [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] solvent ([[1-octanol]]) and a [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] solvent (water). The logarithm of these two values enables compounds to be ranked in terms of hydrophilicity (or hydrophobicity).

The energy change associated with dissolving is usually given per mole of solute as the [[enthalpy of solution]].

==Applications==
Solubility is of fundamental importance in a large number of scientific disciplines and practical applications, ranging from ore processing and nuclear reprocessing to the use of medicines, and the transport of pollutants.

Solubility is often said to be one of the &quot;characteristic properties of a substance&quot;, which means that solubility is commonly used to describe the substance, to indicate a substance's polarity, to help to distinguish it from other substances, and as a guide to applications of the substance. For example, [[Indigo dye#Chemical properties|indigo]] is described as &quot;insoluble in water, alcohol, or ether but soluble in chloroform, nitrobenzene, or concentrated sulfuric acid&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Solubility of a substance is useful when separating mixtures. For example, a mixture of salt ([[sodium chloride]]) and silica may be separated by dissolving the salt in water, and filtering off the undissolved silica. The synthesis of chemical compounds, by the milligram in a laboratory, or by the ton in industry, both make use of the relative solubilities of the desired product, as well as unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and side products to achieve separation.

Another example of this is the synthesis of [[benzoic acid]] from [[phenylmagnesium bromide]] and [[dry ice]]. Benzoic acid is more soluble in an organic solvent such as [[dichloromethane]] or [[diethyl ether]], and when shaken with this organic solvent in a [[separatory funnel]], will preferentially dissolve in the organic layer. The other reaction products, including the magnesium bromide, will remain in the aqueous layer, clearly showing that separation based on solubility is achieved. This process, known as [[liquid–liquid extraction]], is an important technique in [[synthetic chemistry]]. Recycling is used to ensure maximum extraction.

==Solubility of ionic compounds in water==
{{main|Solubility chart|Solubility table}}
Some ionic compounds ([[salts]]) dissolve in water, which arises because of the attraction between positive and negative charges (see: [[solvation]]).  For example, the salt's positive ions (e.g. Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) attract the partially negative oxygens in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  Likewise, the salt's negative ions (e.g. Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) attract the partially positive hydrogens in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Note: oxygen is partially negative because it is more [[electronegativity|electronegative]] than hydrogen, and vice versa (see: [[chemical polarity]]).

:AgCl&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

However, there is a limit to how much salt can be dissolved in a given volume of water.  This amount is given by the [[solubility product]], K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;.  This value depends on the type of salt (AgCl vs. NaCl, for example), temperature, and the common ion effect.

One can calculate the amount of AgCl that will dissolve in 1 liter of water, some algebra is required.

:K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = [Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] × [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]  (definition of solubility product)
:K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;  (from a table of solubility products)
[Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;], in the absence of other silver or chloride salts,
:[Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;
:[Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 1.34 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;

The result: 1 liter of water can dissolve 1.34 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[mole (unit)|moles]] of AgCl&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature.  Compared with other types of salts, AgCl is poorly soluble in water.  In contrast, table salt (NaCl) has a higher K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; and is, therefore, more soluble.

==Solubility of organic compounds==
The principle outlined above under [[#Polarity|polarity]], that ''like dissolves like'', is the usual guide to solubility with organic systems. For example, [[petroleum jelly]] will dissolve in [[gasoline]] because both petroleum jelly and gasoline are non-polar hydrocarbons. It will not, on the other hand, dissolve in [[ethyl alcohol]] or water, since the polarity of these solvents is too high. Sugar will not dissolve in gasoline, since sugar is too polar in comparison with gasoline. A mixture of gasoline and sugar can therefore be separated by [[filtration]], or [[solvent extraction|extraction]] with water.

==Solubility in non-aqueous solvents==
Most publicly available solubility values are those for solubility in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srdata.nist.gov/solubility/casNO.aspx| title= NIST solubility database}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference also lists some for non-aqueous solvents.  Solubility data for non-aqueous solvents is currently being collected via an [[open notebook science]] [[crowdsourcing]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://onschallenge.wikispaces.com/ |title=ONS Solubility challenge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lxsrv7.oru.edu/~alang/onsc/solubility/allsolvents.php?solute=vanillin| title= Solubility of Vanillin in various non-aqueous solvents}}{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solid solution==
This term is often used in the field of [[metallurgy]] to refer to the extent that an [[alloy]]ing element will dissolve into the [[base metal]] without forming a separate phase. The [[solvus]] or solubility line (or curve) is the line (or lines) on a [[phase diagram]] that give the limits of solute addition. That is, the lines show the maximum amount of a component that can be added to another component and still be in [[solid solution]].  In the solid's crystalline structure, the 'solute' element can either take the place of the matrix within the lattice (a substitutional position; for example, chromium in iron) or take a place in a space between the lattice points (an interstitial position; for example, carbon in iron).

In microelectronic fabrication, solid solubility refers to the maximum concentration of impurities one can place into the substrate.

==Incongruent dissolution==
Many substances dissolve congruently; i.e., the composition of the solid and the dissolved solute stoichiometrically match. However, some substances may dissolve [[Incongruent transition|incongruently]], whereby the composition of the solute in solution does not match that of the solid. This solubilization is accompanied by alteration of the &quot;primary solid&quot; and possibly formation of a secondary solid phase. However, in general, some primary solid also remains and a complex solubility equilibrium establishes. For example, dissolution of [[albite]] may result in formation of [[gibbsite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editors=O.M. Saether &amp; P. de Caritat |title=Geochemical processes, weathering and groundwater recharge in catchments|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis| location=Rotterdam|year=1997| page=6| isbn=90-5410-641-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O = Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 3H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

In this case, the solubility of albite is expected to depend on the solid-to-solvent ratio. This kind of solubility is of great importance in geology, where it results in formation of [[metamorphic rock]]s.

==Solubility prediction==
Solubility is a property of interest in many aspects of science, including but not limited to: environmental predictions, biochemistry, pharmacy, drug-design, agrochemical design, and protein ligand binding. Aqueous solubility is of fundamental interest owing to the vital biological and transportation functions played by water.&lt;ref name = &quot;Skyner et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Skyner | first = R. | coauthors=McDonagh, J.

Methods founded in physical theory tend to use thermodynamic cycles, a concept from classical [[thermodynamics]]. The two common thermodynamic cycles used involve either the calculation of the free energy of [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] (solid to gas without going through a liquid state) and the free energy of solvating a gaseous molecule (gas to solution), or the [[enthalpy of fusion|free energy of fusion]] (solid to a molten phase) and the free energy of mixing (molten to solution). These two process are represented in the following diagrams.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2015}}
In [[physics]], a '''charge''' may refer to one of many different quantities, such as the [[electric charge]] in [[electromagnetism]] or the [[color charge]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Charges correspond to the time-invariant [[generating set of a group|generators]] of a [[symmetry group]], and specifically, to the generators that commute with the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]].  Charges are often denoted by the letter ''Q'', and so the invariance of the charge corresponds to the vanishing [[commutator]] &lt;math&gt;[Q,H]=0&lt;/math&gt;, where H is the Hamiltonian. Thus, charges are associated with conserved [[quantum number]]s; these are the eigenvalues ''q'' of the generator ''Q''.

==Abstract definition==
Abstractly, a charge is any generator of a [[continuous symmetry]] of the physical system under study. When a physical system has a symmetry of some sort, [[Noether's theorem]] implies the existence of a [[conserved current]]. The thing that &quot;flows&quot; in the current is the &quot;charge&quot;, the charge is the [[Lie algebra|generator of the (local) symmetry group]]. This charge is sometimes called the '''Noether charge'''.

Thus, for example, the [[electric charge]] is the generator of the [[U(1)]] symmetry of [[electromagnetism]]. The conserved current is the [[electric current]].

In the case of local, dynamical symmetries, associated with every charge is a [[gauge field]]; when quantized, the gauge field becomes a [[gauge boson]]. The charges of the theory &quot;radiate&quot; the gauge field. Thus, for example, the gauge field of electromagnetism is the [[electromagnetic field]]; and the gauge boson is the [[photon]].

The word &quot;charge&quot; is often used as a synonym for both the generator of a symmetry, and the conserved quantum number (eigenvalue) of the generator. Thus, letting the upper-case letter Q refer to the generator, one has that &lt;math&gt;[Q,H]=0&lt;/math&gt; implies that the eigenvalues (lower-case) q are time-invariant: &lt;math&gt;dq/dt=0&lt;/math&gt;.

So, for example, when the symmetry group is a [[Lie group]], then the charge operators correspond to the simple roots of the [[root system]] of the [[Lie algebra]]; the [[discrete topology|discreteness]] of the root system accounting for the quantization of the charge. The simple roots are used, as all the other roots can be obtained as linear combinations of these.  The general roots are often called raising and lowering operators, or [[ladder operator]]s.

The charge quantum numbers then correspond to the weights of the [[highest-weight module]]s of a given [[representation theory|representation]] of the Lie algebra. So, for example, when a particle in a [[quantum field theory]] belongs to a symmetry, then it transforms according to a particular representation of that symmetry; the charge quantum number is then the weight of the representation.

==Examples==
Various charge quantum numbers have been introduced by theories of [[particle physics]]. These include the charges of the [[Standard Model]]:
* The [[color charge]] of [[quark]]s. The color charge generates the [[SU(3)]] color symmetry of [[quantum chromodynamics]].
* The [[weak isospin]] quantum numbers of the [[electroweak interaction]]. It generates the [[SU(2)]] part of the electroweak SU(2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;U(1) symmetry. Weak isospin is a local symmetry, whose [[gauge boson]]s are the [[W and Z bosons]].
* The [[electric charge]] for electromagnetic interactions. In mathematics texts, this is sometimes referred to as the &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt;-charge of a [[Lie algebra]] [[Weight (representation theory)|module]].

Charges of approximate symmetries:
* The [[strong isospin]] charges. The symmetry groups is [[SU(2)]] [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] symmetry; the gauge bosons are the [[pion]]s. The pions are not [[elementary particle]]s, and the symmetry is only approximate. It is a special case of flavor symmetry.
* Other [[quark]]-flavor charges, such as [[strangeness]] or [[Charm (quantum number)|charm]]. Together with the {{subatomic particle|up quark|link=yes}}–{{subatomic particle|down quark|link=yes}} isospin mentioned above, these generate the global [[SU(6)]] flavor symmetry of the fundamental particles; this symmetry is badly broken by the masses of the heavy quarks.  Charges include the [[hypercharge]], the [[X (charge)|X-charge]] and the [[weak hypercharge]].

Hypothetical charges of extensions to the Standard Model:
* The hypothetical [[magnetic charge]] is another charge in the theory of electromagnetism.  Magnetic charges are not seen experimentally in laboratory experiments, but would be present for theories including [[magnetic monopole]]s.

In [[supersymmetry]]:
* The [[supercharge]] refers to the generator that rotates the fermions into bosons, and vice versa, in the supersymmetry.

In [[conformal field theory]]:
* The [[central charge]] of the [[Virasoro algebra]], sometimes referred to as the ''conformal central charge'' or the [[conformal anomaly]].  Here, the term 'central' is used in the sense of the [[center (group theory)|center]] in group theory: it is an operator that commutes with all the other operators in the algebra. The central charge is the eigenvalue of the [[central extension (mathematics)|central generator]] of the algebra; here, it is the [[energy-momentum tensor]] of the two-dimensional conformal field theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jurgen|last= Fuchs|title=Affine Lie Algebras and Quantum Groups|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-48412-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[gravitation]]:
* Eigenvalues of the energy-momentum tensor correspond to physical [[mass]].

==Charge conjugation==
In the formalism of particle theories charge-like quantum numbers can sometimes be inverted by means of a [[charge conjugation]] operator called C. [[Chiral fermion]]s often cannot.  Charge conjugation simply means that a given symmetry group occurs in two inequivalent (but still [[isomorphic]]) [[group representation]]s.  It is usually the case that the two charge-conjugate representations are [[complex conjugate vector space|complex conjugate]] [[fundamental representation]]s of the Lie group. Their product then forms the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]] of the group.

Thus, a common example is that the [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|product of two charge-conjugate fundamental representations]] of [[SL(2,C)]] (the [[spinor]]s) forms the adjoint rep of the [[Lorentz group]] SO(3,1); abstractly, one writes
:&lt;math&gt;2\otimes\overline{2}=3\oplus 1.\ &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the product of two (Lorentz) spinors is a (Lorentz) vector and a (Lorentz) scalar.  Note that the complex Lie algebra sl(2,C) has a [[compact space|compact]] [[real form]] su(2) (in fact, all Lie algebras have a unique compact real form). The same decomposition holds for the compact form as well: the product of two spinors in [[SU(2)|su(2)]] being a vector in the [[rotation group]] [[O(3)]] and a singlet.  The decompostion is given by the [[Clebsch-Gordon coefficient]]s.

A similar pheonomenon occurs in the compact group [[SU(3)]], where there are two charge-conjugate but inequivalent fundamental representations, dubbed &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{3}&lt;/math&gt;, the number 3 denoting the dimension of the representation, and with the quarks transforming under &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and the antiquarks transforming under &lt;math&gt;\overline{3}&lt;/math&gt;.  The Kronecker product of the two gives

:&lt;math&gt;3\otimes\overline{3}=8\oplus 1.\ &lt;/math&gt;

That is, an eight-dimensional representation, the octet of the [[Eightfold Way (physics)|eight-fold way]], and a [[singlet state|singlet]]. The decomposition of such products of representations into direct sums of irreducible representations can in general be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \otimes \Lambda' = \bigoplus_i \mathcal{L}_i \Lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;

for representations &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The dimensions of the representations obey the &quot;dimension sum rule&quot;:

:&lt;math&gt;d_\Lambda \cdot d_{\Lambda'} = \sum_i \mathcal{L}_i d_{\Lambda_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;d_\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of the representation &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and the integers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Littlewood-Richardson coefficient]]s.  The decomposition of the representations is again given by the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients, this time in the general Lie-algebra setting

The following equations are used for constant pop:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec c = \vec c_0 + \vec p \,t &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\vec s = \vec s_0 + \vec c_0 \,t + \frac{1}{2} \vec p \,t^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\vec p&lt;/math&gt; : constant pop,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec c_0&lt;/math&gt; : initial crackle,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec c&lt;/math&gt; : final crackle,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec s_0&lt;/math&gt; : initial jounce,
:&lt;math&gt;\vec s&lt;/math&gt; : final jounce,

:&lt;math&gt;\vec r&lt;/math&gt; : final position,
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; : time between initial and final states.

The name &quot;pop&quot;, along with &quot;snap&quot; (also referred to as [[jounce]]) and &quot;[[Crackle (physics) |crackle]]&quot; are somewhat facetious terms for the fourth, fifth, and sixth derivatives of position, being a reference to [[Snap, Crackle, and Pop]]. Currently, there are no well-accepted designations for the derivatives of pop. Higher-order derivatives of position are not commonly useful. Thus, there has been no consensus among physicists on the proper names for derivatives above pop. Despite this, physicists have proposed other names such as &quot;lock&quot;, &quot;drop&quot;, &quot;shot&quot;, and &quot;put&quot; for seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth derivatives.

==Unit and dimension==

The dimension of pop '''LT&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;'''. In [[SI units]], this is &quot;metres per hexic second&quot;, &quot;metres per second per second per second per second per second per second&quot;, '''m/s&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, m &amp;middot; s&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;''', or '''100 [[Gal (unit)|Gal]] per quartric second''' in [[CGS]] units. This pattern continues for higher order derivatives
